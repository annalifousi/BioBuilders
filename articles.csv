Bisphenol A (BPA), one of the most diffused ETs, exerts endocrine-disrupting effects through estro-gen-mimicking and hormone-like properties, with detrimental health effects, including on reproduction. However, its impact during the peri-implantation stages is still unclear. This study, using gastruloids as a 3D stem cell-based in vitro model of embryonic development, showed that BPA exposure arrests their axial elongation when present during the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation period by β-catenin protein reduction. Gastruloid reshaping might have been impeded by the downregulation of Snail, Slug and Twist, known to suppress E-cadherin expression and to activate the N-cadherin gene, and by the low expression of the N-cadherin protein. Also, the lack of gastruloids elongation might be related to altered exit of BPA-exposed cells from the pluripotency condition and their following differentiation. In conclusion, here we show that the inhibition of gastruloids' axial elongation by BPA might be the result of the concomitant Wnt/β-catenin perturbation, reduced N-cadherin expression and Oct4, T/Bra and Cdx2 altered patter expression, which all together concur in the impaired development of mouse gastruloids.",PMC11276681

This study aims to explore the associations of prenatal exposure to BPs with thyroid-related hormones (THs) in newborns and early childhood, with a particular focus on the sex-dependent and exposure level effects. Correlated studies were systematically searched from PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane, and Embase until February 21, 2024. The exposures assessed include bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol AF (BPAF), and tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA). THs measured were thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total tri-iodothyronine (TT3), total thyroxine (TT4), free tri-iothyronine (FT3), and free thyroxine (FT4). Effect estimates were quantified using coefficients from multivariable regression models. Statistical analyses were completed using Stata 16.0. The methodological quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Eleven cohort studies comprising 5,363 children were included in our meta-analysis. Prenatal bisphenol concentrations were statistically significant related to alterations in thyroid hormones in children, exclusively in female offspring, including reduced TSH (β = -0.020, 95% CI: -0.036, -0.005) and increased TT3 levels (β = 0.011, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.021), and exposure to high concentration of bisphenols (>1.5 ug/g creatinine) significantly reduced FT3 levels in children (β = -0.011, 95% CI: -0.020, -0.003). Prenatal bisphenol exposure is linked to alterations in thyroid hormone levels in girls, necessitating enhanced measures to control bisphenol exposure levels during pregnancy for child health protection. https://inplasy.com, identifier INPLASY202450129.",PMC11246848

Among these, it has been recognized as an endocrine disruptor. This work aimed to test the effects and potential endocrine disrupting action of glyphosate on PNT1A human prostate cells, an immortalized non-tumor epithelial cell line, possessing both ERα and ERβ estrogen receptors. The results showed that glyphosate induces cytotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and rapid activation of ERα and ERβ via nuclear translocation. Molecular analysis indicated a possible involvement of apoptosis in glyphosate-induced cytotoxicology. The apoptotic process could be attributed to alterations in mitochondrial metabolism; therefore, the main parameters of mitochondrial functionality were investigated using the Seahorse analyzer. Impaired mitochondrial function was observed in glyphosate-treated cells, with reductions in ATP production, spare respiratory capacity, and proton leakage, along with increased efficiency of mitochondrial coupling. Finally, the results of immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that glyphosate acts as an estrogen disruptor determining the nuclear translocation of both ERs. Nuclear translocation occurred independent of dose, faster than the specific hormone, and persisted throughout treatment. In conclusion, the results collected show that in non-tumor prostate cells glyphosate can cause cell death and acts as a xenoestrogen, activating estrogen receptors. The consequent alteration of hormonal functions can have negative effects on the reproductive health of exposed animals, compromising their fertility.",PMC11241661
38984714,"David B Banks, Sydney L Lierz, Ronald E Cannon, Kenneth S Korach",Nongenomic ERα-AMPK Signaling Regulates Sex-Dependent Bcrp Transport Activity at the Blood-Brain Barrier.,2024,The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an extensive capillary network that protects the brain from environmental and metabolic toxins while limiting drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). The ATP-binding cassette transporter breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) reduces drug delivery across the BBB by actively transporting its clinical substrates back into peripheral circulation before their entry into the CNS compartment. 17β-Estradiol (E2)-elicited changes in Bcrp transport activity and expression have been documented previously. We report a novel signaling mechanism by which E2 decreases Bcrp transport activity in mouse brain capillaries via rapid nongenomic signaling through estrogen receptor α. We extended this finding to investigate the effects of different endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) on Bcrp transport function. We also demonstrate sex-dependent expression of Bcrp and E2-sensitive Bcrp transport activity at the BBB ex vivo. This work establishes an explanted tissue-based model by which to interrogate EDCs and SERMs as modulators of nongenomic estrogenic signaling with implications for sex and hormonal regulation of therapeutic delivery into the CNS.,PMC11272090

Their impact on the adrenal cortex and steroidogenesis has not yet been sufficiently elucidated. This applies in particular to the ubiquitously available bisphenols A (BPA), F (BPF), and S (BPS). NCI-H295R adrenocortical cells were exposed to different concentrations (1nM-1mM) of BPA, BPF, BPS, and an equimolar mixture of them (BPmix). After 72 hours, 15 endogenous steroids were measured using LC-MS/MS. Ratios of substrate and product of CYP-regulated steps were calculated to identify most influenced steps of steroidogenesis. mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes was determined by real-time PCR. Cell viability remained unaffected at bisphenol concentrations lower than 250 µM. All tested bisphenols and their combination led to extensive alterations in the quantified steroid levels. The most profound fold changes (FC) in steroid concentrations after exposure to BPA (>10µM) were seen for androstenedione, e.g. a 0.37±0.11-fold decrease at 25µM (p≤0.0001) compared to vehicle-treated controls. For BPF, levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone were significantly increased by 25µM (FC 2.57±0.49, p≤0.001) and 50µM (FC 2.65±0.61, p≤0.0001). BPS treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease of 11-deoxycorticosterone at >1µM (e.g. FC 0.24±0.14, p≤0.0001 at 10µM). However, when combining all three bisphenols, additive effects were detected: e.g. 11-deoxycortisosterone was decreased at doses >10µM (FC 0.27±0.04, p≤0.0001, at 25µM), whereas 21-deoxycortisol was increased by 2.92±0.20 (p≤0.01) at 10µM, and by 3.21±0.45 (p≤0.001) at 50µM. While every measured androgen (DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione, testosterone, DHT) was lowered in all experiments, estradiol levels were significantly increased by BPA, BPF, BPS, and BPmix (e.g. FC 3.60±0.54, p≤0.0001 at 100µM BPF). Calculated substrate-product ratios indicated an inhibition of CYP17A1-, and CYP21A2 mediated conversions, whereas CYP11B1 and CYP19A1 showed higher activity in the presence of bisphenols. Based on these findings, most relevant mRNA expression of CYP genes were analysed. mRNA levels of StAR, CYP11B1, and CYP17A1 were significantly increased by BPF, BPS, and BPmix. In cell culture, bisphenols interfere with steroidogenesis at non-cytotoxic levels, leading to compound-specific patterns of significantly altered hormone levels. These results justify and call for additional in-vivo studies to evaluate effects of EDCs on adrenal gland functionality.",PMC11222671

The reproductive function of females is a well-known target of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. This function holds biological processes that are decisive for the fertility of women themselves and for the health of future generations. However, insufficient research has evaluated the risk of combined mixtures on this function. This study aimed to assess the direct impacts of a realistic exposure to eight combined environmental toxicants on the critical process of folliculogenesis. Female rabbits were exposed daily and orally to either a mixture of eight environmental toxicants (F group) or the solvent mixture (NE group, control) from 2 to 19 weeks of age. The doses were computed from previous toxicokinetic data to reproduce steady-state serum concentrations in rabbits in the range of those encountered in pregnant women. Ovarian function was evaluated through macroscopic and histological analysis of the ovaries, serum hormonal assays and analysis of the expression of steroidogenic enzymes. Cellular dynamics in the ovary were further investigated with Ki67 staining and TUNEL assays. F rabbits grew similarly as NE rabbits but exhibited higher total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in adulthood. They also presented a significantly elevated serum testosterone concentrations, while estradiol, progesterone, AMH and DHEA levels remained unaffected. The measurement of gonadotropins, androstenedione, pregnenolone and estrone levels yielded values below the limit of quantification. Among the 7 steroidogenic enzymes tested, an isolated higher expression of Cyp19a1 was measured in F rabbits ovaries. Those ovaries presented a significantly greater density/number of antral and atretic follicles and larger antral follicles without any changes in cellular proliferation or DNA fragmentation. No difference was found regarding the count of other follicle stages notably the primordial stage, the corpora lutea or AMH serum levels. Folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis seem to be subtly altered by exposure to a human-like mixture of environmental toxicants. The antral follicle growth appears promoted by the mixture of chemicals both in their number and size, potentially explaining the increase in atretic antral follicles. Reassuringly, the ovarian reserve estimated through primordial follicles number/density and AMH is spared from any alteration. The consequences of these changes on fertility and progeny health have yet to be investigated.",PMC11214233

The concern over the consequences of chemical exposures at the global level continues to grow. Because resources are constrained, there is a need to prioritize interventions focused on the greatest health impact. Data, especially related to chemical exposures, are rarely available for most substances of concern, and alternate methods to evaluate their impact are needed. A Structured Expert Judgment (Research Outreach, 2021) process was performed to provide plausible estimates of health impacts for 16 commonly found pollutants: asbestos, arsenic, benzene, chromium, cadmium, dioxins, fluoride, highly hazardous pesticides (HHPs), lead, mercury, polycyclic-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Per- and Polyfluorinated Substances (PFAs), phthalates, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and brominated flame retardants (BRFs). This process, undertaken by sector experts, weighed individual estimations of the probable global health scale health impacts of each pollutant using objective estimates of the expert opinions' statistical accuracy and informativeness. The foremost substances, in terms of mean projected annual total deaths, were lead, asbestos, arsenic, and HHPs. Lead surpasses the others by a large margin, with an estimated median value of 1.7 million deaths annually. The three other substances averaged between 136,000 and 274,000 deaths per year. Of the 12 other chemicals evaluated, none reached an estimated annual death count exceeding 100,000. These findings underscore the importance of prioritizing available resources on reducing and remediating the impacts of these key pollutants. Based on the evidence available, experts concluded some of the more notorious chemical pollutants, such as PCBs and dioxin, do not result in high levels of human health impact from a global scale perspective. However, the chemical toxicity of some compounds released in recent decades, such as Endocrine Disrupters and PFAs, cannot be ignored, even if current impacts are limited. Moreover, the impact of some chemicals may be disproportionately large in some geographic areas. Continued research and monitoring are essential; and a preventative approach is needed for chemicals. These results, and potential similar analyses of other chemicals, are provided as inputs to ongoing discussions about priority setting for global chemicals and pollution management. Furthermore, we suggest that this SEJ process be repeated periodically as new information becomes available.",PMC11195936

Prenatal exposure to BPA has been associated with negative neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in children and in rodent models. Prenatal BPA exposure has also been shown to impair postnatal maternal care provisioning, which can also affect offspring neurodevelopment and behavior. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the biological effects of prenatal exposure to bisphenols other than BPA and the interplay between prenatal bisphenol exposure and postnatal maternal care on adult behavior. The purpose of the current study was to determine the interactive impact of prenatal bisphenol exposure and postnatal maternal care on neurodevelopment and behavior in rats. Our findings suggest that the effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure on eye-opening, adult attentional set shifting and anxiety-like behavior in the open field are dependent on maternal care in the first five days of life. Interestingly, maternal care might also attenuate the effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure on eye opening and adult attentional set shifting. Finally, transcriptomic profiles in male and female medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala suggest that the interactive effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure and postnatal maternal care converge on estrogen receptor signaling and are involved in biological processes related to gene expression and protein translation and synthesis. Overall, these findings indicate that postnatal maternal care plays a critical role in the expression of the effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure on neurodevelopment and adult behavior. Understanding the underlying biological mechanisms involved might allow us to identify potential avenues to mitigate the adverse effects of prenatal bisphenol exposure and improve health and well-being in human populations.",PMC11166292

However, the associations between haloacetic acid (HAA) exposure - a known endocrine disruptor - and sex and thyroid hormones in humans remains unclear. We thus recruited 502 male participants seeking fertility evaluation from a reproductive center.

Multivariable linear regression models were constructed to evaluate the associations between HAA concentrations and hormone measurements. After adjusting for potential confounders and urinary creatinine concentrations, urinary concentrations of TCAA were inversely associated with serum levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), testosterone (T), T/luteinizing hormone ratio (T/LH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (all P for trend < 0.10).

It is crucial to develop and validate suitable in vitro assays capable of measuring the disruption of the thyroid hormone (TH) system. These assays are also essential to comply with the 3R principles, aiming to replace the ex vivo tests often utilised in the chemical assessment. We compared the two commonly used assays applicable for high throughput screening [Luminol and Amplex UltraRed (AUR)] for the assessment of inhibition of thyroid peroxidase (TPO, a crucial enzyme in TH synthesis) using several cell lines and 21 compounds from different use categories. As the investigated cell lines derived from human and rat thyroid showed low or undetectable TPO expression, we developed a series of novel cell lines overexpressing human TPO protein. The HEK-TPOA7 model was prioritised for further research based on the high and stable TPO gene and protein expression. Notably, the Luminol assay detected significant peroxidase activity and signal inhibition even in Nthy-ori 3-1 and HEK293T cell lines without TPO expression, revealing its lack of specificity. Conversely, the AUR assay was specific to TPO activity. Nevertheless, despite the different specificity, both assays identified similar peroxidation inhibitors. Over half of the tested chemicals with diverse structures and from different use groups caused TPO inhibition, including some widespread environmental contaminants suggesting a potential impact of environmental chemicals on TH synthesis. Furthermore, in silico SeqAPASS analysis confirmed the high similarity of human TPO across mammals and other vertebrate classes, suggesting the applicability of HEK-TPOA7 model findings to other vertebrates.",PMC11272733

To investigate associations of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures with MetS risk score in children and identify associated proteins and metabolites. This population-based, birth cohort study used data collected between April 1, 2003, and February 26, 2016, from the Human Early Life Exposome cohort based in France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the UK. Eligible participants included mother-child pairs with measured prenatal EDC exposures and complete data on childhood MetS risk factors, proteins, and metabolites. Data were analyzed between October 2022 and July 2023. Nine metals, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 5 polychlorinated biphenyls, 2 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 5 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 10 phthalate metabolites, 3 phenols, 4 parabens, and 4 organophosphate pesticide metabolites measured in urine and blood samples collected during pregnancy. At 6 to 11 years of age, a composite MetS risk score was constructed using z scores of waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin levels. Childhood levels of 44 urinary metabolites, 177 serum metabolites, and 35 plasma proteins were quantified using targeted methods. Associations were assessed using bayesian weighted quantile sum regressions applied to mixtures for each chemical group.

Most EDC mixtures were associated with elevated proinflammatory proteins, amino acids, and altered glycerophospholipids, which in turn were associated with increased MetS score.

Steroid hormone levels are fundamental for the normal development and function of the human reproductive system, including the ovary. This study aims to elucidate steroidogenesis at different life-stages in human ovaries. We have developed a sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method for 21 important steroid hormones and measured them at different life stages: in media from cultures of human fetal ovaries collected from elective terminations of normally progressing pregnancy and in media from adult ovaries from Caesarean section patients, and follicular fluid from women undergoing infertility treatment. Statistically significant differences in steroid hormone levels and their ratios were calculated with parametric tests. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to explore clustering of the ovarian-derived steroidogenic profiles. Comparison of the 21 steroid hormones revealed clear differences between the various ovarian-derived steroid profiles. Interestingly, we found biosynthesis of both canonical and ""backdoor"" pathway steroid hormones and corticosteroids in first and second trimester fetal and adult ovarian tissue cultures. 17α-estradiol, a less potent naturally occurring isomer of 17β-estradiol, was detected only in follicular fluid. PCA of the ovarian-derived profiles revealed clusters from: adult ovarian tissue cultures with relatively high levels of androgens; first trimester and second trimester fetal ovarian tissue cultures with relatively low estrogen levels; follicular fluid with the lowest androgens, but highest corticosteroid, progestogen and estradiol levels. Furthermore, ratios of specific steroid hormones showed higher estradiol/ testosterone and estrone/androstenedione (indicating higher CYP19A1 activity, p < 0.01) and higher 17-hydroxyprogesterone/progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone /androstenedione (indicating higher CYP17A1 activity, p < 0.01) in fetal compared to adult ovarian tissue cultures.

We used multivariable generalized linear models to identified metabolic features associated with urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and live birth, followed by enriched pathway analysis. We then used a meet-in-the-middle approach to identify overlapping pathways and features. Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis revealed 43 pathways in the C18 negative and 32 pathways in the HILIC positive columns that were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with at least one of the 11 urinary phthalate metabolites or molar sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites. Lipid, amino acid, and carbohydrate metabolism were the most common pathways associated with phthalate exposure. Five pathways, tryptophan metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, biopterin metabolism, carnitine shuttle, and vitamin B6 metabolism, were also identified as being associated with at least one phthalate metabolite and live birth following IVF.

Until now literature in this scope suffers from methodologic limitations in exposure assessment using one or few urine samples and missing assessment during the infancy period.

We studied the associations of four phenols, four parabens, seven phthalates, and one nonphthalate plasticizer from weekly pooled urine samples collected from the mother during second and third trimesters (median 18 and 34 gestational weeks, respectively) and infant at 2 and 12 months of age, and child growth until 36 months. We relied on repeated measures of height, weight and head circumference from study visits and the child health booklet to predict growth outcomes at 3 and 36 months using the Jenss-Bayley nonlinear mixed model. We assessed associations with individual chemicals using adjusted linear regression and mixtures of chemicals using a Bayesian kernel machine regression model. The unipollutant analysis revealed few associations. Bisphenol S (BPS) at second trimester was positively associated with all infant growth parameters at 3 and 36 months, with similar patterns between exposure at third trimester and all infant growth parameters at 3 months. Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) at 12 months was positively associated with body mass index (BMI), weight, and head circumference at 36 months. Mixture analysis revealed positive associations between exposure at 12 months and BMI and weight at 36 months, with MnBP showing the highest effect size within the mixture. This study suggests that exposure in early infancy may be associated with increased weight and BMI in early childhood, which are risk factors of obesity in later life.

The Environmental Reproductive and Glucose Outcomes (ERGO) Study was established to investigate the associations of environmental exposures during the perinatal period with post-pregnancy parental cardiometabolic health. Pregnant individuals aged ≥18 years without pre-existing diabetes were recruited at <15 weeks of gestation from Boston, Massachusetts area hospitals. Participants completed ≤4 prenatal study visits (median: 12, 19, 26, 36 weeks of gestation) and 1 postpartum visit (median: 9 weeks), during which we collected biospecimens, health histories, demographic and behavioural data, and vitals and anthropometric measurements. Participants completed a postpartum fasting 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Clinical data were abstracted from electronic medical records. Ongoing (as of 2024) extended post-pregnancy follow-up visits occur annually following similar data collection protocols. We enrolled 653 unique pregnancies and retained 633 through delivery.

Additionally, certain personal care products used in pregnancy, notably hair oils, were associated with higher urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations, earlier gestational age at delivery and lower birth weight.

Concerns have been especially raised that EDCs might not possess a threshold level such that no exposure level to EDCs can be considered safe. To explore whether or not threshold levels can be identified, we performed a screening exercise on 14 pesticidal and biocidal active substances previously identified as EDCs in the European Union. The respective substances are ideal subjects for case studies to review for endocrine activity and disruptive potential following well-defined regulatory assessment based on solid data to effectually establish adversity as consequence of endocrine disruption. Dimethomorph, metiram and propiconazole for which the weight of evidence demonstrating endocrine disruption was the strongest were used as subjects for further study. Epoxiconazole was additionally selected as its effects on the endocrine system are extensive. For all four substances, analysis of the toxicological data clearly indicated thresholds of adversity below which no adverse effects mediated through an endocrine mechanism were observed. Particular emphasis was placed on mechanistic considerations including homeostasis and the concept of adversity. As a proof of concept this study provides evidence that like other substances of toxicological concern EDCs have threshold levels for adversity. While for some EDCs the respective thresholds might indeed be very low this shows that, data allowing, for other EDCs sufficiently protective reference values can be derived.",PMC11168997
38704805,"Christopher J Borgert, Lyle D Burgoon, John C Matthews",The physiological and biochemical basis of potency thresholds modeled using human estrogen receptor alpha: implications for identifying endocrine disruptors.,2024,"The endocrine system functions by interactions between ligands and receptors. Ligands exhibit potency for binding to and interacting with receptors. Potency is the product of affinity and efficacy. Potency and physiological concentration determine the ability of a ligand to produce physiological effects. The kinetic behavior of ligand-receptor interactions conforms to the laws of mass action. The laws of mass action define the relationship between the affinity of a ligand and the fraction of cognate receptors that it occupies at any physiological concentration. We previously identified the minimum ligand potency required to produce clinically observable estrogenic agonist effects via the human estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα). By examining data on botanical estrogens and dietary supplements, we demonstrated that ERα ligands with potency lower than one one-thousandth that of the primary endogenous hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) do not produce clinically observable estrogenic effects. This allowed us to propose a Human-Relevant Potency Threshold (HRPT) for ERα ligands of 1 × 10-4 relative to E2. Here, we test the hypothesis that the HRPT for ERα arises from the receptor occupancy by the normal metabolic milieu of endogenous ERα ligands. The metabolic milieu comprises precursors to hormones, metabolites of hormones, and other normal products of metabolism. We have calculated fractional receptor occupancies for ERα ligands with potencies below and above the previously established HRPT when normal circulating levels of some endogenous ERα ligands and E2 were also present. Fractional receptor occupancy calculations showed that individual ERα ligands with potencies more than tenfold higher than the HRPT can compete for occupancy at ERα against individual components of the endogenous metabolic milieu and against mixtures of those components at concentrations found naturally in human blood. Ligands with potencies less than tenfold higher than the HRPT were unable to compete successfully for ERα. These results show that the HRPT for ERα agonism (10-4 relative to E2) proposed previously is quite conservative and should be considered strong evidence against the potential for disruption of the estrogenic pathway. For chemicals with potency 10-3 of E2, the potential for estrogenic endocrine disruption must be considered equivocal and subject to the presence of corroborative evidence. Most importantly, this work demonstrates that the endogenous metabolic milieu is responsible for the observed ERα agonist HRPT, that this HRPT applies also to ERα antagonists, and it provides a compelling mechanistic explanation for the HRPT that is grounded in basic principles of molecular kinetics using well characterized properties and concentrations of endogenous components of normal metabolism.",PMC11106131

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between EDC exposure and asymmetric FGR. This was a prospective cohort study including women admitted for delivery to the Maternal Fetal Center at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital between October 2021 and October 2022. Maternal urine and cord blood samples were collected, and the levels of bisphenol-A (BPA), monoethyl phthalates, and perfluorooctanoic acid in each specimen were analyzed. We investigated linear and non-linear associations between the levels of EDCs and fetal growth parameters, including the head circumference (HC)/abdominal circumference (AC) ratio as an asymmetric parameter. The levels of EDCs were compared between fetuses with and without asymmetric FGR. Of the EDCs, only the fetal levels of BPA showed a linear association with the HC/AC ratio after adjusting for confounding variables (β = 0.003, p < 0.05). When comparing the normal growth and asymmetric FGR groups, the asymmetric FGR group showed significantly higher maternal and fetal BPA levels compared to the normal growth group (maternal urine BPA, 3.99 μg/g creatinine vs. 1.71 μg/g creatinine [p < 0.05]; cord blood BPA, 1.96 μg/L vs. -0.86 μg/L [p < 0.05]).

The newly isolated E2-degrading strain Sphingomonas colocasiae C3-2 can degrade E2 through both the 4,5-seco pathway and the 9,10-seco pathway; the former is the primary pathway supporting the growth of this strain and the latter is a branching pathway. The novel gene cluster ean was found to be responsible for E2 degradation through the 4,5-seco pathway, where E2 is converted to estrone (E1) by EanA, which belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDR) superfamily. A three-component oxygenase system (including the P450 monooxygenase EanB1, the small iron-sulfur protein ferredoxin EanB2, and the ferredoxin reductase EanB3) was responsible for hydroxylating E1 to 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH-E1). The enzymatic assay showed that the proportion of the three components is critical for its function. The dioxygenase EanC catalyzes ring A cleavage of 4-OH-E1, and the oxidoreductase EanD is responsible for the decarboxylation of the ring A-cleavage product of 4-OH-E1. EanR, a TetR family transcriptional regulator, acts as a transcriptional repressor of the ean cluster. The ean cluster was also found in other reported E2-degrading sphingomonads. In addition, the novel two-component monooxygenase EanE1E2 can open ring B of 4-OH-E1 via the 9,10-seco pathway, but its encoding genes are not located within the ean cluster. These results refine research on genes involved in E2 degradation and enrich the understanding of the cleavages of ring A and ring B of E2.IMPORTANCESteroid estrogens have been detected in diverse environments, ranging from oceans and rivers to soils and groundwater, posing serious risks to both human health and ecological safety. The United States National Toxicology Program and the World Health Organization have both classified estrogens as Group 1 carcinogens.

The concentrations of estradiol (E2), progesterone (PG), anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), and inhibin B, as well as that of 12 phthalate metabolites and 12 phenolic chemicals were measured in each FF sample. Multivariate linear regression model was used to identify the drivers of hormone levels based on participant's age, BMI, smoking status, and chemical exposure for the monitored chemicals detected in more than 50% of the samples. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction was applied on the resulting p values (q value). FF samples were obtained from 72 women (mean age 30.9 years). Most of the phthalates and phenolic substances monitored (21/24, 88%) were identified in FF. Ten compounds (7 phthalate metabolites, 3 phenols) were found in more than 50% of samples.

Alterations in amelogenesis, caused by chemical and physical trauma that occur during the antenatal, perinatal and postnatal time periods, may result in developmental defects in deciduous and permanent tooth enamel, as demonstrated in animal studies. These defects can be clinically visible and result in a variety of morphological and functional problems in the dentition. Since enamel does not remodel after formation, it may serve as a permanent record of insults during organ development.Our primary purpose was to investigate any possible relationship between intrauterine exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (phenols and phthalates) and developmental defects in enamel in children, while also accounting for fluoride exposure. Our secondary purpose was to report descriptively on findings from comprehensive dental examinations performed on 356 children that were drawn from the general paediatric population. A cohort of children from the Utah Children's Project (N = 356) that had full medical exams, comprehensive medical and family histories and available biospecimens were given extraoral and intraoral examinations.

Standardized intraoral photographs were taken of the teeth and viewed by standardised examiners and the dental observations were recorded for a full inventory of findings, including: tooth morphology, caries, restorations, colorations, attrition, erosion, fractures and hypomineralization. Perinatal maternal urine samples were assessed for the concentration of fluoride, phenols and phthalates, including bisphenol A (BPA).Pairwise statistical analyses were done to correlate the dental findings with one another and with the presence of environment chemicals found in the urine samples. Hypomineralization was the most common finding (96% of children; 37% of deciduous teeth, 42% of permanent teeth), consistent with molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) described in other human populations. No consistent correlations were seen between dental findings and the presence of phenols and phthalates in prenatal urine, but the number of samples available for the assessment was limited (n = 35).In conclusion, we found a high proportion of dental hypomineralization in a population based paediatric cohort, but did not find an association with prenatal exposure to phenols and phthalates.",PMC10929125

High levels of circulating androgens are linked to PCa in men and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in women. Essential oils or their metabolites, like lavender oil and tea tree oil, have been reported to act as potential EDCs and contribute towards sex steroid imbalance in cases of prepubertal gynecomastia in boys and premature thelarche in girls due to the exposure to lavender-based fragrances. We screened a range of EO components to determine their effects on CYP17A1 and CYP19A1. Computational docking was performed to predict the binding of essential oils with CYP17A1 and CYP19A1. Functional assays were performed using the radiolabeled substrates or Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry and cell viability assays were carried out in LNCaP cells. Many of the tested compounds bind close to the active site of CYP17A1, and (+)-Cedrol had the best binding with CYP17A1 and CYP19A1.

Extensive use of these essential oils in various beauty and hygiene products is common, but only limited knowledge about their potential detrimental side effects exists. Our results suggest that prolonged exposure to some of these essential oils may result in steroid imbalances.

Previously, we reported that adrenal cells are important targets of individual OPEs. However, real-life exposures are to complex mixtures of these chemicals. To address this, we exposed H295R human adrenal cells to varying dilutions (1/1000K to 1/3K) of a Canadian household dust-based OPE mixture for 48 hours and evaluated effects on phenotypic, lipidomic, and functional parameters. Using a high-content screening approach, we assessed phenotypic markers at mixture concentrations at which there was greater than 70% cell survival; the most striking effect of the OPE mixture was a 2.5-fold increase in the total area of lipid droplets. We then determined the response of specific lipid species to OPE exposures with novel, nontargeted lipidomic analysis of isolated lipid droplets. These data revealed that house dust OPEs induced concentration-dependent alterations in the composition of lipid droplets, particularly affecting the triglyceride, diglyceride, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol ester subclasses. The steroid-producing function of adrenal cells in the presence or absence of a steroidogenic stimulus, forskolin, was determined. While the production of 17β-estradiol remained unaffected, a slight decrease in testosterone production was observed after stimulation. Conversely, a 2-fold increase in both basal and stimulated cortisol and aldosterone production was observed. Thus, exposure to a house dust-based mixture of OPEs exerts endocrine-disrupting effects on adrenal cells, highlighting the importance of assessing the effects of environmentally relevant mixtures.",PMC10914377

Although ample study has been directed toward the immunosuppressive effects of androgens, considerable disagreement remains regarding their influence on immune function. In this study, we test the hypothesis that androgens inhibit immunocompetence in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis). Developing alligators were incubated at female-producing temperatures with a subset of individuals being exposed to 17-α-methyltestosterone (MT) before sexual determination. 17-α-methyltestosterone is a potent androgen, not aromatizable by crocodilians, that has been found to exert masculinizing effects in exposed crocodilian populations in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, a subset of animals was exposed to a novel antigen to quantify innate and acquired immune function. We recovered no significant differences in leukocyte ratios or proportions between groups and found no significant differences in innate immune function as measured by hemolysis-hemagglutination. However, we did find significant differences in acquired immune function, where masculinized individuals expressed greater antibody titers.

Neurodevelopmental scores were assessed using Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) at age 3. We used mean field variational Bayes for lagged kernel machine regression (MFVB-LKMR) to investigate the association between trimester-specific co-exposure to the six EDCs and MSEL scores at age 3, stratified by sex. The analysis included 130 children. For females, the relationship between BPA and 3PBA with MSEL score varied between the two trimesters. In the second trimester, effect estimates for BPA were null but inversely correlated with MSEL score in the third trimester. 3PBA had a negative relationship with MSEL in the second trimester and positive correlation in the third trimester. For males, effect estimates for all EDCs were in opposing directions across trimesters. MFVB-LKMR analysis identified significant two-way interaction between EDCs for MSEL scores in both trimesters.

However, in managing the many thousands of uncharacterized chemical entities, the high-throughput screening of EDCs using relevant biological endpoints remains challenging. Three-dimensional (3D) culture technology enables the development of more physiologically relevant systems in more realistic biochemical microenvironments. The high-content and quantitative imaging techniques enable quantifying endpoints associated with cell morphology, cell-cell interaction, and microtissue organization. In the present study, 3D microtissues formed by MCF-7 breast cancer cells were exposed to the model EDCs estradiol (E2) and propyl pyrazole triol (PPT). A 3D imaging and image analysis pipeline was established to extract quantitative image features from estrogen-exposed microtissues. Moreover, a machine-learning classification model was built using estrogenic-associated differential imaging features. Based on 140 common differential image features found between the E2 and PPT group, the classification model predicted E2 and PPT exposure with AUC-ROC at 0.9528 and 0.9513, respectively. Deep learning-assisted analysis software was developed to characterize microtissue gland lumen formation. The fully automated tool can accurately characterize the number of identified lumens and the total luminal volume of each microtissue. Overall, the current study established an integrated approach by combining non-supervised image feature profiling and supervised luminal volume characterization, which reflected the complexity of functional ER signaling and highlighted a promising conceptual framework for estrogenic EDC risk assessment.",PMC10844358

In addition to their roles in growth and development, hormones also mediate responses to the abiotic, social and nutritional environments. Hormone signalling is responsive to environmental changes to adjust phenotypes to prevailing conditions. Both hormone levels and receptor densities can change to provide a flexible system of regulation. Endocrine flexibility connects the environment to organismal function, and it is central to understanding environmental impacts and their effect on individuals and populations. Hormones may also act as a 'sensor' to link environmental signals to epigenetic processes and thereby effect phenotypic plasticity within and across generations. Many environmental parameters are now changing in unprecedented ways as a result of human activity. The knowledge base of organism-environmental interactions was established in environments that differ in many ways from current conditions as a result of ongoing human impacts. It is an urgent contemporary challenge to understand how evolved endocrine responses will modulate phenotypes in response to anthropogenic environmental impacts including climate change, light-at-night and chemical pollution. Endocrine responses play a central role in ecology, and their integration into conservation can lead to more effective outcomes.

Epigenetic regulation by small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), such as microRNAs (miRNA), is crucial for controlling cancer development. The aim of this study was to analyze transcriptional activity and sncRNA expression changes in the KGN cell line after acute (3 h) and chronic (72 h) exposure to 10 nM TCDD in order to determine whether sncRNAs' deregulation may contribute to transmitting TCDD effects to the subsequent cell generations (day 9 and day 14 after chronic exposure). Using Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 4.0 arrays, 109 sncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (fold change < -2 or >2; p-value < 0.05) between cells exposed or not (control) to TCDD for 3 h and 72 h and on day 9 and day 14 after chronic exposure. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted that following the acute and chronic exposure of KGN cells, sncRNAs linked to cellular development, growth and proliferation were downregulated, and those linked to cancer promotion were upregulated on day 9 and day 14.

Mothers were knowledgeable about EDCs and actively needed further education and support. While they tended to focus more on the health impact of EDCs on their children and were optimistic about their health risks, paying less attention to their preventive behaviors.

Identifying chemicals with these activities can prompt steps to protect human health. We compiled data on rodent tumors, endocrine activity, and genotoxicity to assess the key characteristics (KCs) of rodent mammary carcinogens (MCs), and to identify other chemicals that exhibit these effects and may therefore increase BC risk. Using authoritative databases, including International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs and the US Environmental Protection's (EPA) ToxCast, we selected chemicals that induce mammary tumors in rodents, stimulate estradiol or progesterone synthesis, or activate the estrogen receptor (ER) in vitro. We classified these chemicals by their genotoxicity and strength of endocrine activity and calculated the overrepresentation (enrichment) of these KCs among MCs. Finally, we evaluated whether these KCs predict whether a chemical is likely to induce mammary tumors. We identified 279 MCs and an additional 642 chemicals that stimulate estrogen or progesterone signaling. MCs were significantly enriched for steroidogenicity, ER agonism, and genotoxicity, supporting the use of these KCs to predict whether a chemical is likely to induce rodent mammary tumors and, by inference, increase BC risk. More MCs were steroidogens than ER agonists, and many increased both estradiol and progesterone. Enrichment among MCs was greater for strong endocrine activity vs. weak or inactive, with a significant trend. We identified hundreds of compounds that have biological activities that could increase BC risk and demonstrated that these activities are enriched among MCs. We argue that many of these should not be considered low hazard without investigating their ability to affect the breast, and chemicals with the strongest evidence can be targeted for exposure reduction. We describe ways to strengthen hazard identification, including improved assessments for mammary effects, developing assays for more KCs, and more comprehensive chemical testing. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13233.",PMC10777819

Despite the lack of a standardized guideline, the avian embryo has been shown to be a promising model system which responds sensitively to EDCs. After previous studies on the effects of estrogenic, antiestrogenic and androgenic substances, the present work focuses on the effects of in ovo exposure to p,p'-DDE, flutamide and cyproterone acetate (CPA) as antiandrogenic model compounds regarding gonadal sex differentiation and embryonic development of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus). The substances were injected into the yolk of fertilized eggs on embryonic day one. On embryonic day 19 sex genotype and phenotype were determined, followed by gross morphological and histological examination of the gonads. Treatment with flutamide (0.5, 5, 50 µg/g egg), p,p'-DDE (0.5, 5, 50 µg/g egg) or CPA (0.2, 2, 20 µg/g egg) did not affect male or female gonad development, assessed by gonad surface area and cortex thickness in both sexes and by the percentage of seminiferous tubules in males as endpoints. This leads to the conclusion that antiandrogens do not affect sexual differentiation during embryonic development of G. gallus domesticus, reflecting that gonads are not target organs for androgens in birds. In ovo exposure to 2 and 20 µg CPA/g egg, however, resulted in significantly smaller embryos as displayed by shortened lengths of skull, ulna and tarsometatarsus. Although gonadal endpoints were not affected by antiandrogens, the embryo of G. gallus domesticus is shown to be a suitable test system for the identification of substance-related mortality and developmental delays.",PMC10601917

We hypothesized that starting a 28-day in vivo toxicity study already at weaning, instead of in adulthood, would increase the sensitivity to detect endocrine disruptors due to the possibility of including assessment of pubertal onset. We compared the sensitivity of two rat studies using pubertal or adult exposure. We exposed the rats to two well-known human endocrine disruptors, the estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES; 0.003, 0.012, 0.048 mg/kg bw/day) and the steroid synthesis inhibitor ketoconazole (KTZ; 3, 12, 48 mg/kg bw/day). Specifically, we addressed the impact on established endocrine-sensitive endpoints including day of vaginal opening (VO), estrous cyclicity, weights of reproductive organs and ovarian histology. After 28 days of exposure, starting either at weaning or at 9 weeks of age, DES exposure altered estrous cyclicity, reduced ovary weight as well as number of antral follicles and corpora lutea. By starting exposure at weaning, we could detect advanced day of VO in DES-exposed animals despite a lower body weight. Some endpoints were affected mainly with adult exposure, as DES increased liver weights in adulthood only. For KTZ, no effects were seen on time of VO, but adrenal and liver weights were increased in both exposure scenarios, and adult KTZ exposure also stimulated ovarian follicle growth. At first glance, this would indicate that a pubertal exposure scenario would be preferrable as timing of VO may serve as sensitive indicator of endocrine disruption by estrogenic mode of action. However, a higher sensitivity for other endocrine targets may be seen starting exposure in adulthood. Overall, starting a 28-day study at weaning with inclusion of VO assessment would mainly be recommended for substances showing estrogenic potential e.g., in vitro, whereas for other substances an adult exposure scenario may be recommended.",PMC10579898

Studies have mainly focused on individual aspects of growth at specific time points using single chemical exposure models. However, humans are exposed to multiple EDCs simultaneously, and growth is a dynamic process. The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and children's body mass index (BMI) growth trajectories using single exposure and mixture modeling approaches. Using data from the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Spanish birth cohort (n=1,911), prenatal exposure to persistent chemicals [hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 4-4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB-138, -150, and -180), 4 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)] and nonpersistent chemicals (8 phthalate metabolites, 7 phenols) was assessed using blood and spot urine concentrations. BMI growth trajectories were calculated from birth to 9 years of age using latent class growth analysis. Multinomial regression was used to assess associations for single exposures, and Bayesian weighted quantile sum (BWQS) regression was used to evaluate the EDC mixture's association with child growth trajectories. In single exposure models exposure to HCB, DDE, PCBs, and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were associated with increased risk of belonging to a trajectory of lower birth size followed by accelerated BMI gain by 19%-32%, compared with a trajectory of average birth size and subsequent slower BMI gain [e.g., relative risk ratio (RRR) per doubling in DDE concentration=1.19 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.35); RRR for PFNA=1.32 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.66)]. HCB and DDE exposure were also associated with higher probability of belonging to a trajectory of higher birth size and accelerated BMI gain. Results from the BWQS regression showed the mixture was positively associated with increased odds of belonging to a BMI trajectory of lower birth size and accelerated BMI gain (odds ratio per 1-quantile increase of the mixture=1.70; credible interval: 1.03, 2.61), with HCB, DDE, and PCBs contributing the most. This study provides evidence that prenatal EDC exposure, particularly persistent EDCs, may lead to BMI trajectories in childhood characterized by accelerated BMI gain. Given that accelerated growth is linked to a higher disease risk in later life, continued research is important. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11103.",PMC10583704

The effects of the xenobiotics were assessed by analyzing cell proliferation, mitochondrial functionality, and the expression of genes involved in pluripotency and epigenetic regulation, which are crucial for early human development. Our findings demonstrate that antenatal exposure to BPs and/or PFs may alter the biological characteristics of perinatal stem cells and fetal epigenome, with potential implications for health outcomes at birth and in adulthood.

In vitro methods included receptor-binding, CALUX transactivation, H295R steroidogenesis, aromatase activity inhibition and the Yeast oestrogen (YES) and Yeast androgen screen (YAS) assays. The impact of metabolism was also evaluated. The YES/YAS assays exhibited a high sensitivity for ER effects and, despite some challenges in predicting AR effects, is a good initial screening assay. Results from receptor-binding and CALUX assays generally correlated and were in accordance with classifications based on ToxCast assays. ER agonism and AR antagonism of benzyl butyl phthalate were abolished when CALUX assays included liver S9. In silico final calls were mostly in agreement with the in vitro assays, and predicted ER and AR effects well. The efficiency of the in silico models (reflecting applicability domains or inconclusive results) was 43-100%. The percentage of correct calls for ER (50-100%), AR (57-100%) and aromatase (33-100%) effects when compared to the final ToxCast call covered a wide range from highly reliable to less reliable models. In conclusion, Danish (Q)SAR, Opera, ADMET Lab LBD and ProToxII models demonstrated the best overall performance for ER and AR effects. These can be combined with the YES/YAS assays in an initial screen of chemicals in the early tiers of an NGRA to inform on the MoA and the design of mechanistic in vitro assays used later in the assessment.

Using the expression data, we performed differential expression and gene set enrichment analysis. We also exposed the human thyroid follicular epithelial cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 to 1 µM of DEHP or DINP for 5 days and analyzed changes in chromatin accessibility via ATAC-Seq. Dose-series analysis showed how the expression of several genes increased or decreased at the highest dose tested. As expected with the low dosing scheme, the compounds induced a modest response on the transcriptome, as we identified changes in only mmu-miR-143-3p after DINP treatment and very few differentially expressed genes. No effect was observed on thyroid markers. Ing5, a component of histones H3 and H4 acetylation complexes, was consistently upregulated in three out of four conditions compared to control, and we observed a partial overlap among the genes differentially expressed by the treatments. Gene set enrichment analysis showed enrichment in the treatment samples of the fatty acid metabolism pathway and in the control of pathways related to the receptor signalling and extracellular matrix organization. ATAC-Seq analysis showed a general increase in accessibility compared to the control, however we did not identify significant changes in accessibility in the identified regions.

Toxicant-induced changes in relative abundance and/or impairment of these cell types likely contribute to placental pathogenesis.

However, data about reproductive toxicity spectrum of phthalate metabolites among Chinese women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments are scarce yet. Previous studies regarding underlying embryo toxicities focused on oxidative stress and apoptosis, while energy metabolism abnormality might be another key cause for embryo developmental disruptions. Here, we found that among the measured eight phthalate metabolites, monomethyl phthalate (MMP) had the second highest urinary concentration in women receiving IVF. Compare to the lowest exposure level group, MMP in tertile 3 was associated with fewer counts of oocyte retrieved and good-quality embryos, and MMP in tertile 2 was correlated with reduced good-quality embryo rate. The direct embryo toxicities of MMP were studied using mouse 2-cell embryos. Consistent to results found in human populations, exposure to MMP induced mouse early embryo developmental delay. Furthermore, MMP exposure led to excessive reactive oxygen species production in early embryos, and antioxidant can partially rescue the early embryo development slow down. Embryo apoptosis could also be caused by oxidative stress. To be noted, elevated apoptosis level was not found in live ""slow"" embryos but dead embryos, which suggested that apoptosis was not related to early embryo developmental delay. Additionally, MMP exposure depleted adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis of early embryos, which could be reversed by antioxidant. In conclusion, MMP, as the newly found embryonic toxicant in Chinese women, resulted in early embryo development delay, apoptosis, and energy metabolism disruptions via inducing redox imbalance.",8701112

Gestational exposure may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. In a rat model, perinatal exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture and dose of phthalates leads to increased developmental apoptosis in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and a subsequent reduction in neurons and in cognitive flexibility measured in adults of both sexes (Sellinger et al., 2021b; Kougias et al., 2018b). However, whether these effects generalize to other cognitive regions, like the hippocampus, is less well understood as existing studies used single phthalates at large doses, unrepresentative of human exposure. In the current study, patterns of naturally occurring cell death were first established in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal subfields (CA3 and CA1). Both dorsal and ventral CA3 reached high levels of cell death on P2 while levels in dorsal and ventral CA1 peaked on P5 in both sexes. Exposure to a phthalate mixture (0.2 and 1 mg/kg/day) throughout gestation through postnatal day 10 resulted in subtle age- and region-specific decreases in developmental cell death, however there were no significant changes in adult neuron number or associated behaviors: the Morris water maze and social recognition. Therefore, perinatal exposure to a low dose mixture of phthalates does not result in the dramatic structural and behavioral changes seen with high doses of single phthalates. This study also adds to our understanding of the distinct neurodevelopmental effects of phthalates on different brain regions.",PMC10530334

WoE methods consider all data pertinent to satisfying the EDC definition and evaluating those data with respect to relevance, reliability, strength, and coherence with established endocrine physiology and pharmacology. A new approach for identifying EDC hazards has been proposed that organizes and evaluates data according to ten so-called ""Key Characteristics (KCs) of EDCs"". The approach claims to address the lack of a widely accepted, systematic approach for identifying EDC hazards, but completely ignores the WoE literature for EDCs. In contrast to WoE methods, the KC approach fails to apply the consensus definition of EDC and is not amenable to empirical testing or validation, is fungible and ensures inconsistent and unreliable results, ignores principles of hormone action and characteristics of dose-response in endocrine pharmacology and toxicology, lacks a means of distinguishing endocrine-mediated from non-endocrine mediated mechanisms, lacks a means to reach a negative conclusion about a chemical's EDC properties or to distinguish EDCs from non-EDCs, and provides no means for developing a valid consensus among experts nor provides a means of resolving conflicting interpretations of data.

This study investigated the impact of maternal and prepubertal codeine exposure on spermatogenesis and sperm quality in F1 male Wistar rats to study the effect that codeine may have during recreational use in humans. Also, the effect of arginine supplementation on codeine-induced alteration in spermatogenesis and sperm quality was evaluated. Female rats were treated with either 0.5 ml distilled water or codeine orally for eight weeks, and then mated with male rats (female:male, 2:1). The F1 male offsprings of both cohorts were weaned at 3 weeks old and administered distilled water, codeine, arginine, or codeine with arginine orally for eight weeks. Prepubertal codeine exposure in rats whose dams (female parents) were exposed to codeine delayed puberty and reduced the weight at puberty. Prepubertal codeine exposure exacerbated maternal codeine exposure-induced reduced total and daily spermatid production, sperm count, sperm motility, and normal sperm form, as well as impaired sperm plasma membrane integrity and increased not intact acrosome and damaged sperm DNA integrity. These perturbations were accompanied by a decrease in mRNA levels encoding spermatogenic genes, testicular testosterone and androgen receptor (AR) concentrations, and upregulation of sperm 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8OHdG). Prepubertal arginine supplementation mitigated codeine-induced alterations.

Besides, immobilizing fungal cells onto nanofibrous membranes appears as an innovative strategy to improve remediation performance by allowing the adsorption and degradation to occur simultaneously. Herein, we developed a novel nanostructured bioremediation platform based on polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (PAN NFM) as supporting material for immobilizing an endophytic fungus to remove bisphenol A (BPA), a typical EDC. The endophytic strain was isolated from Handroanthus impetiginosus leaves and identified as Phanerochaete sp. H2 by molecular methods. The successful assembly of fungus onto the PAN NFM surface was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Compared with free fungus cells, the PAN@H2 NFM displayed a high BPA removal efficiency (above 85%) at an initial concentration of 5 ppm, suggesting synergistic removal by simultaneous adsorption and biotransformation.

April-June 2016, 185 women undergoing ovum pick-up for in vitro fertilisation in Sweden were recruited. Correlation analyses were performed between self-reported lifestyle factors and concentration of EDCs analysed in follicular fluid. Habits related to cleaning, PCPs, and diet were assessed together with concentration of six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) [PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA], methyl paraben and eight phthalate metabolites [MECPP, MEHPP, MEOHP, MEHP, cxMinCH, cxMiNP, ohMiNP, MEP, MOHiBP]. Spearman's partial correlations were adjusted for age, parity and BMI. Significant associations were discovered between multiple lifestyle factors and concentrations of EDCs in ovarian follicular fluid. After correcting p values for multiple testing, frequent use of perfume was associated with MEP (correlation ρ = 0.41 (confidence interval 0.21-0.47), p < 0.001); hens' egg consumption was positively associated with PFOS (ρ = 0.30 (0.15-0.43), p = 0.007) and PFUnDA (ρ = 0.27 (0.12-0.40), p = 0.036).

More correlations were discovered when considering the raw uncorrected p values. Altogether, our results suggest that multiple lifestyle variables affect chemical contamination of follicular fluid. This study shows how lifestyle factors correlate with the level of contamination in the ovary by both persistent and semi-persistent chemicals in women of reproductive age. Subsequently, these data can be used to form recommendations regarding lifestyle to mitigate possible negative health outcomes and fertility problems associated with chemical exposure, and to inform chemical policy decision making.

This dramatic decrease in fertility can be attributed in part to our increasing exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is an estrogenic EDC that was prescribed to millions of pregnant women between 1940 and 1970 and resulted in detrimental reproductive effects in the offspring that were exposed in utero. Women who were exposed to DES in utero experienced higher rates of infertility, pregnancy complications, and reproductive cancers. Alarmingly, there is evidence to suggest that these effects may persist in the grandchildren and great grandchildren of exposed women. To define the transgenerational reproductive impacts in females following exposure to DES, gestating mice were exposed to DES and the effects monitored in the female descendants across 3 generations. There was a trend for reduced pregnancy rate and fertility index seen across the generations and moreover, the anogenital distance (AGD) was significantly reduced up until the third, unexposed generation. The onset of puberty was also significantly affected, with the timing of vaginal opening occurring significantly earlier in DES descendants. These results indicate a transgenerational effect of DES on multiple reproductive parameters including fertility, timing of puberty, and AGD. These data have significant implications for more than 50 million DES descendants worldwide as well as raising concerns for the ongoing health impacts caused by exposures to other estrogenic EDCs which are pervasive in our environment.",PMC10464516

EDCs are metabolized through hepatic enzymes, causing altered transcriptional activities of hormone receptors, and thus necessitating the exploration of the potential endocrine-disrupting activities of EDC-derived metabolites. Accordingly, we have developed an integrative workflow for evaluating the post-metabolic activity of potential hazardous compounds. The system facilitates the identification of metabolites that exert hormonal disruption through the integrative application of an MS/MS similarity network and predictive biotransformation based on known hepatic enzymatic reactions. As proof-of-concept, the transcriptional activities of 13 chemicals were evaluated by applying the in vitro metabolic module (S9 fraction). Identified among the tested chemicals were three thyroid hormone receptor (THR) agonistic compounds that showed increased transcriptional activities after phase I+II reactions (T3, 309.1 ± 17.3%; DITPA, 30.7 ± 1.8%; GC-1, 160.6 ± 8.6% to the corresponding parents). The metabolic profiles of these three compounds showed common biotransformation patterns, particularly in the phase II reactions (glucuronide conjugation, sulfation, GSH conjugation, and amino acid conjugation). Data-dependent exploration based on molecular network analysis of T3 profiles revealed that lipids and lipid-like molecules were the most enriched biotransformants. The subsequent subnetwork analysis proposed 14 additional features, including T4 in addition to 9 metabolized compounds that were annotated by prediction system based on possible hepatic enzymatic reaction. The other 10 THR agonistic negative compounds showed unique biotransformation patterns according to structural commonality, which corresponded to previous in vivo studies. Our evaluation system demonstrated highly predictive and accurate performance in determining the potential thyroid-disrupting activity of EDC-derived metabolites and for proposing novel biotransformants.",PMC10619556

Little is known about the long-term effects of exposure to PCB mixtures on the rat ovary during critical developmental periods. Thus, this study tested whether prenatal and postnatal exposures to PCBs affect follicle numbers and gene expression in the ovaries of F1 offspring. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle or Aroclor 1221 (A1221) at 1 mg/kg/day during embryonic days 8-18 and/or postnatal days (PND) 1-21. Ovaries from F1 rats were collected for assessment of follicle numbers and differential expression of estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1), estrogen receptor 2 (Esr2), androgen receptor (Ar), progesterone receptor (Pgr), and Ki-67 (Ki67) at PNDs 8, 32, and 60. Sera were collected for measurement of estradiol concentrations. Prenatal exposure to A1221 significantly decreased the number of primordial follicles and the total number of follicles at PND 32 compared to control. Postnatal PCB exposure borderline increased Ki67 gene expression and significantly increased Ki67 protein levels (PND 60) compared to control. Combined prenatal and postnatal PCB exposure borderline decreased Ar expression (PND 8) compared to control. However, PCB exposure did not significantly affect the expression of Pgr, Esr1, and Esr2 or serum estradiol concentrations compared to control at any time point. In conclusion, these data suggest that PCB exposure affects follicle numbers and levels of the proliferation marker Ki67, but it does not affect expression of some sex steroid hormone receptors in the rat ovary.",PMC10528725

We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to November 17, 2022, for studies investigating the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and outcomes related to ASD. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023389386). We included 27 observational studies assessing prenatal exposure to phthalates (8 studies), polychlorinated biphenyls (8 studies), organophosphate pesticides (8 studies), phenols (7 studies), perfluoroalkyl substances (6 studies), organochlorine pesticides (5 studies), brominated flame retardants (3 studies), dioxins (1 study), and parabens (1 study). The number of examined children ranged from 77 to 1,556, the age at the assessment of autistic traits ranged from 3 to 14 years, and most studies assessed autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale. All but one study was considered to have a low risk of bias. Overall, there was no association between maternal exposure to specific ECDs during pregnancy and the occurrence of autistic traits in offspring. Findings from the epidemiological studies evaluated here do not support an association between prenatal exposure to ECDs and the likelihood of autistic traits in later in life. These findings should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of the absence of neurodevelopment effects of EDCs affecting ASD risk, given the limitations of current studies such as representative exposure assessment, small sample sizes, inadequacy to assess sexually dimorphic effects, or the effects of EDC mixtures. Future studies should carefully address these limitations.",PMC10289191

At entry and annually to age 19 years, physical examinations including testicular volume (TV) were performed and spot urines collected. Each boy's prepubertal urine samples were pooled, and 15 phthalate metabolites were quantified by isotope dilution LC-MS/MS at Moscow State University. Metabolites of anti-androgenic parent phthalates were included: butylbenzyl (BBzP), di-n-butyl (DnBP), diisobutyl (DiBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) (DEHP) and diisononyl (DiNP) phthalates. We calculated the molar sums of DEHP, DiNP, and all AAP metabolites. We used group-based trajectory models (GBTMs) to identify subgroups of boys who followed similar pubertal trajectories from ages 8-19 years based on annual TV. We used multinomial and ordinal regression models to evaluate whether prepubertal log-transformed phthalate metabolite concentrations were associated with slower or faster pubertal progression trajectories, adjusting for covariates. 304 boys contributed a total of 752 prepubertal urine samples (median 2, range: 1-6) for creation of individual pools. The median length of follow-up was 10.0 years; 79% of boys were followed beyond age 15. We identified three pubertal progression groups: slower (34%), moderate (43%), and faster (23%) progression. A standard deviation increase in urinary log-monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) concentrations was associated with higher adjusted odds of being in the slow versus faster pubertal progression trajectory (aOR 1.47, 95% CI 1.06-2.04). None of the other phthalate metabolites were associated with pubertal progression. On average, boys with higher concentrations of prepubertal urinary MBzP had a slower tempo of pubertal progression, perhaps attributable to the disruption of androgen-dependent biological pathways.",PMC10575624

The association of fetal and childhood levels of phthalates with pubertal development were explored. We conduct a population-based birth cohort study to investigate the association between prenatal and childhood exposure to phthalates and pubertal development. Initially, a total of 445 children were recruited from 2000 to 2001, of which 90 children were followed for 15 years which measurements of urine and development assessed at 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 years.

A logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratio of a higher Tanner stage at 14 years old. The Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression were used to estimate the association of testicular volume, uterine volume, ovarian volume, and blood hormones at 14 years of age with the log-transformed concentration of phthalates at 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 years. In boys, a significantly different geometric mean of mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) was observed in 11-year-olds; 6.82 and 2.96 in the lower Tanner stage group and higher Tanner stage group.

In this study, a strain belonging to Enterobacter sp. strain BHUBP7 was recovered from a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) situated in Varanasi city, U.P., India, and was capable of metabolizing both 17 α-Ethynylestradiol (EE2) and 17 β-Estradiol (E2) separately as a sole carbon source. The strain BHUBP7 exhibited high rates of E2 degradation as compared to EE2 degradation. The degradation of E2 (10 mg/L) was 94.3% after four days of incubation, whereas the degradation of EE2 (10 mg/L) under similar conditions was 98% after seven days of incubation. The kinetics of EE2 and E2 degradation fitted well with the first-order reaction rate. FTIR analysis revealed the involvement of functional groups like C = O, C-C, C-OH during the degradation process. The metabolites generated during degradation of EE2 and E2 were identified using HRAMS and a plausible pathway was elucidated. It was observed that metabolism of both E2 and EE2 proceeded with the formation of estrone, which was then hydroxylated to 4-hydroxy estrone, followed by ring opening at the C4-C5 position, and was further metabolized by the 4,5 seco pathway leading to the formation of 3-(7a-methyl-1,5-dioxooctahydro-1H-inden-4-yl) propanoic acid (HIP). It is the first report on the complete pathway of EE2 and E2 degradation in Enterobacter sp. strain BHUBP7.

The in vitro H295R steroidogenesis assay (OECD TG 456) is commonly used to test for this modality. However, current detection methods often fail to capture alterations to estrogen biosynthesis. The present study explored the potential of ERα and AR CALUX bioassays to serve as a detection system for the original H295R assay, as they can quantify lower hormone concentrations and can simultaneously provide information about estrogen- and androgen-receptor activities. Using substances from the original OECD validation study, we obtained lowest observed effect concentrations for steroidogenesis mostly equivalent to those previously reported and sometimes lower for estrogen biosynthesis. However, categorization of many of these substances as receptor (ant)agonists or disruptors of steroidogenesis was difficult because often substances had both modalities, including some where the receptor-mediated activities were identified at concentrations below those triggering steroidogenic effects. When the leading activity was not accounted for, H295R-CALUX assay sensitivity in comparison to the OECD validation study was 0.50 for androgen and 0.78 for estrogen biosynthesis. However, upon reinterpretation of the combined assay results to identify endocrine activities without regard to the modality or direction of effects, assay sensitivity was equal to 1.00. These proof-of-concept study findings indicate the high relevance of this assay for the identification of endocrine active substances with additional valuable mode-of-action information and the capacity to detect smaller changes in estrogen biosynthesis, suggesting that the coupled H295R-CALUX assay has promise for the analysis of samples in a decision-making context.",PMC10375316

Among the EDCs of environmental concern, 17β-estradiol (E2) can produce the strongest estrogenic effects when it enters the organism exogenously through various routes and has the potential to cause harm, including malfunctions of the endocrine system and development of growth and reproductive disorders in humans and animals. Additionally, in humans, supraphysiological levels of E2 have been associated with a range of E2-dependent disorders and cancers. To ensure environmental safety and prevent potential risks of E2 to human and animal health, it is crucial to develop rapid, sensitive, low cost and simple approaches for detecting E2 contamination in the environment. A planar microwave sensor for E2 sensing is presented based on the integration of a microstrip transmission line (TL) loaded with a Peano fractal geometry with a narrow slot complementary split-ring resonator (PF-NSCSRR) and a microfluidic channel. The proposed technique offers a wide linear range for detecting E2, ranging from 0.001 to 10 mM, and can achieve high sensitivity with small sample volumes and simple operation methods. The proposed microwave sensor was validated through simulations and empirical measurements within a frequency range of 0.5-3.5 GHz. The E2 solution was delivered to the sensitive area of the sensor device via a microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channel with an area of 2.7 mm2 and sample value of 1.37 µL and measured by a proposed sensor. The injection of E2 into the channel resulted in changes in the transmission coefficient (S21) and resonance frequency (Fr), which can be used as an indicator of E2 levels in solution. The maximum quality factor of 114.89 and the maximum sensitivity based on S21 and Fr at a concentration of 0.01 mM were 1746.98 dB/mM and 40 GHz/mM, respectively. Upon comparing the proposed sensor with the original Peano fractal geometry with complementary split-ring (PF-CSRR) sensors without a narrow slot, several parameters were evaluated, including sensitivity, quality factor, operating frequency, active area, and sample volume. The results showed that the proposed sensor exhibited an increased sensitivity of 6.08% and had a 40.72% higher quality factor, while the operating frequency, active area, and sample volume showed decreases of 1.71%, 25%, and 28.27%, respectively. The materials under tests (MUTs) were analyzed and categorized into groups using principal component analysis (PCA) with a K-mean clustering algorithm. The proposed E2 sensor has a compact size and simple structure that can be easily fabricated with low-cost materials. With the small sample volume requirement, fast measurement with a wide dynamic range, and a simple protocol, this proposed sensor can also be applied to measure high E2 levels in environmental, human, and animal samples.",PMC10216718

Here, we described a biomimetic placental barrier model from human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) in a perfused organ chip system. The placental barrier was constructed by co-culture of hTSCs and endothelial cells on the opposite sides of a collagen-coated membrane on chip. hTSCs can differentiate into cytotrophoblasts (CT) and syncytiotrophoblast (ST), which self-assembled into bilayered trophoblastic epithelium with placental microvilli-like structure under dynamic cultures. The formed placental barrier displayed dense microvilli, higher level secretion of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), enhanced glucose transport activity.

Residential histories for each man were constructed using locations from administrative records linked through the Utah Population Database. Industrial facilities with air emissions of nine endocrine-disrupting compound chemical classes were identified from the Environmental Protection Agency Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators microdata. Chemical levels were linked with residential histories for the 5 years before each semen analysis. Semen analyses were classified as azoospermic or oligozoospermic (< 15 M/mL) using World Health Organization cutoffs for concentration.

We previously demonstrated that BPF exposure increased body growth and adiposity in male N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats, a genetically heterogeneous outbred population. We hypothesize that the founder strains of the HS rat exhibit EDC effects that were strain- and sex-dependent.

Body weight and fluid intake were measured weekly, metabolic parameters were assessed, and blood and tissues were collected. BPF increased thyroid weight in ACI males, thymus and kidney weight in BUF females, adrenal weight in WKY males, and possibly increased pituitary weight in BN males. BUF females also developed a disruption in activity and metabolic rate with BPF exposure. These sex- and strain-specific exposure outcomes illustrate that HS rat founders possess diverse bisphenol-exposure risk alleles and suggest that BPF exposure may intensify inherent organ system dysfunction existing in the HS rat founders.

Additionally, quantile g-computation was utilized to assess the effect of the phthalate mixture on GAA at birth and IEAA throughout childhood. We found a negative association between prenatal di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) exposure and IEAA among males at age 7 (-0.62 years; 95% CI:-1.06 to -0.18), and a marginal negative association between the whole phthalate mixture and GAA among males at birth (-1.54 days, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.28), while most other associations were nonsignificant. Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to certain phthalates is associated with epigenetic aging in children. Additionally, our findings suggest that the influence of prenatal exposures on epigenetic age may only manifest during specific periods of child development, and studies relying on DNAm measurements solely from cord blood or single time points may overlook potential relationships.",PMC10330458

Despite being banned in 1979 due to human health concerns, they persist in the environment. In humans and experimental model systems, PCBs elicit toxicity in part by acting as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Aroclor 1221 (A1221) is a weakly estrogenic PCB mixture known to alter reproductive function in rodents. EDCs can impact hormone signaling at any level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and we investigated the effects of A1221 exposure during the prenatal and postnatal developmental periods on pituitary hormone and steroid receptor expression in female rats. Examining offspring at 3 ages, postnatal day 8 (P8), P32 and P60, we found that prenatal exposure to A1221 increased P8 neonate pituitary luteinizing hormone beta (Lhb) mRNA and LHβ gonadotrope cell number while decreasing LH serum hormone concentration. No changes in pituitary hormone or hormone receptor gene expression were observed peri-puberty at P32. In reproductively mature rats at P60, we found pituitary follicle stimulating hormone beta (Fshb) mRNA levels increased by prenatal A1221 exposure with no corresponding alterations in FSH hormone or FSHβ expressing cell number. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) mRNA and protein levels were also increased at P60, but only following postnatal A1221 dosing. Together, these data illustrate that exposure to the PCB A1221, during critical developmental windows, alters pituitary gonadotropin hormone subunits and ERα levels in offspring at different phases of maturation, potentially impacting reproductive function in concert with other components of the HPG axis.",PMC10228234

Here, we sought to examine maternal and fetal gene expression differences of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-regulated genes in a mouse model of prenatal PCB126 exposure. Female mice were bred and gavaged with 1 µmole/kg bodyweight PCB126 or vehicle control on embryonic days 0 and 14, and maternal and fetal tissues were collected on embryonic day 18.5. Total RNAs were isolated, and gene expression levels were analyzed in both maternal and fetal tissues using the NanoString nCounter system. Interestingly, we found that the expression levels of cytochrome P450 (Cyp)1a1 and Cyp1b1 were significantly increased in response to PCB exposure in the tested maternal and fetal tissues. Furthermore, PCB exposure altered the expression of several other genes related to energy balance, oxidative stress, and epigenetic regulation in a manner that was less consistent across tissue types. These results indicate that maternal PCB126 exposure significantly alters gene expression in both developing fetuses and pregnant dams, and such changes vary in intensity and expressivity depending on tissue type.

Accumulating evidence suggests that steroid synthesis inhibitors such as ketoconazole (KTZ) or phthalates may also affect female reproductive health, however their mode of action is poorly understood. Because hypothalamic activity is very sensitive to sex steroids, we aimed at determining whether and how EDCs with different mode of action can alter the hypothalamic transcriptome and GnRH release in female rats. Female rats were exposed to KTZ or DES during perinatal (DES 3-6-12μg/kg.d; KTZ 3-6-12mg/kg.d), pubertal or adult periods (DES 3-12-48μg/kg.d; KTZ 3-12-48mg/kg.d). Ex vivo study of GnRH pulsatility revealed that perinatal exposure to the highest doses of KTZ and DES delayed maturation of GnRH secretion before puberty, whereas pubertal or adult exposure had no effect on GnRH pulsatility. Hypothalamic transcriptome, studied by RNAsequencing in the preoptic area and in the mediobasal hypothalamus, was found to be very sensitive to perinatal exposure to all doses of KTZ before puberty with effects persisting until adulthood. Bioinformatic analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis predicted ""Creb signaling in Neurons"" and ""IGF-1 signaling"" among the most downregulated pathways by all doses of KTZ and DES before puberty, and ""PPARg"" as a common upstream regulator driving gene expression changes. Deeper screening ofRNAseq datasets indicated that a high number of genes regulating the activity of the extrinsic GnRH pulse generator were consistently affected by all the doses of DES and KTZ before puberty. Several, including MKRN3, DNMT3 or Cbx7, showed similar alterations in expression at adulthood. nRH secretion and the hypothalamic transcriptome are highly sensitive to perinatal exposure to both DES and KTZ.

To address challenges associated with traditional testing strategies, EDSP is considering in vitro high-throughput screening assays to screen and prioritize chemicals more efficiently. The ability of these assays to accurately reflect chemical interactions in nonmammalian species remains uncertain. Therefore, a goal of the EDSP is to evaluate how broadly results can be extrapolated across taxa. To assess the cross-species conservation of AR-modulated pathways, computational analyses and systematic literature review approaches were used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing in silico, in vitro, and in vivo data. First, molecular target conservation was assessed across 585 diverse species based on the structural similarity of ARs. These results indicate that ARs are conserved across vertebrates and are predicted to share similarly susceptibility to chemicals that interact with the human AR. Systematic analysis of over 5000 published manuscripts was used to compile in vitro and in vivo cross-species toxicity data. Assessment of in vitro data indicates conservation of responses occurs across vertebrate ARs, with potential differences in sensitivity. Similarly, in vivo data indicate strong conservation of the AR signaling pathways across vertebrate species, although sensitivity may vary. Overall, this study demonstrates a framework for utilizing bioinformatics and existing data to build weight of evidence for cross-species extrapolation and provides a technical basis for extrapolating hAR-based data to prioritize hazard in nonmammalian vertebrate species.",PMC10796108

There is considerable interest in studying the conserved design principles and functions of reproductive TRNs given that their intricate regulation is susceptible to disruption by gene mutations or exposures to exogenous endocrine disrupting chemicals (or EDCs). In this manuscript, the Boolean rules describing reproductive TRNs in humans, mice, and zebrafish, were represented as a pseudo-stoichiometric matrix model. This model mathematically described the interactions of 35 transcription factors with 21 sex determination and differentiation genes across the three species. The in silico approach of Extreme Pathway (ExPa) analysis was used to predict the extent of TRN gene activations subject to the species-specific transcriptomics data, from across various developmental life-stages. A goal of this work was to identify conserved and functional reproductive TRNs across the three species. ExPa analyses predicted the sex differentiation genes, DHH, DMRT1, and AR, to be highly active in male humans, mice, and zebrafish. Whereas FOXL2 was the most active gene in female humans and mice; and CYP19A1A in female zebrafish. These results agree with the expectation that regardless of a lack of sex determination genes in zebrafish, the TRNs responsible for canalizing male vs. female sexual differentiation are conserved with mammalian taxa. ExPa analysis therefore provides a framework with which to study the TRNs that influence the development of sexual phenotypes. And the in silico predicted conservation of sex differentiation TRNs between mammals and zebrafish identifies the piscine species as an effective in vivo model to study mammalian reproductive systems under normal or perturbed pathologies.",PMC10461611

Exposure of pregnant mice to NSAID therapeutic doses during the sex determination period has a negative impact on gonadal development and fertility in adults; however, the effects of their chronic exposure at lower doses are unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of chronic exposure to a mixture containing ibuprofen, 2hydroxy-ibuprofen, diclofenac, and EE2 at two environmentally relevant doses (added to the drinking water from fetal life until puberty) on the reproductive tract in F1 exposed mice and their F2 offspring. In F1 animals, exposure delayed male puberty and accelerated female puberty. In post-pubertal F1 testes and ovaries, differentiation/maturation of the different gonad cell types was altered, and some of these modifications were observed also in the non-exposed F2 generation. Transcriptomic analysis of post-pubertal testes and ovaries of F1 (exposed) and F2 animals revealed significant changes in gene expression profiles and enriched pathways, particularly the inflammasome, metabolism and extracellular matrix pathways, compared with controls (non-exposed). This suggested that exposure to these drug cocktails has an intergenerational impact.

We constructed generalized estimating equations to examine BPA and BPS exposure jointly at each trimester for each atopy phenotype. BPA was modeled as a log-transformed continuous variable, whereas BPS was modeled as detected versus not detected. We also modeled pregnancy-averaged BPA values and a categorical indicator for number of detectable BPS values over pregnancy (0-3) in logistic regression models. First trimester BPA was associated with inverse odds of food allergy among the entire study sample (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.64-0.95, p = 0.01) and females only (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.52-0.90, p = 0.006).

The determination of the level of E2 is thus very crucial in both wastewater treatment and in the aspect of environmental pollution management. In this work, an inherent and strong affinity of the estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) for E2 was used as a basis for the development of a biosensor that was highly selective towards E2 determination. A gold disk electrode (AuE) was functionalised with a 3-mercaptopropionic acid-capped tin selenide (SnSe-3MPA) quantum dot to produce a SnSe-3MPA/AuE electroactive sensor platform. The ER-α-based biosensor (ER-α/SnSe-3MPA/AuE) for E2 was produced by the amide chemistry of carboxyl functional groups of SnSe-3MPA quantum dots and the primary amines of ER-α.

Our recent studies have shown that prenatal BPA exposure disrupted ASD-related gene expression in the hippocampus, neurological functions, and behaviors associated with ASD in a sex-specific pattern. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of BPA are still unclear. Transcriptome data mining and molecular docking analyses were performed to identify ASD-related transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes underlying the sex-specific effects of prenatal BPA exposure. Gene ontology analysis was conducted to predict biological functions associated with these genes. The expression levels of ASD-related TFs and targets in the hippocampus of rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA were measured using qRT-PCR analysis. The role of the androgen receptor (AR) in BPA-mediated regulation of ASD candidate genes was investigated using a human neuronal cell line stably transfected with AR-expression or control plasmid. Synaptogenesis, which is a function associated with genes transcriptionally regulated by ASD-related TFs, was assessed using primary hippocampal neurons isolated from male and female rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA. We found that there was a sex difference in ASD-related TFs underlying the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the transcriptome profiles of the offspring hippocampus. In addition to the known BPA targets AR and ESR1, BPA could directly interact with novel targets (i.e., KDM5B, SMAD4, and TCF7L2). The targets of these TFs were also associated with ASD. Prenatal BPA exposure disrupted the expression of ASD-related TFs and targets in the offspring hippocampus in a sex-dependent manner. Moreover, AR was involved in the BPA-mediated dysregulation of AUTS2, KMT2C, and SMARCC2. Prenatal BPA exposure altered synaptogenesis by increasing synaptic protein levels in males but not in females, but the number of excitatory synapses was increased in female primary neurons only. Our findings suggest that AR and other ASD-related TFs are involved in sex differences in the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on transcriptome profiles and synaptogenesis in the offspring hippocampus. These TFs may play an essential role in an increased ASD susceptibility associated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals, particularly BPA, and the male bias of ASD.",PMC9940328

DDT has been shown to disrupt secretory and morphogenetic processes in the adrenal cortex. The present investigation aimed to evaluate transcriptional regulation of postnatal growth of the adrenal medulla and formation of the pools necessary for self-renewal of medullary cells in rats that developed under low-dose exposure to DDT. The study was performed using male Wistar rats exposed to low doses of o,p'-DDT during prenatal and postnatal development. Light microscopy and histomorphometry revealed diminished medulla growth in the DDT-exposed rats. Evaluation of Ki-67 expression in chromaffin cells found later activation of proliferation indicative of retarded growth of the adrenal medulla. All DDT-exposed rats exhibited a gradual decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase production by adrenal chromaffin cells. Immunohistochemical evaluation of nuclear β-catenin, transcription factor Oct4, and ligand of sonic hedgehog revealed increased expression of all factors after termination of growth in the control rats. The DDT-exposed rats demonstrated diminished increases in Oct4 and sonic hedgehog expression and lower levels of canonical Wnt signaling activation. Thus, developmental exposure to the endocrine disruptor o,p'-DDT alters the transcriptional regulation of morphogenetic processes in the adrenal medulla and evokes a slowdown in its growth and in the formation of a reserve pool of cells capable of dedifferentiation and proliferation that maintain cellular homeostasis in adult adrenals.",PMC9917778

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals is correlated with increased diabetes incidence. We hypothesized that treatment with bisphenol A (BPA) induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to impaired function of the β-cells, which over time, can cause diabetes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate UPR pathways activation under BPA treatment in β-cells and possible recovery of ER homeostasis. MIN6 cells (mouse insulinoma cell line) and isolated pancreatic islets from NOR (non-obese diabetes resistant) mice were treated with BPA. We analyzed the impact of BPA on β-cell viability, the architecture of the early secretory pathway, the synthesis and processing of insulin and the activation of UPR sensors and effectors. We found that the addition of the chemical chaperone TUDCA rescues the deleterious effects of BPA, resulting in improved viability, morphology and function of the β-cells. In conclusion, we propose that modulators of UPR can be used as therapeutic interventions targeted towards regaining β-cells homeostasis.",PMC9916570

This study evaluated pregnancy duration and birthweight (BW) variations in the children and grandchildren born before, during, and after maternal DES treatment in the same informative families, to rule out genetic, endocrine, and environmental factors. Nationwide retrospective observational study on 529 families of DES-treated women registered at the HHORAGES-France Association. The inclusion criteria were: (i) women with at least three pregnancies and three viable children among whom the first was not exposed in utero to DES, followed by one or more children with fetal exposure to DES, and then by one or more children born after DES treatment; (ii) women with at least one pre-DES or post-DES grandchild and one DES grandchild; (iii) confirmed data on total DES dose. Women with severe pathologies or whose illness status, habitat, lifestyle habits, profession, treatment changed between pregnancies, and all mothers who reported pregnancy-related problems, were excluded. In all, 74 women met all criteria. The preterm birth (PTB) rate was 2.7% in pre-DES, 14.9% in DES, and 10.8% in post-DES children (Cochran-Armitage test for trend, p = 0.0095). The mean BW was higher in DES than pre-DES full-term neonates (≥37 weeks of gestation) (p = 0.007). In grandchildren, BW was not different, whereas the PTB and low BW rates were slightly increased in children of DES women. These data within the same informative families show the DES impact on BW and PTB in DES and post-DES children and grandchildren. In particular, mean BW was higher in DES than pre-DES full-term neonates. This result may be in opposition to previous data from American cohorts, which reported lower BW in DES children, but is consistent with animal study.

Although the positive energy balance is one of the most significant causes of obesity, recent research has linked early exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) such as the obesogen tributyltin (TBT) to the disease epidemic. In addition to their actions on the hormonal profile, EDCs can induce long-term changes in gene expression, possibly due to changes in epigenetic patterns. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are epigenetic mediators that play important regulatory roles in several biological processes, through regulation of gene transcription and/or translation. In this study, we explored the differential expression of lncRNAs in gonadal white adipose tissue samples from adult male C57BL/6J F4 generation, female C57BL/6J offspring exposed (F0 generation) to 50 nM TBT or 0.1% DMSO (control of vehicle) via drinking water provided during pregnancy and lactation, analyzing RNA-seq data from a publicly available dataset (GSE105051). A total of 74 lncRNAs were differentially expressed (DE), 22 were up-regulated and 52 were down-regulated in the group whose F4 ancestor was exposed in utero to 50nM TBT when compared to those exposed to 0.1% DMSO (control). Regulation of DE lncRNAs and their potential partner genes in gonadal white adipose tissue of mice ancestrally exposed to EDC TBT may be related to the control of adipogenesis, as pathway enrichment analyses showed that these gene partners are mainly involved in the metabolism of lipids and glucose and in insulin-related pathways, which are essential for obesity onset and control.",PMC10045570

However, no studies focused on the common spectrum of environmental VOCs exposure affecting sex hormones in the average male population. We aimed to explore the association between VOCs and sex hormones in American adult males using multiple statistical models. The generalized linear (GLM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), weighted quantile sum (WQS), Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and stratified models were used to evaluate the associations between Specific Volatile Organic Compounds and sex hormones in American adult male from NHANES 2013-2016. Pearson correlation model revealed the potential co-exposure pattern among VOCs. XGBoost algorithm models and the WQS model suggested the relative importance of VOCs. BKMR models reveal that co-exposure to the VOCs was associated with increased Testosterone (TT), Estradiol (E2), SHBG and decreased TT/E2. GLM models revealed specific VOC exposure as an independent risk factor causing male sex hormones disorders. Stratified analysis identified the high-risk group on the VOCs exposures.

DEHP exposure was associated with altered hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function. Although previous studies reported deleterious effects of DEHP exposure during the intrauterine period, few studies have evaluated the direct effects triggered by this endocrine disruptor on the offspring animals' thyroid function. This study aimed to investigate the impact of intrauterine exposure to DEHP on the HPT axis function programming of the offspring animals during adulthood. Pregnant Wistar rats were orally treated with corn oil or corn oil supplemented with DEHP (0.48 or 4.8 mg/kg/day) throughout the gestational period. The offspring rats were euthanized on the 90th postnatal day. Hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, and liver were collected to analyze gene expression and protein content through qPCR and Western Blot. Blood was collected to determine TSH and thyroid hormone levels through fluorometric or chemiluminescence immunoassays. In the adult F1 female rats, the highest dose of DEHP decreased TSH serum levels. In the thyroid, DEHP reduced the gene expression and/or protein content of NIS, TSHR, TG, TPO, MCT8, NKX2.1, PAX8, and FOXE1. These data are consistent with the reduction in T4 serum levels of the F1 DEHP-exposed female rats. In the liver, DEHP exposure increased the mRNA expression of Dio1 and Ttr, while the highest dose of DEHP reduced the mRNA expression of Ugt1a1 and Ugt1a6. Conversely, in the F1 male adult rats, TSHB expression and TSH serum levels were increased in DEHP-exposed animals. In the thyroid, except for the reduced protein content of TSHR, none of the evaluated genes/proteins were altered by DEHP. TH serum levels were not changed in the DEHP-exposed F1 male rats compared to the control group. Additionally, there were no significant alterations in the expression of hepatic enzymes in these animals. Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that intrauterine exposure to DEHP disrupts the HPT axis function in male and female offspring rats and strongly suggest that DEHP exposure increases the susceptibility of the offspring animals to develop thyroid dysfunctions during adulthood.",PMC9880230

Although human exposure is widespread there is a limited number of epidemiological studies assessing the relationship between exposure to these chemicals and female reproductive health. The aim of the study is to explore the relationship between paraben and benzophenone concentrations and reproductive outcomes among women attending a fertility center. This prospective cohort included 450 women undergoing in vitro treatment (IVF) at fertility clinic in Poland. The validated gas chromatography ion-tap mass spectrometry to assess concentrations of parabens in urine (methyl (MP), ethyl (EP), propyl (PP), butyl paraben (BP)) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) was used. To explore the relationship between concentrations of examined chemicals and reproductive outcomes (methaphase II (MII) oocyte yield, total oocyte yield, implantation rate, fertilization rate, clinical pregnancy, live births), multivariable generalized linear mixed model was used for the analysis. Increased exposure to butyl paraben was associated with a significant decrease in MII oocyte count (p = 0.007) when exposure to BP was treated as the continuous variable. Additionally, the exposure to BP in the highest quartile of exposure also decreases MII oocyte count (p = 0.02) compared to the lowest quartile. Urinary concentrations of BP were not related to total oocyte count, fertilization and implantation rate, clinical pregnancy, and live birth when the exposure variable was continuous variable or in the quartiles of exposure. Exposure to MP, EP, PP, the sum of examined parabens, and benzophenone-3 were not related to any of the examined reproductive outcomes. Exposure to butyl paraben was associated with a decrease in MII oocyte count among women attending fertility clinic rinsing concerns that exposure may have a potential adverse impact on embryological outcomes. The results emphasize the importance to reduce chemicals in the environment in order to minimize exposure. As this is the first study showing such an association, further research is needed to confirm these novel results in other populations.",PMC10076394

In previous studies, we found that in utero exposure to mixtures of the plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and the soy-based phytoestrogen genistein (Gen) induced abnormal testis development in rats. In the present study, we investigated the molecular basis of these effects in adult testes from the offspring of pregnant SD rats gavaged with corn oil or Gen + DEHP mixtures at 0.1 or 10 mg/kg/day. Testicular transcriptomes were determined by microarray and RNA-seq analyses. A protein analysis was performed on paraffin and frozen testis sections, mainly by immunofluorescence. The transcription factor forkhead box protein 3 (FOXA3), a key regulator of Leydig cell function, was identified as the most significantly downregulated gene in testes from rats exposed in utero to Gen + DEHP mixtures. FOXA3 protein levels were decreased in testicular interstitium at a dose previously found to reduce testosterone levels, suggesting a primary effect of fetal exposure to Gen + DEHP on adult Leydig cells, rather than on spermatids and Sertoli cells, also expressing FOXA3.

However, unintended or unregulated distribution and exposure to even significant low levels of 17β-estradiol estrogen have detrimental health implication that can lead to reproductive abnormalities and even cancer. This could have severe effect on the ecosystem imbalance, food safety, to such a degree that its health impact necessitates rapid methods to probe for its prevalence and occurrence in the environment. Herein a simple, robust, sensitive and once-off use electrochemical biosensor to detect 17β-estradiol is developed, using 3-mercaptopropionic acid capped zinc selenide quantum dots trapped within the polyaniline (PANI) framework structure. The biosensor's interaction with the substrate was based on the capability of the hemeprotein, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme (i.e., baroreceptor) to alternatively catalyze phenolic alcohols. The biosensor displayed a significantly low limit of detection limit (LOD) of value 0.2 × 10-6 M towards 17β-estradiol. The Mechaelis-Menten constant (Km) with the magnitude of 0.64 × 10-6 M was obtained; this indicates an outstanding affinity of the biosensing films towards 17β-estradiol. Subsequently, the developed biosensor was able to accurately and efficiently measure successive concentrations of 17β-estradiol from 0.2 × 10 to 4 × 10-6 M. The fabricated biosensor showed good selectivity towards 17β-estradiol compared to the other estrogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds such as estrone (E1), ethnylstradiol (EE2), and estriol (E3).

Anogenital distance (AGD) is an anthropomorphic measure of antenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors, with higher exposure levels leading to shortened AGD. We hypothesized that exposure to endocrine disruptors could lead to changes in DNA methylation during early embryonic development, which could then persist in the sperm of infertile men with shortened AGD. Using fluorescence activated cell sorting based on staining with either YO-PRO-1 (YOPRO) or chromomycin-3 (CMA3), we isolated four sperm fractions from eleven infertile men with short AGD and ten healthy semen donors. We examined DNA methylation in these sorted spermatozoa using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. We found that fractions of spermatozoa from infertile men stained with CMA3 or YOPRO were more likely to contain transposable elements harboring an estrogen receptor response element (ERE). Abnormal sperm (as judged by high CMA3 or YOPRO staining) from infertile men shows substantial hypomethylation in estrogenic Alu sequences. Conversely, normal sperm fractions (as judged by low CMA3 or YO-PRO-1 staining) of either healthy donors or infertile patients were more likely to contain hypermethylated Alu sequences with ERE.

Estrone (E1) and atrazine (ATR) are common environmental contaminants often associated with agricultural land use. 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a contaminant associated with wastewater treatment effluent, and a representative, well-studied estrogen commonly used for fish toxicity testing. Our objective was to assess whether early gonad recrudescence in adult fish was a period of sensitivity for alterations in reproductive condition and function. Adult male LMB were exposed from post-spawning to early gonad recrudescence to either a mixture of E1 (47.9 ng/L) + ATR (5.4 µg/L), or EE2 (2.4 ng/L) in outdoor experimental ponds. Gonad samples were collected from fish just prior to the start of exposure (July), at the end of the exposure period (December), the following spring just prior to spawning (April), and post spawning (May). Gonadosomatic index (GSI) was significantly reduced in E1 + ATR-exposed and EE2-exposed males compared to control at every post-exposure time point. Reduced sperm count and sperm motility were observed in the mixture treatment (E1 + ATR) compared to the control. Sperm motility was also reduced in the EE2 treatment. These data together indicate that estrogenic endocrine-disrupting compounds can lessen the reproductive condition of adult male LMB, and that effects of exposure during early gonad recrudescence can persist at least through the subsequent spawning cycle.",PMC9785829

An electrochemical biosensor for rapid detection of E2 in water samples was successfully developed. The biosensor was based on split DNA aptamers attached onto poly (methacrylic acid-co-n butyl acrylate-succinimide) microspheres deposited on polypyrrole nanowires coated electrode (PPY/PMAA-NBA). The sandwich paired of split DNA aptamers used were truncated from 75 mer parent aptamers. These two strands of 12-mer and 14-mer split DNA aptamers were then immobilized on the PMAA-NBA microspheres. In the presence of E2, the split DNA aptamers formed an apt12-E2-apt14 complex, where the binding reaction on the electrode surface led to the detection of E2 by differential pulse voltammetry using ferrocyanide as a redox indicator. Under optimum conditions, the aptasensor detected E2 concentrations in the range of 1 × 10-4 M to 1 × 10-12 M (R2 = 0.9772) with a detection limit of 4.8 × 10-13 M. E2, which were successfully measured in a real sample with 97-104% recovery and showed a good correlation (R2 = 0.9999) with the established method, such as high-performance liquid chromatography.

They can cause health problems in living organisms due to their bioaccumulation potential. It is, therefore, unknown whether endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), in particular estrogens, are capable of adhering to the diverse types of MPs found in water. Two MP polymers (low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyethene terephthalate (PET)) that could pose a threat to fish were tested for estrogen adsorption. The adsorption capacity of MP pellets was studied for 30 days in the effluent and influent of a wastewater treatment-plant. A laboratory simulation was conducted to validate the field and laboratory findings. We found that the concentrations of five types of estrogen ((diethylstilbestrol (DES), estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2)) were higher in the influent than the effluent streams. LDPE and PET MPs exposed to influent water in the laboratory had higher estrogen levels than wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) pellets.

Here we examine changes in the rate of postnatal apoptosis in the rat prefrontal cortex and its timing with brief BPA exposure. Because an increased number of neurons in the PFC is a characteristic of a subtype of autism spectrum disorder, we tested social preference following brief BPA exposure and also expression of a small group of genes. Males and females were exposed to BPA from postnatal days (P) 6 through 8 or from P10 through 12. Both exposures significantly decreased indicators of cell death in the developing medial prefrontal cortex in male subjects only. Additionally, males exposed to BPA from P6 - 8 showed decreased social preference and decreased cortical expression of Shank3 and Homer1, two synaptic scaffolding genes that have been implicated in social deficits. There were no significant effects of BPA in the female subjects. These results draw attention to the negative consequences following brief exposure to BPA during early development.",PMC9839503

Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), such as bisphenol A (BPA), are environmental toxicants that are known to negatively impact reproductive functions. As such, the use of BPA in the manufacturing industry has slowly been replaced by analogs, including bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF), despite limited knowledge available regarding their impact on health and their safety. The following study investigates the effects of BPA, BPS and BPF at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL on bovine granulosa cell apoptosis, with the ultimate goal of determining how they may impact oocyte competence and, thus, overall fertility. The underlying hypothesis is that bisphenols disrupt the granulosa cell environment surrounding the oocyte inducing excessive apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. To test this hypothesis, apoptosis was measured following a time- and dose-dependent exposure to all three bisphenols by flowcytometry paired with annexin V/PI staining as well as by quantification of key genes belonging to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway both at the mRNA and protein levels. The results of this study report that BPA and BPF reduce cell viability through reduced cell counts and increased apoptosis. This increase is due, in part, to the induction of apoptotic genes of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Additionally, this study also suggests that BPS may not act on the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in bovine granulosa cells. Overall, this study allows us to establish potential apoptotic pathways activated by bisphenols as well as compare the relative apoptotic activities of BPA to its most widespread analogs.",PMC9650025

It is a substance with an endocrine-disrupting capacity, causing alterations in the reproductive, immunological, and neurological systems, among others, as well as metabolic alterations. Our study aimed to assess its clinical signs, and effects on the most relevant blood biochemical parameters, and to evaluate pituitary and gonadal histology after a chronic exposure of adult mice to different BPA doses (0.5, 2, 4, 50 and 100 µg/kg BW/day) through their drinking water. The biochemical results showed that a marked significant reduction (p < 0.05) was produced in the levels of serum glucose, hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminemia in the groups exposed to the highest doses, whereas in the group exposed to 50 µg/kg BW/day the glucose and total protein levels dropped, and the animals exposed to 100 µg/kg BW/day experienced a diminution in albumin levels. In the case of the group exposed to 50 µg/kg BW/day, however, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia were determined, and the blood parameters indicating kidney alterations such as urea and creatinine experienced a significant increase (p < 0.05) with respect to the controls. Regarding the pituitary and gonads, none of the animals exposed presented histological alterations at the doses tested, giving similar images to those of the control group. These results suggest that continuous exposure to low BPA doses could trigger an inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which would result in a hypoglycaemic state, together with an induction of the enzymes responsible for lipidic synthesis, a mechanism by which the increase in the lipid and serum cholesterol levels could be explained. Likewise, the decline in the protein and albumin levels would be indicative of a possible hepatic alteration, and the increase in urea and creatinine would point to a possible renal perturbation, derived from continuous exposure to this xenobiotic. Based on our results, it could be said that chronic exposure to low BPA doses would not produce any clinical signs or histological pituitary-gonadal effects, but it could cause modifications in some blood biochemical parameters, that could initially indicate a possible hepatic and renal effect.",PMC9659152

This amperometric sensor was then modified to detect an endocrine disruptor. The incorporation of a protein switch into the synthetic pathway and encapsulation of the bacteria with conductive nanomaterials enabled the detection of the endocrine disruptor in urban waterway samples within 3 min.

In humans, exposure to brominated flame retardants (BFR) or other environmentally persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and novel organophosphate flame retardants has been associated with increasing trends of diabetes and metabolic disease. However, the effects of PBDEs on metabolic processes and their associated sex-dependent features are poorly understood. The metabolic-disrupting effects of perinatal exposure to industrial penta-PBDE mixture, DE-71, on male and female progeny of C57BL/6N mouse dams were examined in adulthood. Dams were exposed to environmentally relevant doses of PBDEs daily for 10 weeks (p.o.): 0.1 (L-DE-71) and 0.4 mg/kg/d (H-DE-71) and offspring parameters were compared to corn oil vehicle controls (VEH/CON). The following lipid metabolism indices were measured: plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, leptin, and liver lipids. L-DE-71 female offspring were particularly affected, showing hypercholesterolemia, elevated liver lipids and fasting plasma leptin as compared to same-sex VEH/CON, while L- and H-DE-71 male F1 only showed reduced plasma adiponectin. Using the quantitative Folch method, we found that mean liver lipid content was significantly elevated in L-DE-71 female offspring compared to controls. Oil Red O staining revealed fatty liver in female offspring and dams. General measures of adiposity, body weight, white and brown adipose tissue (BAT), and lean and fat mass were weighed or measured using EchoMRI. DE-71 did not produce abnormal adiposity, but decreased BAT depots in L-DE-71 females and males relative to same-sex VEH/CON. To begin to address potential central mechanisms of deregulated lipid metabolism, we used RT-qPCR to quantitate expression of hypothalamic genes in energy-regulating circuits that control lipid homeostasis. Both doses of DE-71 sex-dependently downregulated hypothalamic expression of Lepr, Stat3, Mc4r, Agrp, Gshr in female offspring while H-DE-71 downregulated Npy in exposed females relative to VEH/CON. In contrast, exposed male offspring displayed upregulated Stat3 and Mc4r. Intestinal barrier integrity was measured using FITC-dextran since it can lead to systemic inflammation that leads to liver damage and metabolic disease, but was not affected by DE-71 exposure.

We previously showed that perinatal exposure to Aroclor 1254, a commercial mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) associated with alterations of cognitive function in children, disrupted the normal maturation of excitatory synapses in the dentate gyrus. We hypothesized that hippocampal immature neurons underlie some of the cognitive effects of PCBs. We used newly generated neurons to examine the effects of PCBs in mice following maternal exposure. Newborn dentate granule cells were tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein using a transgenic mouse line. The transcriptome of the newly generated granule cells was assessed using RNA sequencing. Gestational and lactational exposure to 6 mg/kg/day of Aroclor 1254 disrupted the mRNA expression of 1,308 genes in newborn granule cells. Genes involved in mitochondrial functions were highly enriched with 154 genes significantly increased in exposed compared to control mice. The upregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation was accompanied by signs of endoplasmic reticulum stress and an increase in lipid peroxidation, a marker of oxidative stress, in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus but not in mature granule cells in the granular zone. Aroclor 1254 exposure also disrupted the expression of synaptic genes. Using laser-captured subgranular and granular zones, this effect was restricted to the subgranular zone, where newborn neurons are located.

Methods: After having filled in the digital questionnaire in HP waiting rooms, patients were invited to talk about ED exposure during the consultation. HPs were previously trained in ED and had received a prevention kit for their patients. After the seven-month implementation phase, the evaluation phase consisted of five mixed assessments: interviews with: (i) patients who were young children's parents; (ii) patients in the general population; (iii) paediatricians; (iv) midwives; and a quantitative study on GPs. Assessment concerned feasibility, accessibility, and usefulness of the strategy; we then used the Levesque model to evaluate how it could improve access to ED exposure prevention. Results: The study included 69 participants. The strategy appeared feasible for the filling-out step due to digital and environment access. However, it depended on patient and HP profiles. The strategy seemed useful insofar as it facilitated reflexive investment, an intention to healthy behaviour and, rather rarely, talk about ED exposure. The beginning of this discussion depended on time, prioritizing of the topic and HP profile. The strategy has confirmed the Levesque model's limiting factors and levers to access ED prevention.

Cord blood DNA methylation in their children was processed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip using an epigenome-wide association approach. Using quantile g-computation, we examined the association of increasing all mixture components by one quartile with cord blood DNA methylation. We did not find evidence for statistically significant associations of a maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols during any of the trimesters of pregnancy with DNA methylation in cord blood (all p values > 4.01 * 10-8). However, we identified one suggestive association (p value < 1.0 * 10-6) of the first trimester maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols and three suggestive associations of the second trimester maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols with DNA methylation in cord blood. Although we did not identify genome-wide significant results, we identified some suggestive associations of exposure to a maternal mixture of phthalates and bisphenols in the first and second trimester with DNA methylation in cord blood that need further exploration in larger study samples.",PMC9552446

The presence of estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (EEDCs) has been implicated as a potential causal factor for these effects. The effects of prior EEDC exposure on immune response were examined in juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) exposed to a potent synthetic estrogen (17α-ethinylestradiol, EE2) at a low (EE2Low, 0.87 ng/L) or high (EE2High, 9.08 ng/L) dose for 4 weeks, followed by transfer to clean water and injection with an LD40 dose of the Gram-negative bacteria Edwardsiella piscicida. Unexpectedly, this prior exposure to EE2High significantly increased survivorship at 10 d post-infection compared to solvent control or EE2Low-exposed, infected fish. Both prior exposure and infection with E. piscicida led to significantly reduced hepatic glycogen levels, indicating a stress response resulting in depletion of energy stores. Additionally, pathway analysis for liver and spleen indicated differentially expressed genes associated with immunometabolic processes in the mock-injected EE2High treatment that could underlie the observed protective effect and metabolic shift in EE2High-infected fish. Our results demonstrate that exposure to a model EEDC alters metabolism and immune function in a fish species that is ecologically and economically important in North America.",PMC9583602

In a total population of 333 women in Sweden and Estonia, we studied the associations between chemicals and female fertility, evaluating ovarian sensitivity index (OSI) as an indicator of ovarian response, as well as clinical pregnancy and live birth from fresh and frozen embryo transfers. We measured 59 chemicals in follicular fluid samples and detected 3 phthalate metabolites, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, 1 paraben, and 6 PFAS in >90% of the women. Associations were evaluated using multivariable-adjusted linear or logistic regression, categorizing EDCs into quartiles of their distributions, as well as with Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression. We observed statistically significant lower OSI at higher concentrations of the sum of DEHP metabolites in the Swedish cohort (Q4 vs Q1, β = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.38, -0.05) and methylparaben in the Estonian cohort (Q3 vs Q1, β = -0.22, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.01).

Blood samples were collected from healthy women and women who had miscarriage in the first trimester of pregnancy. The serum levels of cytoplasmic anti-PR3 antibody and perinuclear anti-MPO antibody were determined using an immunoenzymatic method. The concentrations of key proinflammatory proteins TNF-α and MCP-1, as well as NADPH oxidase subunits NOX1 and NCF2, were also measured in the serum samples. The serum concentration of BPA was determined using gas chromatography. The results showed that the concentrations of BPA were significantly elevated in the serum of women who had miscarriage compared to the control group, with the highest concentration found in the ""NETs-positive"" group.

We investigated overall and fetal sex-specific associations of individual and cumulative phthalate/replacement biomarkers with GWG. Illinois women (n = 299) self-reported their weight pre-pregnancy and at their final obstetric appointment before delivery (median 38 weeks). We calculated pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestational age-specific GWG z-scores (GWGz). We quantified 19 phthalate/replacement metabolites (representing 10 parent compounds) in pools of up-to-five first-morning urine samples, collected approximately monthly between 8 and 40 weeks gestation. We used linear regression, quantile-based g-computation (QGComp), and weighted quantile sum regression (WQSR) to evaluate associations of ten biomarkers (individual metabolites or parent molar-sums) individually or as mixtures (in interquartile range intervals) with GWGz. We evaluated associations in all women and stratified by fetal sex. Individually, sums of metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (ƩDEHP), di(isononyl) cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (ƩDiNCH), and di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (ƩDEHTP) had consistent inverse associations with GWGz, and some associations were fetal sex-specific. When evaluating phthalates/replacements as a mixture, QGComp identified ƩDEHP, ƩDEHTP, and mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate, along with sum of di(isononyl) phthalate metabolites (ƩDiNP) and monobenzyl phthalate as notable contributors to lower and higher GWGz, respectively, resulting in a marginal inverse joint association in all women (β: -0.29; 95% CI: -0.70, 0.12).

We have previously demonstrated that adult exposure to TBT altered the expression of neuropeptides in the hypothalamus. In this study, we orally administered daily a solution containing oil, or TBT (0.25, 2.5, or 25 μg/kg body weight/day) to pregnant females from gestational day 8 until birth, and to their pups from day 0 until post-natal day 21. Our results showed that TBT exposure of female mice during gestation and of pups during lactation permanently altered the feeding efficiency of pups of both sexes and subcutaneous fat distribution in adult males. In addition, the neuropeptide Y system was affected at the level of the paraventricular nucleus, with a decrease in immunoreactivity in both sexes (significant in females for all TBT doses and in males only for intermediate TBT doses), while no effect was observed in other hypothalamic areas (arcuate, ventromedial and dorsomedial nuclei). Metabolic syndrome, as well as obesity and diabetes, which are significant health issues, are considered multifactorial diseases and may be caused by exposure to metabolic disruptors, both in adults and during perinatal life.

However, little is known about the target organs of chemical disruption of female fertility. Here, we focus on the hormone-sensitive uterine lining, the endometrium, as a potential target. Decidualization is the morphological and functional change that endometrial stromal cells undergo to support endometrial receptivity, which is crucial for successful implantation, placentation, and pregnancy. We investigated the effect of nine selected EDCs on primary human endometrial stromal cell decidualization in vitro. The cells were exposed to a decidualization-inducing mixture in the presence or absence of 1 μM of nine different EDCs for nine days. Extent of decidualization was assessed by measuring the activity of cAMP dependent protein kinase, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase, and protein kinase B in lysates using photoluminescent probes, and secretion of prolactin into the media by using ELISA. Decidualization-inducing mixture upregulated activity of protein kinases and prolactin secretion in cells derived from all women. Of the tested chemicals, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) significantly reduced decidualization as judged by the kinase markers and prolactin secretion. In addition, bisphenol A (BPA) reduced prolactin secretion but did not significantly affect activity of the kinases. None of the EDCs was cytotoxic, based on the assessment of total protein content or activity of the viability marker casein kinase 2 in lysates. These results indicate that EDCs commonly present in the blood circulation of reproductive-aged women can reduce decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells in vitro. Future studies should focus on detailed hazard assessment to define possible risks of EDC exposure to endometrial dysfunction and implantation failure in women.",PMC9437351

To determine whether maternal exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) influences adult serum INSL3 concentration, using a retrospective paradigm, INSL3 was measured in young adult male rats (80-90 days) from the F1 generation of females maternally exposed to varied doses of bisphenol A (BPA), butylparaben, epoxiconazole, and fludioxonil as single compounds, as well as estrogenic and anti-androgenic mixtures of BPA and butylparaben, and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and procymidone respectively. A mixture of BPA and butylparaben significantly reduced circulating INSL3 concentration in adult male progeny. The remaining compounds or mixtures tested, though sufficient to induce other effects in the F1 generation were without significant effect.

Few studies have examined the association between maternal exposure to OPEs and blood glucose during pregnancy. With data from 301 pregnant women in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, we examined whether OPE concentrations were associated with changes in blood glucose. We quantified four OPE metabolites in maternal spot urine samples collected at 16- and 26-weeks pregnancy. We extracted results from the glucose challenge test (GCT) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) via medical chart review. Women with GCT ≥ 140 mg/dL or any abnormal values in OGTT (≥ 95 mg/dL fasting glucose, ≥ 180 mg/dL 1-h glucose, ≥ 155 mg/dL 2-h glucose, ≥ 140 mg/dL 3-h glucose) were defined as having elevated glucose levels. We used linear regression and Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) to estimate the associations of individual OPE metabolites and OPE mixtures with blood glucose levels during pregnancy. We used modified Poisson regression to estimate the associations of OPE metabolite concentrations with elevated glucose levels. We further examined effect measure modification by maternal characteristics (age, pre-pregnancy body mass index [BMI], and race/ethnicity). Diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) had the highest geometric mean concentration of the urinary OPE metabolites (1.83 μg/L at 16 weeks, 1.24 μg/L at 26 weeks). Thirty women (10.0%) had elevated glucose levels.

In a mixed diet or especially animal feed, these potential contaminants might be ingested together with naturally occurring phytoestrogens such as soy isoflavones. So far, risk assessment of potential endocrine disruptors is usually based on adverse effects of single compounds whereas studies investigating combinatorial effects are scarce. In the present study, we investigated the estrogenic potential of mycoestrogens and the isoflavones genistein (GEN), daidzein (DAI) and glycitein (GLY) as well as equol (EQ), the gut microbial metabolite of DAI, in vitro alone or in combination, using the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) assay in Ishikawa cells.

We applied this method to rat sperm over three generations (F0, F1 and F2) with multigenerational uranium exposure. Our results show a significant content of uranium in generation F0, and a reduction in the pregnancy rate only in generation F1. Based on principal component analysis (PCA), we observed discriminant profiles between generations.

When children were age 12 years, we calculated cardiometabolic risk scores from visceral adiposity area, blood pressure, and fasting serum biomarkers. We assessed adolescent physical activity and Healthy Eating Index scores using the Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C), actigraphy, and 24-h diet recalls. Using multivariable linear regression and weighted quantile sum regression, we examined whether physical activity or diet modified covariate-adjusted associations of PFAS and their mixture with cardiometabolic risk scores. Physical activity modified associations between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and cardiometabolic risk scores. Each doubling of PFOA was associated with worse cardiometabolic risk scores among children with PAQ-C scores < median (β:1.4; 95% CI:0.5, 2.2, n = 82), but not among those with PAQ-C scores ≥ median (β: 0.2; 95% CI: 1.2, 0.7, n = 84) (interaction p-value = 0.01).

The research indicated that the keywords ""alkylphenol"" and ""nonylphenol"" were most commonly studied. The selected ICE models were robust (R2: 0.70-0.99; p-value < 0.01).

To further investigate the potential reproductive toxicity of metformin and guanylurea to fish, a series of experiments was performed with adult fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). First, explants of fathead minnow ovary tissue were exposed to 0.001-100 µM metformin or guanylurea to investigate whether the compounds could directly perturb steroidogenesis. Second, spawning pairs of fathead minnows were exposed to metformin (0.41, 4.1, and 41 µg/L) or guanylurea (1.0, 10, and 100 µg/L) for 23 days to assess impacts on reproduction. Lastly, male fathead minnows were exposed to 41 µg/L metformin, 100 µg/L guanylurea, or a mixture of both compounds, with samples collected over a 96-h time course to investigate potential impacts to the hepatic transcriptome or metabolome. Neither metformin nor guanylurea affected steroid production by ovary tissue exposed ex vivo. In the 23 days of exposure, neither compound significantly impacted transcription of endocrine-related genes in male liver or gonad, circulating steroid concentrations in either sex, or fecundity of spawning pairs. In the 96-h time course, 100 µg guanylurea/L elicited more differentially expressed genes than 41 µg metformin/L and showed the greatest impacts at 96 h.

PAH exposure might be particularly detrimental during pregnancy, as this is a time when the breast tissue of both the mother and daughter is undergoing structural and functional changes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ambient PAH exposure during pregnancy is associated with breast tissue composition, measured one to two decades later, in adolescent daughters and their mothers. We conducted a prospective analysis using data from a New York City cohort of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic mother-daughter dyads (recruited 1998-2006). During the third trimester of pregnancy, women wore backpacks containing a continuously operating air sampling pump for two consecutive days that measured ambient exposure to eight carcinogenic higher molecular weight nonvolatile PAH compounds (Σ8 PAH) and pyrene. When daughters (n = 186) and mothers (n = 175) reached ages 11-20 and 29-55 years, respectively, optical spectroscopy (OS) was used to evaluate measures of breast tissue composition (BTC) that positively (water content, collagen content, optical index) and negatively (lipid content) correlate with mammographic breast density, a recognized risk factor for breast cancer. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate associations between ambient PAH exposure and BTC, overall and by exposure to household tobacco smoke during pregnancy (yes/no). Models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, and percent body fat at OS. No overall associations were found between ambient PAH exposure (Σ8 PAH or pyrene) and BTC, but statistically significant additive interactions between Σ8 PAH and household tobacco smoke exposure were identified for water content and optical index in both daughters and mothers (interaction p values < 0.05). Σ8 PAH exposure was associated with higher water content (βdaughters = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.15-0.68; βmothers = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.05-0.61) and higher optical index (βdaughters = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.12-0.64; βmothers = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.12-0.65) in those exposed to household tobacco smoke during pregnancy; no associations were found in non-smoking households (interaction p values < 0.05). Exposure to ambient Σ8 PAH and tobacco smoke during pregnancy might interact synergistically to impact BTC in mothers and daughters.

Exposure to PFAS has been associated with the imbalance of thyroid hormones. However, available studies addressing the cell mechanism underlying thyroid disrupting feature of legacy PFAS, such as perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoro-octane-sulfonic acid (PFOS), and the new generation substitutes, such as C6O4, are still lacking. In this study the potential disrupting effect of PFOA, PFOS, and C6O4 on a murine thyroid cell model was assessed. A rat FRTL-5 cell line was used as the normal thyroid follicular cell model. Cell iodide-uptake, induced by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), was used to assess the functional impact of PFAS exposure on cell function. Tetrazolium salt-based cell viability assay and merocyanine 540-based cell staining were used to address the possible involvement of cell toxicity and membrane biophysical properties on altered cell function. The possible direct interaction of PFAS with TSH-receptor (TSH-R) was investigated by computer-based molecular docking and analysis of molecular dynamics. Evaluation of intracellular cAMP levels and gene expression analysis were used to validate the direct impairment of TSH-R-mediated downstream events upon PFAS exposure. Different from PFOS or C6O4, exposure to PFOA at a concentration ≥ 10 ng/mL was associated with significant impairment of the iodide uptake upon TSH stimulation (respectively: basal 100.0 ± 19.0%, CTRL + TSH 188.9 ± 7.8%, PFOA 10 ng/mL + TSH 120.4 ± 20.9%, p= 0.030 vs CTRL + TSH; PFOA 100 ng/mL + TSH 115,6 ± 12,3% p= 0.017 vs CTRL + TSH). No impairment of cell viability or membrane stability was observed. Computational analysis showed a possible direct differential interaction of C6O4, PFOA, and PFOS on a same binding site of the extracellular domain of TSH-R. Finally, exposure to PFOA was associated with a significant reduction of downstream intracellular cAMP levels and both sodium-iodide transporter and thyroperoxidase gene expression upon TSH-R stimulation. Our data suggest that legacy and new generation PFAS can differentially influence TSH dependent signaling pathways through the direct interaction with TSH-R.",PMC9259843

Fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each chemical adjusting for age, body mass index, serum cotinine, creatinine, and accounting for right censoring and left truncation. Models evaluated effect modification between EDC concentrations and TTP by partner's age, dichotomized at 35 years. Separate models were run for male and female partners. No significant effect modification was observed for any EDC for either partner, but data were suggestive of a longer TTP among females aged ≥35 years, particularly for BP-2 (FOR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.36, 1.05) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (FOR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.09) reflecting 39% and 29% reductions in fecundability, respectively.

To investigate associations of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures with liver injury risk and hepatocellular apoptosis in childhood. This prospective cohort study used data collected from April 1, 2003, to February 26, 2016, from mother-child pairs from the Human Early-Life Exposome project, a collaborative network of 6 ongoing, population-based prospective birth cohort studies from 6 European countries (France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the UK). Data were analyzed from April 1, 2021, to January 31, 2022. Three organochlorine pesticides, 5 polychlorinated biphenyls, 2 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 3 phenols, 4 parabens, 10 phthalates, 4 organophosphate pesticides, 5 perfluoroalkyl substances, and 9 metals. Child serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and CK-18 were measured at 6 to 11 years of age. Risk for liver injury was defined as having ALT, AST, and/or GGT levels above the 90th percentile. Associations of liver injury or cytokeratin 18 (CK-18) levels with each chemical group among the 45 EDCs measured in maternal blood or urine samples collected in pregnancy were estimated using 2 complimentary exposure-mixture methods: bayesian weighted quantile sum (BWQS) and bayesian kernel machine regression.

However, it was unknown if maternal exposure to the mixture affects reproductive parameters and ovarian post-transcription in the F1 and F2 generation of female rats. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that maternal exposure to the phthalate mixture affects folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, and ovarian microRNA (miRNA) in the F1 and F2 generations of female rats. Pregnant female rats were divided into 4 groups and orally dosed daily from gestational day 10 to postnatal day 21 with corn oil (control group), 20 μg/kg/day, 200 μg/kg/day, or 200 mg/kg/day of the phthalate mixture. Maternal exposure to the phthalate mixture impaired folliculogenesis in the F1 and F2 generations of female rats and affected steroidogenesis in the F1 generation of female rats compared to control. Further, the phthalate mixture altered ovarian expression of some genes related to the cell cycle and steroidogenesis compared to control in the F1 and F2 generations of female rats. The mixture also increased ovarian expression of rno-mir-184 that is involved with the oocyte maturation process.

The thymus is a lymphoid and also an endocrine organ, and, accordingly, its development and functioning may be impaired by endocrine disruptors. The aim was to evaluate age-related thymus involution in mature rats exposed to the endocrine disruptor DDT during prenatal and postnatal ontogeny. Methodology included in vivo experiment on male Wistar rats exposed to low doses of DDT during prenatal and postnatal development and morphological assessment of thymic involution, including the immunohistochemical detection of proliferating thymocytes. The study was carried out at the early stage of involution. Results: DDT-exposed rats exhibited a normal anatomy, and the relative weight of the thymus was within the control ranges. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed increased cellularity of the cortex and the medulla, higher content of lymphoblasts, and more intensive proliferation rate of thymocytes compared to the control. Evaluation of thymic epithelial cells revealed a higher rate of thymic corpuscles formation. Conclusion: The data obtained indicate that endocrine disrupter DDT disturbs postnatal development of the thymus. Low-dose exposure to DDT during ontogeny does not suppress growth rate but violates the developmental program of the thymus by slowing down the onset of age-related involution and maintaining high cell proliferation rate. It may result in excessive formation of thymus-dependent areas in peripheral lymphoid organs and altered immune response.",PMC9223823

We used multivariable linear regression analyses to estimate associations between maternal urinary log10-transformed BPA concentration and BASC-2 subscale and composite scores and SRS-2 Total Score. To examine the role of socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with study site, we stratified by TIDES center, comparing those enrolled at University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC), a predominately lower socioeconomic population, and those enrolled elsewhere: University of Washington, University of Minnesota, and University of California San Francisco, whose populations share similar higher socioeconomic demographic characteristics. Across all centers, no associations were seen between BPA and BASC-2 or SRS-2 scores. When stratifying by center, BPA was significantly associated with greater social impairment as measured by the SRS-2 Total Score (β-coefficient [95 % confidence intervals]: 5.1 [1.0, 9.2]) in URMC participants (N = 61). In non-URMC participants (N = 183), BPA was significantly associated with lower BASC-2 Internalizing composite (-3.3 [-6.7, 0.0]) and Depression subscale scores (-3.4 [-6.7, 0.0]) while no associations were seen between BPA and SRS-2 scores. Our findings suggest that sociodemographic factors may modify the impacts of maternal prenatal BPA on developmental endpoints.",PMC10026942

In the present study, we tested the effect of BaP on thyroid development and function, using zebrafish as a model system. Zebrafish embryos were treated with 50 nM BaP from 2.5 to 72 h post fertilization (hpf) and compared to 1.2% DMSO controls. The expression profiles of markers of thyroid primordium specification, thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis, hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, TH transport and metabolism, and TH action were analyzed in pools of treated and control embryos at different developmental stages. BaP treatment did not affect early markers of thyroid differentiation but resulted in a significant decrease of markers of TH synthesis (tg and nis) likely secondary to defective expression of the central stimulatory hormones of thyroid axis (trh, tshba) and of TH metabolism (dio2). Consequently, immunofluorescence of BaP treated larvae showed a low number of follicles immunoreactive to T4. In conclusion, our results revealed that the short-term exposure to BaP significantly affects thyroid function in zebrafish, but the primary toxic effects would be exerted at the hypothalamic-pituitary level thus creating a model of central hypothyroidism.",PMC9148134

Despite increasing reports of adverse health effects associated with exposure to EDCs, there are limited data on the effect of BPA in normal human ovaries. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the transcriptomic landscape in normal Human Epithelial Ovarian Cells (HOSEpiC) treated with BPA (10 and 100 nM). Gene expression profiles were determined using high-throughput RNA sequencing, followed by functional analyses using bioinformatics tools. In total, 272 and 454 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in 10 and 100 nM BPA-treated HOSEpiCs, respectively, compared to untreated controls. Biological pathways included mRNA surveillance pathways, oocyte meiosis, cellular senescence, and transcriptional misregulation in cancer. BPA exposure has a considerable impact on 10 genes: ANAPC2, AURKA, CDK1, CCNA2, CCNB1, PLK1, BUB1, KIF22, PDE3B, and CCNB3, which are also associated with progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathways. Future studies should further explore the effects of BPA and its metabolites in the ovaries in health and disease, making use of validated in vitro and in vivo models to generate data that will address existing knowledge gaps in basic biology, hazard characterisation, and risk assessment associated with the use of xenoestrogens such as BPA.",PMC9141570

Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to clarify whether prenatal and postnatal exposures to phthalates are associated with physical growth disturbances in children. We performed the systematic review and meta-analysis following the PRISMA 2020 statement guidelines, and found 39 studies that met our inclusion criteria, including 22 longitudinal and 17 cross-sectional studies. We observed a significant negative association between the prenatal exposure to DEHP and the body mass index (BMI) z-score of the offspring (β = - 0.05; 95% CI: - 0.10, - 0.001) in the meta-analysis, while no significant association between the prenatal exposure to DEHP and the body fat percentage of the offspring was observed (β = 0.01; 95% CI: - 0.41, 0.44). In the systematic review, studies on the association between phthalates exposure in childhood and obesity were inconsistent. Prenatal exposure to phthalates was found to be associated with decreased BMI z-score in children, but not associated with body fat percentage.

In a prospective birth cohort study, five first-morning urine samples collected across pregnancy were pooled and the following phthalate biomarkers assessed: sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP), sum of diisononyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDINP), sum of dibutyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDBP), sum of anti-androgenic metabolites (ΣAA), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), and sum of all phthalate metabolites (ΣAll). The Ages & Stages Questionnaires® (ASQ), a standardized parent-reported, age-adapted screening tool, measured communication, personal-social, problem solving, and motor domains in infants at 4.5 and 7.5 months (n = 123). Adjusting for maternal age, annual household income, gestational age at birth, infant age at assessment, and sex, repeated-measures generalized linear regression models were used to examine associations between prenatal phthalate urine biomarker concentrations and domain scores (assuming a Poisson distribution). Beta estimates were exponentiated back to the domain scale for ease of interpretation. Mothers were mostly white and college-educated, and most reported an annual household income of ≥$60,000. Associations of phthalate concentrations with ASQ outcomes are presented as follows: (1) anti-androgenic phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP, ΣDINP, ΣDBP, and ΣAA), (2) MEP, which is not anti-androgenic, and (3) ΣAll. Overall, anti-androgenic phthalates were associated with higher (i.e., better) scores. However, there were exceptions, including the finding that a one-unit increase in ΣDBP was associated with a 12% increase in problem solving scores in 4.5-month-old females (β = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.28; p = 0.067) but a 85% decrease for 7.5-month-old females (β = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.99; p = 0.047). In contrast, MEP was associated with poorer scores on several outcomes. Sex- and timepoint-specific estimates demonstrated a one-unit increase in MEP was associated with: a 52% decrease in personal-social scores in 7.5-month-old males (β = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.95; p = 0.02), a 39% decrease in fine motor scores in 7.5-month-old males (β = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.98; p = 0.035), and a 6% decrease in fine motor scores in 4.5-month-old females (β = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.99; p = 0.03).

Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case-control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00--1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02-1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00-1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00-1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis. These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.",PMC9109392

Using a job-exposure matrix, exposure probability scores for ten EDC groups were assigned to each mother based on her longest held job during pregnancy. At the child's 5-year visit, the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities was administered, yielding the general cognitive index and scales for specific cognitive domains. We analyzed region-specific associations between EDC exposures and each outcome separately using adjusted linear regression and combined region-specific effect estimates using random-effects meta-analyses. Approximately 24% of women were exposed to at least one EDC group, but exposure to most individual EDC groups was low (<5%). Maternal organic solvent exposure was associated with lower quantitative scores among children (-5.8 points, 95% confidence interval: -11.0, -0.5). Though statistically non-significant, exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalates, alkylphenolic compounds, and miscellaneous chemicals were associated with poorer offspring performance for most or all cognitive domains. This study found limited evidence for a role of maternal occupational EDC exposures on child cognition. Further research is needed to better characterize exposures among pregnant workers. Using data from a prospective birth cohort, we help fill an important research gap regarding the potential consequences of work-related exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) among pregnant women on child neurodevelopment. We expand on existing literature-largely limited to pesticide and organic solvent exposures-by using a job-exposure matrix to estimate exposure to several EDC groups.

We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 µM).

Regarding cell viability, BPA and TBT increased cell death as previously observed. Their mode of action involved the activation of estrogen receptors and PPARγ, respectively. ROS production was a consistent key event in BPA-and TBT-treated cells. None of the other MDCs tested modified viability or ROS production. Concerning GSIS, TBT increased insulin secretion while BPA produced no effects. PFOA decreased GSIS, suggesting that this chemical could be a ""new"" diabetogenic agent.

Endocrine disruption of epinephrine synthesis, secretion and signaling is less studied than steroid and thyroid hormones. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is recognized as one of the most prominent environmental contaminants with a long half-life. It is a potent endocrine disrupter affecting sex steroid, mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone production. Exposure to low doses of DDT is universal and begins in utero. Therefore, we studied adrenal medulla growth and function in male Wistar rats exposed to low doses of DDT during prenatal and postnatal development until puberty and adulthood, as well as rats exposed to DDT since the first day of postnatal development. All the exposed rats demonstrated lowered epinephrine blood levels, gradually reducing with age. DDT was found to inhibit the synthesis of tyrosine hydroxylase and affect the mitochondrial apparatus of epinephrine-producing cells during puberty and even after maturation. Low-dose exposure to DDT from birth resulted in more pronounced changes in adrenomedullary cells and a more profound decrease (up to 50%) in epinephrine secretion in adult rats. Prenatal onset of exposure demonstrated a mild effect on epinephrine-producing function (30% reduction), but was associated with lower rate of adrenal medulla growth during maturation and 25% smaller adrenal medullar size in adult rats.

In addition, sera were collected to measure reproductive hormone levels. IAA exposure decreased vaginal opening rate, increased the absolute weight of the ovaries, increased anogenital index, and decreased the percentage of atretic follicles in female pups compared to control. IAA exposure caused a borderline decrease in the levels of progesterone and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increased levels of testosterone in female pups compared to control.

However, a growing body of literature has recognized that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may play an important role in this global trend, but the association has not yet been fully established. EDCs can interfere with normal hormone function and metabolism and play a role in pubertal onset. We aimed to systematically identify and evaluate the current evidence on the timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys following prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs. Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in the PubMed database through a block search approach using a combination of index MeSH and free text search terms. Publications were considered if they covered biomarkers of prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs (European Commission's list of category 1 EDCs) measured in maternal or child biospecimen and pubertal onset defined by the progression of the following milestones (and assessed in terms of the following measures): menarche (age), thelarche (Tanner staging) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in girls, and genital stage (Tanner staging), testicular volume (ml) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in boys. The literature search resulted in 703 references, of which we identified 52 publications fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the qualitative trend synthesis and 23 publications for the meta-analysis. The qualitative trend synthesis provided data on 103 combinations of associations between prenatal or postnatal exposure to EDC compounds groups and puberty outcomes and the meta-analysis enabled 18 summary risk estimates of meta-associations. Statistically significant associations in the qualitative trend synthesis suggested that postnatal exposure to phthalates may be associated with earlier thelarche and later pubarche. However, we did not find consistent evidence in the meta-analysis for associations between timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys and exposures to any of the studied xenobiotic EDCs. We were not able to identify specific pre- or postnatal windows of exposure as particularly critical and susceptible for effects of EDCs. Current evidence is subject to several methodological challenges and inconsistencies and evidence on specific exposure-outcome associations remains too scarce to firmly confirm EDC exposure as a risk factor for changes in age of pubertal onset in the general child population. To create a more uniform foundation for future comparison of evidence and to strengthen pooled studies, we recommend the use of more standardized approaches in the choice of statistical analyses, with exposure transformations, and in the definitions and assessments of puberty outcomes. The impact of mixtures of EDC exposures on the association also remains unestablished and would be valuable to elucidate for prenatal and postnatal windows of exposure. Future large, longitudinal epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the overall association.",PMC9434240

Separate interval-censored models were used to assess associations of quartiles of prepubertal phthalate metabolites with each pubertal onset indicator, G2+, P2+ and TV > 3 mL, adjusted for covariates and urine specific gravity. 304 boys had 752 prepubertal urine samples (median 2, range: 1-6) for pooling. In adjusted models, higher urinary AAPs were consistently associated with later pubertal onset (P2) with mean shifts ranging from 8.4 to 14.2 months for the highest versus lowest quartiles. Significantly later onset for G2 and TV > 3 mL was observed for higher versus lower quartiles of MiBP, MBzP, ∑DEHP and ∑DiNP. On average, boys with higher concentrations of prepubertal urinary AAPs had later pubertal onset by six months to over a year. The impact of AAPs on timing of male puberty may be attributable to disruption of androgen-dependent biological pathways.",PMC9310051

The present study examines associations between maternal occupational exposures and ultrasound-measured fetal growth. We included 1,739 singleton pregnancies from the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) project (2003-2008). At 32 weeks of pregnancy, interviewers ascertained mothers' employment status and assessed job-related physical loads, work schedules, and job strain during pregnancy. Job titles were linked to a job-exposure matrix to estimate exposure to 10 endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) groups. We calculated z-scores from longitudinal growth curves representing trajectories from 0-12, 12-20 and 20-34 gestational weeks for abdominal circumference (AC), biparietal diameter (BPD), femur length (FL), and estimated fetal weight (EFW). Linear mixed models clustered by IMNA region (i.e., Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, Valencia) were used to examine associations between occupational exposures and fetal growth. Effect estimates are presented as percentage change in fetal growth. There was limited evidence of associations between work-related non-chemical stressors and fetal growth. We observed associations of similar magnitude between multiple EDC groups and decreased EFW trajectories during 20-34 gestational weeks (phthalates: -1.4% [-3.5, 0.6%]; alkylphenolic compounds (APCs): -1.1% [-2.3, 0.1%]; miscellaneous chemicals: -1.5% [-3.7, 0.8%]), while miscellaneous chemicals were associated with increased BPD from 12-20 weeks (2.1% [0.8, 3.5%]). Notably, 67% of women exposed to phthalates were hairdressers; 68% of women exposed to APCs worked as domestic cleaners. In conclusion, we found limited evidence that maternal occupational exposures impact fetal growth. Further research should consider the combined impact of multiple workplace exposures.",PMC8989310

Causal mediation analysis was applied to quantify the degree to which follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol levels could mediate the associations between PFAS and incident natural menopause. Participants with higher PFAS concentrations had shorter times to natural menopause, with a relative survival of 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69, 0.96) for linear perfluorooctane sulfonate (n-PFOS), 0.84 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.00) for sum of branched-chain perfluorooctane sulfonate (Sm-PFOS), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.93) for linear-chain perfluorooctanoate (n-PFOA), and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.97) for perfluorononanoate (PFNA), comparing the highest tertile of PFAS concentrations with the lowest.

In this study, six congeners of PAEs were measured in water and sediment samples to elucidate their spatial distribution, congener profiles, and ecological risks in the middle-lower Hanjiang River during the wet and dry seasons. The concentration of the Σ6PAEs ranged from 592 to 2.75 × 103 ng/L with an average of 1.47 × 103 ng/L in surface water, while the concentration of the Σ6PAEs ranged from 1.12 × 103 to 6.61 × 103 ng/g with an average of 2.69 × 103 ng/g in sediments. In general, PAE concentrations were ranked as sediment > water, and dry season > wet season. DEHP and DBP were the dominant PAEs in the middle-lower Hanjiang River in surface water and sediments. SPSS analysis showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in surface water was significantly correlated with the concentration of DBP, DEHP, and the ∑6PAEs, while organic matter (OM) was significantly correlated with the concentration of the ∑6PAEs in sediments. The concentrations of PAEs were irregularly distributed and varied significantly in surface water and sediments.

The aim of this study was to assess the role of 17β-estradiol and its metabolites: 2-MeOE2, 16α-OHE1 in exposure to the metalloestrogen cadmium. The effect of interactions of cadmium with estrogens on the viability of cells in malignant ovarian cancer cells SKOV-3 was investigated, both in simultaneous action and in the pre-incubation model. There are no known interactions between estrogens and cadmium in ovarian cancer cells. Due to the frequent occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in ovarian cancer, the effects of estrogens and cadmium on MDR in SKOV-3, measured as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), were assessed. An interaction study showed that E2 had an antagonistic effect on cadmium-induced cell damage, while 2-MeOE2 showed less of a protective effect in combination with CdCl2 than E2. There were two types of interaction: toxic synergism and beneficial antagonism. E2 and cadmium increased P-gp expression in SKOV-3 cells, while 2-MeOE2 decreased P-gp expression to a potentially beneficial effect on MDR prevention.

However, in vivo assessment of CYN in the female and male reproductive systems remains unknown. We thus aimed to evaluate the in vivo effects of CYN in both the female and male reproductive systems of mice. A single intraperitoneal exposure to 64 µg of CYN/kg body weight was performed in females. Estrous cycle was evaluated daily by vaginal cytology, and serum progesterone and estradiol levels were measured after 50 days. We showed an impairment in the estrous cycle as well as a decrease in circulating plasma progesterone levels. In males, weekly intraperitoneal doses of 20 μg of CYN/kg body weight were given and groups were killed after one, two, or four doses. CYN increased the testosterone levels in the groups that received one or two doses of CYN. Additionally, CYN induced a transient increase in spermatozoa in males after four doses.

Identifying maternal characteristics associated with phthalate/replacement exposure during pregnancy is important. We evaluated 13 maternal sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, enrollment year, and conception season as determinants of exposure biomarkers of phthalates and their replacements in 482 pregnant women from the Illinois Kids Development Study (I-KIDS, enrolled 2013-2018). We quantified 19 phthalate/replacement metabolites in pools of five first-morning urines collected across pregnancy. K-means clustering identified women with distinct patterns of biomarker concentrations and principal component analysis (PCA) identified principal component (PC) profiles of biomarkers that exist together. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations of predictors with identified k-means clusters and PCs. K-means clustering identified two clusters of women: 1) low phthalate/di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (∑DEHTP) and 2) high phthalate/∑DEHTP biomarker concentrations. PCA identified four PCs with loadings heaviest for biomarkers of plasticizer phthalates [di-isononyl, di-isodecyl, di-n-octyl phthalates] (PC1), of other phthalates [dibenzyl, di-n-butyl, di-iso-butyl phthalates] (PC2), of phthalate replacements [∑DEHTP, di(isononyl) cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (∑DiNCH)] (PC3), and of monoethyl phthalate [MEP] (PC4).

However, studies identifying and experimentally testing adverse effects of real-life mixtures are scarce. In this study, we aimed at evaluating an epidemiologically identified EDC mixture in an experimental setting to delineate its cellular and epigenetic effects. The mixture was established using data from the Swedish Environmental Longitudinal Mother and child Asthma and allergy (SELMA) study where it was associated with lower birth weight, an early marker for prenatal metabolic programming. This mixture was then tested for its ability to change metabolic programming of human mesenchymal stem cells. In these cells, we assessed if the mixture induced adipogenesis and genome-wide DNA methylation changes. The mixture increased lipid droplet accumulation already at concentrations corresponding to levels measured in the pregnant women of the SELMA study. Furthermore, we identified differentially methylated regions in genes important for adipogenesis and thermogenesis.

Our objective is to demonstrate the use of an index as a metric for more causally linking human exposure to health outcomes using observational data. We use both a WQS index of 26 endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and MNI using data from the SELMA pregnancy cohort to conduct causal inference using g-computation with counterfactuals for assumed either reduced prenatal EDC exposures or improved prenatal nutrition. Reducing the EDC exposure using the WQS index as a metric or improving dietary nutrition using MNI as a metric, the counterfactuals in a causal inference with one SD change indicate significant improvement in cognitive function.

Three neonicotinoid insecticides (Acetamiprid, Clothianidin, and Thiamethoxam), a carbamate insecticide (Methiocarb) and a herbicide (Oxadiazon) were tested. The effect of pesticides on estrogen biosynthesis was studied through an ELISA assay using a recombinant form of human aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of androgens to estrogens. Moreover, the effect of pesticides on estrogen signaling was assessed using a gene reporter assay on MELN cells, which measures estrogen receptor-mediated estrogenic activity. The results of the ELISA assay showed that the pesticides did not alter aromatase activity (no interference with estrogen biosynthesis), while the results of the gene reporter assay showed that only Methiocarb was able to alter estrogen signaling at high doses. The estrogenic activity of Methiocarb, expressed as 17β-estradiol equivalency factor (EEF), was equal to 8.0 × 10-8.

However, our ability to interpret links between testicular oocyte occurrence in wild fish species and environmental pollutants is limited by our understanding of normal and abnormal gonadal development. We previously reported low-to-moderate testicular oocyte prevalence (7%-38%) among adult male bass collected from Minnesota waters with no known sources of estrogenic compounds. In the present study, two experiments were conducted in which smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) fry were exposed to control water or 17-α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) during gonadal differentiation, then reared in clean water for an additional period. Histological samples were evaluated at several time points during the exposure and grow-out periods, and the sequence and timing of gonadal development in the presence of estrogen were compared with that of control fish. Testicular oocytes were not observed in any control or EE2-exposed fish. Among groups exposed to 1.2 or 5.1 ng/L EE2 in Experiment 1 or 3.0 ng/L EE2 in Experiment 2, ovaries were observed in 100% of fish up to 90 days after exposure ceased, and approximately half of those ovaries had abnormal characteristics, suggesting that they likely developed in sex-reversed males. Groups exposed to 0.1, 0.4, or 1.0 ng/L in Experiment 2 developed histologically normal ovaries and testes in proportions not significantly different from 1:1. These findings suggest that, while presumably able to cause sex reversal, juvenile exposure to EE2 may not be a unique cause of testicular oocytes in wild bass, although the long-term outcomes of exposure are unknown.

Given that disruption of fetal ovarian development may impact women's reproductive health, we investigated the effects of APAP on fetal human ovaries in culture. Human ovarian fragments from 284 fetuses aged 7 to 12 developmental weeks (DW) were cultivated ex vivo for 7 days in the presence of human-relevant concentrations of APAP (10-8 to 10-3 M) or vehicle control. Outcomes included examination of postculture tissue morphology, cell viability, apoptosis, and quantification of hormones, APAP, and APAP metabolites in conditioned culture media. APAP reduced the total cell number specifically in 10- to 12-DW ovaries, induced cell death, and decreased KI67-positive cell density independently of fetal age. APAP targeted subpopulations of germ cells and disrupted human fetal ovarian steroidogenesis, without affecting prostaglandin or inhibin B production. Human fetal ovaries were able to metabolize APAP. Our data indicate that APAP can impact first trimester human fetal ovarian development, especially during a 10- to 12-DW window of heightened sensitivity.

Consistently, these PFASs significantly decreased the expression of PSA and FKBP5 and increased the expression of AR, similar to the effects elicited by a known competitive AR inhibitor, hydroxyflutamide. This suggests they are competitive antagonists of AR activity and western blot analysis revealed these PFASs decreased intracellular AR protein in androgen sensitive human prostate cancer cells. Hence, the findings presented here corroborate our published in silico approach and indicate these emerging PFASs may adversely affect the human endocrine system.",PMC9705075

It is an alternative to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a well-known reprotoxic and endocrine disruptor. As plasticizers are known to easily migrate when in contact with fatty biological fluids, patient exposure to TEHTM is highly probable. However, there is currently no data on the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of its human metabolites. To evaluate the effects of TEHTM metabolites on endocrine activity, they were first synthesized and their effects on estrogen, androgen and thyroid receptors, as well as steroid synthesis, were investigated by combining in vitro and in silico approaches. Among the primary metabolites, only 4-MEHTM (4-mono-(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate) showed agonist activities on ERs and TRs, while three diesters were TR antagonists at non-cytotoxic concentrations. These results were completed by docking experiments which specified the ER and TR isoforms involved. A mixture of 2/1-MEHTM significantly increased the estradiol level and reduced the testosterone level in H295R cell culture supernatants. The oxidized secondary metabolites of TEHTM had no effect on ER, AR, TR receptors or on steroid hormone synthesis. Among the fourteen metabolites, these data showed that two of them (4-MEHTM and 2/1-MEHTM) induced effect on hormonal activities in vitro. However, by comparing the concentrations of the primary metabolites found in human urine with the active concentrations determined in bioassays, it can be suggested that the metabolites will not be active with regard to estrogen, androgen, thyroid receptors and steroidogenesis-mediated effects.",7916494

Growth and development are regulated by hormones and are therefore sensitive to changes in temperature and environmental endocrine disruption. Here, we show that the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) at an environmentally relevant concentration (10 µgl-1) decreased fish (Danio rerio) size at 30°C water temperature. Under the same conditions, it significantly increased metabolic rates and the energetic cost of growth across development. By contrast, BPA decreased the cost of growth at cooler temperatures (24°C). BPA-mediated changes in cost of growth were not associated with mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios (i.e. adenosine diphosphate (ADP) used/oxygen consumed) and respiratory control ratios) although BPA did increase mitochondrial proton leak. In females, BPA decreased age at maturity at 24°C but increased it at 30°C, and it decreased the gonadosomatic index suggesting reduced investment into reproduction. Our data reveal a potentially serious emerging problem: increasing water temperatures resulting from climate warming together with endocrine disruption from plastic pollution can impact animal growth efficiency, and hence the dynamics and resilience of animal populations and the services these provide.",PMC8790379

The literature lacks clear data that allow any meaningful conclusions to be drawn about the influence of trace elements in erythrocytes on the biochemical parameters of PCOS. This study was conducted among 47 women meeting the Rotterdam criteria for the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome. The research groups included women with PCOS with different BMI values (body mass index): obese women with PCOS (PCOS with BMI ≥ 30, mean BMI index 35.4 ± 4.4 kg/m2), nonobese PCOS women (PCOS with BMI < 30, mean BMI index 25.2 ± 2.8 kg/m2), and healthy control group (CG) with a mean BMI of 23.57 ± 0.9 kg/m2. The contents of trace elements in erythrocytes were determined with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. The only trace element showing significant differences in concentration between the studied groups was nickel (Ni). The level of nickel in the obese women with PCOS (BMI ≥ 30) was significantly higher than in nonobese women (BMI < 30). The content of other trace elements in erythrocytes did not differ significantly between the studied groups. Several significant correlations were found within each of the studied PCOS groups: in the group of obese women, the content of zinc (Zn) in erythrocytes positively correlated with prolactin, the content of magnesium (Mg) positively correlated with testosterone, and the content of manganese (Mn) negatively correlated with thyroid-stimulating hormone. In the group of nonobese women, Zn content correlated positively with testosterone, Ni with luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol, and Mg negatively correlated with estradiol. The relationship between the level of trace elements and the level of hormones suggests that, in obese women with PCOS, nickel may play a role in inhibiting the processes of folliculogenesis and ovulation. Research on trace elements and their relationship to ovulatory cycles and the development of PCOS may contribute to reducing the consequences of PCOS and, therefore, should be extended.",PMC8775794

Using estrogen biosensor zebrafish models, we found that estrogen activity in the embryonic brain occurs from early neurogenesis specifically in a type of glia in the olfactory bulb (OB), which we name estrogen-responsive olfactory bulb (EROB) cells. In response to estrogen, EROB cells overlay the outermost layer of the OB and interact tightly with olfactory sensory neurons at the olfactory glomeruli. Inhibiting estrogen activity using an estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI182,780 (ICI), and/or EROB cell ablation impedes olfactory glomerular development, including the topological organisation of olfactory glomeruli and inhibitory synaptogenesis in the OB. Furthermore, activation of estrogen signalling inhibits both intrinsic and olfaction-dependent neuronal activity in the OB, whereas ICI or EROB cell ablation results in the opposite effect on neuronal excitability. Altering the estrogen signalling disrupts olfaction-mediated behaviour in later larval stage. We propose that estrogens act on glia to regulate development of OB circuits, thereby modulating the local excitability in the OB and olfaction-mediated behaviour.",PMC8881738

Therefore, there is potential continual exposure to this compound. BPA exposure has been linked to certain placenta-associated obstetric complications such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, miscarriage, and preterm birth. However, how BPA exposure results in these disorders remains uncertain. Hence, we have herein summarized the reported impacts of BPA on the morphology and metabolic state of the placenta and have proposed mechanisms by which BPA affects placentation, potentially leading to obstetric complications. Current findings suggest that BPA induces pathological changes in the placenta and disrupts its metabolic activities. Based on exposure concentrations, BPA can elicit apoptotic or anti-apoptotic signals in the trophoblasts, and can exaggerate trophoblast fusion while inhibiting trophoblast migration and invasion to affect pregnancy. Accordingly, the usage of BPA products by pregnant women should be minimized and less harmful alternative chemicals should be explored and employed where possible.",PMC9113501

The PREVED (PREgnancy, preVention, Endocrine Disruptors) project was developed to improve knowledge, to enhance risk perception, and to change exposure behavior. Our objective was to present the phases of the PREVED project using the RE-AIM method. PREVED intervention consisted of three workshops during pregnancy. Reach, adoption, and implementation phases were assessed with qualitative studies. Efficacy study consisted of a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) on 268 pregnant women: (i) control group (leaflet), (ii) intervention group in neutral location, (iii) intervention group in contextualized location. The main outcome was the percentage evolution of participants who reported consuming canned food. Secondary outcomes were evolution of psycho-social scores, evolution of ED presence in urine, and ED presence in colostrum. The intervention adoption was centered on upper-privileged women, but implementation assessment showed that key features (highly practical intervention) seemed to be carried out and had initiated some behavior changes. A total of 268 pregnant women participated in the intervention and 230 in a randomized controlled trial (control group: 86 and intervention groups: 172). We found no significant differences in consumption of canned food and in percentage of women having a decrease of bisphenol A or parabens in urine, but we found a significant increase in the evolution of risk perception score and overall psychosocial score in intervention groups (respectively: +15.73 control versus +21.03 intervention, p = 0.003 and +12.39 versus +16.20, p = 0.02). We found a significant difference in percentage of women with butylparaben detection between control group and intervention groups (13% versus 3%, p = 0.03). PREVED intervention is the first intervention research dedicated to perinatal environmental health education in France.

Intersex occurred with mean frequencies between 0.87% and 12%. It was striking that the incidence of intersex increased with increasing distance from the sea.

Paired samples of maternal serum, urine and amniotic fluid were concurrently collected (<1 h) from 200 pregnant women (age >18 years) with a singleton pregnancy and undergoing amniocentesis between gestational weeks 12 - 36. The concentration of six different parabens, seven phenols, 31 metabolites from 15 phthalate diesters and the polychlorinated substance triclocarban were analyzed by isotope diluted TurboFlow-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of all included compounds were highest in maternal urine followed by serum, and lowest in amniotic fluid. Of the six parabens measured in amniotic fluid, methylparaben (MeP) and ethylparaben (EtP) were detectable most often (87% and 33% of the samples, respectively). Of the seven phenols measured, three (2,4-dichlorphenol, 2,5-dichlorphenol, 2-propylphenol) were detectable in the range of 14-21% of the amniotic fluid samples, at low concentrations (<0.12 ng/ml). Two secondary phthalates metabolites, mono-(2-carboxymethyl-hexyl) phthalate and mono-carboxy-iso-octyl phthalate were each present in ≤15% of the amniotic fluid samples at concentrations 2-5 times lower than in maternal serum and 20-100 times lower than in maternal urine. A modest statistically significant correlation between the levels of MeP and EtP was detected in paired maternal urine-amniotic fluid samples was detected (Spearman rMeP: 0.246; rEtP: 0.364). Likewise, the concentration of mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) in paired maternal urine and amniotic fluid samples indicated a modest statistically significant correlation (Spearman rMEP: 0.264), driven by detectable levels of MEP in only 3% of the amniotic fluid samples. In general, the included parabens, phenols and phthalates were effectively metabolized and excreted via the urine, which was the matrix that reflected the highest detectable levels.

Previous studies on prenatal exposure to Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in mice and humans demonstrated pubertal timing and reproductive performance could be affected in exposed offspring. However, the impacts at the pituitary, specifically regarding signaling pathways engaged and direct effects on the gonadotropins LH and FSH, are unknown. We hypothesized prenatal exposure to DEHP during a critical period of embryonic development (e15.5 to e18.5) will cause sex-specific disruptions in reproduction-related mRNA expression in offspring's pituitary due to interference with androgen and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. We found that prenatal DEHP exposure in vivo caused a significant increase in Fshb specifically in males, while the anti-androgen flutamide caused significant increases in both Lhb and Fshb in males. AhR target gene Cyp1b1 was increased in both sexes in DEHP-exposed offspring. In embryonic pituitary cultures, the DEHP metabolite MEHP increased Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 mRNA in both sexes and Cyp1b1 induction was reduced by co-treatment with AhR antagonist. AhR reporter assay in GHFT1 cells confirmed MEHP can activate AhR signaling. Lhb, Fshb and Gnrhr mRNA were significantly decreased in both sexes by MEHP, but co-treatment with AhR antagonist did not restore mRNA levels in pituitary culture. In summary, our data suggest phthalates can directly affect the function of the pituitary by activating AhR signaling and altering gonadotropin expression.

Cortisol, fluorescence signal, and mRNA levels of eGFP and 11 targeted genes were measured in a homogenized pool of zebrafish larvae, with six experimental replicates for each endpoint. Eleven targeted genes were selected according to their association with stress-axis and immediate early response class of genes.

Similar NPV was observed when the predictive models trained based on the mRNA levels of the eleven assessed genes. Measurement of whole-body fluorescence intensity signal was not significant to detect blunted stress response.

Methods: Exposing female mice to BPA two weeks prior to conception through gestational day 12.5; whereupon fetal placentas were collected, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Small RNAs were isolated and used for small RNA-sequencing. Results: 43 small RNAs were differentially expressed. Target mRNAs were closely aligned to those expressed by thymus and brain, and pathway enrichment analyses indicated that such target mRNAs regulate neurogenesis and associated neurodevelopment processes. Conclusions: BPA induces several small RNAs in mouse placenta that might provide biomarkers for BPA exposure. Further, the placenta might affect fetal brain development through the secretion of miRNAs.",PMC8649984

Unfortunately, conventional methods used in municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWWTPs) are not designed to eliminate PAEs. For this reason, the development of cheap and simple but very effective techniques for the removal of such residues from wastewater is crucial. The main aim of this study was the evaluation of the removal of six selected PAEs: diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP), in real MWWTPs supported by constructed wetlands (MWWTP-CW system). For the first time, the possibility of using three new plants for this purpose, Cyperus papyrus (papyrus), Lysimachia nemorum (yellow pimpernel) and Euonymus europaeus (European spindle), has been presented. For determining the target PAEs in wastewater samples, a method of SPE (Solid-Phase Extraction)-GC-MS(SIM) was developed and validated, and for plant materials, a method of UAE (Ultrasound-Assisted Extraction)-SPE-GC-MS(SIM) was proposed. The obtained data showed that the application of the MWWTP-CW system allows a significant increase in the removal of DEP, DBP, BBP and DEHP from the wastewater stream. Euonymus europaeus was the most effective among the tested plant species for the uptake of analytes (8938 ng × g-1 dry weight), thus, this plant was found to be optimal for supporting conventional MWWTPs.",PMC8621385

Hundreds of P&EDC may reach the environment, hence, there is a need to rank the level of concern of human exposure to these compounds. Thus, this work aimed at setting a priority list of P&EDC in Brazil, by studying their occurrence in raw and drinking water, calculating health guideline values (GV), and estimating the risks of population exposure to water intake. Data on the Brazilian pharmaceutical market as well as published data of the monitoring of Brazilian natural and drinking water have been collected by means of an exhaustive literature review. Furthermore, many foreign data were also collected to enable a comparison of the values found in Brazilian studies. A list of 55 P&EDC that have the potential to be found in Brazilian water is proposed, and for 41 of these a risk assessment was performed by estimating their margin of exposure (ME), by considering their occurrence in drinking water, and guideline values estimated from reported acceptable daily intake (ADI) data. For seven compounds the risk was deemed high (three estrogens and four anti-inflammatories), whereas for another seven compounds, it was regarded as an 'alert' situation. Although such risk analysis is conservative, since it has been calculated based on the highest reported P&EDC concentration in drinking water, it highlights the need to enhance their monitoring in Brazil to strengthen the database and support decision makers. An analysis of the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance agents (antibiotics, resistant bacteria, and resistance genes) in surface waters was also carried out and confirmed that such agents are present in water sources throughout Brazil, which deserves the attention of policy makers and health agents to prevent dissemination of antimicrobial resistance through water use.",PMC8620687

This study examined the association of maternal exposure to benzophenones as one of the EDCs with gestational age and evaluated their effects on birth outcomes including birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and Ponderal Index. We assessed 166 pregnant mothers of the PERSIAN cohort population of Isfahan, Iran, in the 1st and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and their infants at birth. Four common benzophenones (BPs) including 2,4-dihydroxy benzophenone (BP-1), 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (BP-3), 4-hydroxy benzophenone (4-OH-BP), and 2,2'-dihydroxy-4-methoxy benzophenone (BP-8) were measured in maternal urine samples. The median urinary concentrations of 4-OH-BP, BP-3, BP-1, and BP-8 in the 1st trimester were 6.62, 7.5, 4.39, and 1.32 µg/g creatinine and those in the 3rd trimester were 3.15, 16.98, 9.95, and 1.04 µg/g creatinine, respectively. BP-3 was the predominant metabolite in both trimesters. There was a significant correlation between BP-3, BP-1, and 4-OH-BP levels (p < 0.05) but not BP-8. BP-1 showed a significant positive association with gestational age (GA) in all infants in the 1st trimester, but a negative association was observed between BP-3 and BP-1 levels and GA in girls. Classification of infants' birth weight for different GAs represented that the majority of them were appropriate for GA. However, boys' weights were heavier than girls. Also, birth outcomes of preterm (< 37 weeks) infants were noticeably lower than term infants (37-42 weeks). This study demonstrated that benzophenone derivatives especially BP-3 can affect the duration of pregnancy and consequently fetal growth in the early and late stages of pregnancy. This is more pronounced in girls; however, more investigations in a different population are needed to prove the results. Therefore, the application of these compounds as a UV protector requires precise regulation to reduce exposure, especially in pregnant women.",PMC8620316

PCPs contain a number of ingredients, often including a wide range of endocrine disrupting chemicals such as phthalates and parabens. The present study examines the association between self-reported PCP use and prenatal sex-steroids and thyroid hormones levels in women from Puerto Rico. We recruited pregnant women (n = 1070) through the Puerto Rico PROTECT Cohort and collected blood, demographic and pregnancy-related data at recruitment and subsequent visits. PCP use in the 48-h preceding the blood sample was collected through self-reported questionnaires. Nine hormones (corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH], sex-hormone binding globulin [SHBG], estriol [E3], progesterone, testosterone, thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], total triiodothyronine [T3], total thyroxine [T4], and free thyroxine [fT4]) were measured in maternal serum samples at two points during pregnancy. Linear mixed models with random intercepts were used to examine associations between PCP use and serum hormone levels. Use of cosmetics significantly increased with age, household income and education level (p < 0.01). Use of hair products, such as hair dyes and bleach, relaxers, and mousse, was associated with lower levels of all sex steroid hormones compared to non-use: SHBG (%Δ = -7.1, 95%CI: -12.4,-1.8), E3 (%Δ = -23.2, 95%CI: -32.2,-13.0), progesterone (%Δ = -21.5, 95%CI: -29.4,-12.9) and testosterone (%Δ = -21.5, 95%CI: -33.1,-7.8) adjusted for maternal age, education and pre-pregnancy body mass index. Our findings suggest that household income and education level influence PCP use among pregnant women in this study. Use of certain hair products was associated with lower concentrations of sex steroid hormones. Although there are limitations to questionnaire data, characterizing PCP use is inexpensive and may represent exposure from multiple classes of chemicals, including chemicals that may not specifically appear on product labels and/or have not been tested for endocrine disrupting potential, making it a useful complement to chemical biomarker data.",PMC8810700

Exposure to BPA is especially dangerous if it occurs during specific ""critical periods"" of life, when organisms are more sensitive to hormonal changes (i.e., intrauterine, perinatal, juvenile or puberty periods). In this study, we focused on the effects of chronic exposure to BPA in adult female mice starting during pregnancy. Three months old C57BL/6J females were orally exposed to BPA or to vehicle (corn oil). The treatment (4 µg/kg body weight/day) started the day 0 of pregnancy and continued throughout pregnancy, lactation, and lasted for a total of 20 weeks. BPA-treated dams did not show differences in body weight or food intake, but they showed an altered estrous cycle compared to the controls. In order to evidence alterations in social and sociosexual behaviors, we performed the Three-Chamber test for sociability, and analyzed two hypothalamic circuits (well-known targets of endocrine disruption) particularly involved in the control of social behavior: the vasopressin and the oxytocin systems. The test revealed some alterations in the displaying of social behavior: BPA-treated dams have higher locomotor activity compared to the control dams, probably a signal of high level of anxiety. In addition, BPA-treated dams spent more time interacting with no-tester females than with no-tester males. In brain sections, we observed a decrease of vasopressin immunoreactivity (only in the paraventricular and suprachiasmatic nuclei) of BPA-treated females, while we did not find any alteration of the oxytocin system. In parallel, we have also observed, in the same hypothalamic nuclei, a significant reduction of the membrane estrogen receptor GPER1 expression.",PMC8607277

We aimed to evaluate the relationship of phthalate metabolites with thyroid function and thyroid homeostasis parameters in type 2 diabetes and to explore whether thyroid autoimmunity status and metformin, the most common antidiabetic drug, may influence such associations. Concurrent urine and blood samples were collected from 639 participants with type 2 diabetes in the METAL (Environmental Pollutant Exposure and Metabolic Diseases in Shanghai) study. We measured urinary concentrations of thirteen phthalate metabolites along with serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), total T4 and T3, free T4 (FT4) and T3 (FT3), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb). Four parameters of thyroid homeostasis, including the sum activity of step-up deiodinases (SPINA-GD), thyroid secretory capacity (SPINA-GT), Jostel's TSH index (TSHI), and thyrotroph thyroid hormone resistance index (TTSI), were also calculated. Among all participants, after full adjustment, multivariable regression analysis showed that some urine phthalate metabolites were negatively associated with TSH, TSHI, and TTSI levels and positively associated with FT3, T3, SPINA-GD, and SPINA-GT levels. None of the urine phthalate metabolites exhibited a significant association with thyroid autoimmunity. The associations of phthalate metabolites with thyroid function and thyroid homeostasis parameters differed based on thyroid autoantibody and metformin treatment status.

Exposure to specific EDCs can increase the risk of CAKUT and no association with hypospadias was observed. Previous studies showed an association between maternal occupational exposure to EDCs and hypospadias. However, little is known about the effect of these chemicals on the development of CAKUT, especially subgroups of urinary tract anomalies. For this case-control study, cases with urogenital anomalies from the European Concerted Action on Congenital Anomalies and Twins Northern Netherlands (Eurocat NNL) registry and non-malformed controls from the Lifelines children cohort (living in the same catchment region as Eurocat NNL) born between 1997 and 2013 were selected. This study included 530 cases with CAKUT, 364 cases with hypospadias, 7 cases with both a urinary tract anomaly and hypospadias and 5602 non-malformed controls. Cases with a genetic or chromosomal anomaly were excluded, and to avoid genetic correlation, we also excluded cases in which a sibling with the same defect was included. Information on maternal occupation held early in pregnancy was collected via self-administered questionnaires. Job titles were translated into occupational exposure to EDCs using a job-exposure matrix (JEM). Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs were estimated to assess the association between maternal occupational exposure to EDCs (and to specific types of EDCs) and CAKUT and hypospadias. For CAKUT and hypospadias, 23.1% and 22.9% of the cases were exposed to EDCs, respectively, whereas 19.8% of the controls were exposed. We found an association between maternal occupational exposure to organic solvents/alkylphenolic compounds and CAKUT (aOR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01-1.97) that became stronger when combinations of urinary tract anomalies co-occurred with other defects (aOR 7.51, 95% CI 2.41-23.43). An association was also observed for exposure to phthalates/benzophenones/parabens/siloxanes and CAKUT (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.06-2.29), specifically urinary collecting system anomalies (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.03-2.54) and combinations of urinary tract anomalies (aOR 2.90, 95% CI 1.09-7.71). We observed no association between EDC exposure and hypospadias. The different study designs of Eurocat NNL and Lifelines could have introduced differential information bias. Also, exposure misclassification could be an issue: it is possible that the actual exposure differed from the exposure estimated by the JEM. In addition, women could also have been exposed to other exposures not included in the analysis, which could have resulted in residual confounding by co-exposures. Women, their healthcare providers, and their employers need to be aware that occupational exposure to specific EDCs early in pregnancy may be associated with CAKUT in their offspring. An occupational hygienist should be consulted in order to take exposure to those specific EDCs into consideration when risk assessments are carried out at the workplace.

Recently, we unveiled that in the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor agonist G-1 (G1) and the endocrine disruptor 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) are potent modulators in polyreactive antibody production. However, the integral role of the microbiota upon immunity and antibody processing in response to the effect of EE2 remains largely unexplored. Here, juvenile seabreams continuously exposed for 84 days to oral G1 or EE2 mixed in the fish food were intraperitoneally (i.p.) immune primed on day 42 with the model antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). A critical panel of systemic and mucosal immune markers, serum VTG, and humoral, enzymatic, and bacteriolytic activities were recorded and correlated with gut bacterial metagenomic analysis 1 day post-priming (dpp). Besides, at 15 dpp, animals received a boost to investigate the possible generation of specific anti-KLH antibodies at the systemic and mucosal interphases by the end of the trial. On day 43, EE2 but not G1 induced a significant shift in the serum VTG level of naive fish. Simultaneously, significant changes in some immune enzymatic activities in the serum and gut mucus of the EE2-treated group were recorded. In comparison, the vaccine priming immunization resulted in an attenuated profile of most enzymatic activities in the same group. The gut genes qPCR analysis exhibited a related pattern, only emphasized by a significant shift in the EE2 group's il1b expression. The gut bacterial microbiome status underwent 16S rRNA dynamic changes in alpha diversity indices, only with the exposure to oral G1, supporting functional alterations on cellular processes, signaling, and lipid metabolism in the microbiota. By the same token, the immunization elevated the relative abundance of Fusobacteria only in the control group, while this phylum was depleted in both the treated groups. Remarkably, the immunization also promoted changes in the bacterial class Betaproteobacteria and the estrogen-associated genus Novosphingobium. Furthermore, systemic and mucosal KLH-specific immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgT levels in the fully vaccinated fish showed only slight changes 84 days post-estrogenic oral administration. In summary, our results highlight the intrinsic relationship among estrogens, their associated receptors, and immunization in the ubiquitous fish immune regulation and the subtle but significant crosstalk with the gut endobolome.",PMC8551918

An analysis of the underlying mechanism revealed that MEHP promotes increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reducing the activity of superoxide dismutase in all lineages, possibly via its actions at the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This leads to a metabolic shift away from glycolysis toward the pentose phosphate pathway and ultimately results in the death of hematopoietic cells that rely on glycolysis for energy production. By contrast, cells that utilize fatty acid oxidation for energy production are not susceptible to this outcome due to their capacity to uncouple ATP production.

Among them were genes involved in cuticle metabolism, muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and gametogenesis, whose mis-regulation could lead to moult, locomotor, and reproductive impairments. Furthermore, genes involved in epigenetic processes were found in both sexes, which highlights the potential impact of exposure to TEB on future generations.

In addition, aggregated chemicals showed an adverse effect although individual concentration was at a low level. However, most studies between bisphenols and birth outcomes have focused on the effect of individual bisphenol. Thus, we explored the associations of urinary bisphenol mixtures with birth outcomes. We conducted a prospective birth cohort study in South Korea. One hundred eighty mother-infant pairs were recruited from 2017 to 2019. Bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol S (BPS) in one spot urine were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We used two statistical approaches to examine potential associations of BPA, BPF, and BPS with birth weight and gestational age: (1) multivariable linear regression; (2) Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). The geometric means of BPA, BPF, and BPS were 2.1, 0.2, and 0.1 μg/L, respectively. In stratified linear analyses by each median value, a higher BPF was positively associated with birth weight (g) (β = 125.5; 95% CI: 45.0 to 205.9). Mixture analyses using BKMR suggested an inverse association between bisphenol mixtures and birth weight. Our findings suggest that in utero bisphenol exposure may influence birth weight and that such relationships may differ considering non-linearity and the combined effect.",PMC8508042

Understanding biological mechanisms underlying timing of labor, including endocrine disruption, can inform prevention efforts. Gestational hormones were measured among 976 women in PROTECT, a longitudinal birth cohort in Puerto Rico. We evaluated associations between hormone concentrations at 18 and 26 weeks gestation and gestational age at birth, while assessing effect modification by fetal sex. Exploratory analyses assessed binary outcomes of overall preterm birth (PTB, <37 weeks gestation) and the spontaneous PTB subtype, defined as preterm premature rupture of membranes, spontaneous preterm labor, or both. Multivariable logistic and linear regressions were fit using visit-specific hormone concentrations, and fetal sex-specific effects were estimated using interaction terms. Main outcome models were adjusted for maternal age, education, marital status, alcohol consumption, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Exploratory models adjusted for maternal age and education. We observed reduced gestational age at birth with higher circulating CRH (β: -2.73 days, 95% CI: -4.97, -0.42), progesterone (β: -4.90 days, 95% CI: -7.07, -2.73), and fT4 concentrations (β: -2.73 days, 95% CI: -4.76, -0.70) at 18 weeks specifically among male fetuses. Greater odds of overall and spontaneous PTB were observed among males with higher CRH, estriol, progesterone, total triiodothyronine (T3), and free thyroxine (fT4) concentrations. Greater odds of PTB among females was observed with higher testosterone concentrations.

In previous studies, an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture was shown to affect female reproduction in a transgenerational manner. However, limited information was available on the effect of phthalate mixtures on ovarian steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis. Ovarian steroidogenesis is important for producing hormones needed for reproduction and ovarian regulation, and folliculogenesis is essential for the development of ovarian follicles and successful fertility. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture adversely affects ovarian steroidogenesis and folliculogenesis in the F1 generation of adult female mice. Pregnant dams (F0 generation) were orally dosed with vehicle control or a phthalate mixture (20 μg/kg/day-500 mg/kg/day) daily from gestational day 10 to birth, and the adult F1 females were the offspring of the dosed dams. The ovaries of the F1 generation were collected at postnatal day 60. One ovary was used for histological examination of the numbers and percent of different follicle types. The other ovary was used to measure expression of theca and granulosa cell enzymes. Additionally, sera were collected for measuring hormone levels. The results indicate that prenatal exposure to the phthalate mixture decreases hormone levels and gene expression, alters the transitioning of follicle types, and leads to a higher incidence of atresia in the F1 generation offspring.",PMC8643306

Considerable attention has been paid to their biological effects especially in women of childbearing age or during pregnancy as EDCs have been reported to cross the placenta becoming concentrated in the fetus' circulation. Lifestyle habits, daily consumption of packaged foods and use of healthcare/cosmetic products are associated with increased EDCs levels. This cross-sectional research examined the EDCs levels and the lifestyle determinants of EDC exposure in a cohort of reproductive-age women from Northern Italy. Methods: Forty-five women (median age: 36, IQR: 30-38) were evaluated for urinary bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates levels and also studied for EDCs' major determinants of daily exposure; food frequency/dietary, physical activity, smoking habits and weight status. Results: Although 100% of women seemed to have been exposed to common sources of EDCs, they reported a healthy lifestyle. The multivariable model described a positive and significant association between consumption of sauces/dressings in plastic containers and monoethyl phthalate exposure (p = 0.037).

Thirty-five healthy adult male mice were randomly divided to five groups; normal saline receiving group, DEHP (2 g/kg/day, dissolved in corn oil, p.o.) receiving group, DEHP (2 g/kg/day, dissolved in corn oil, p.o.) and EA receiving groups (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Treatment duration of animals was 14 days. Body and testes weights and sperm characteristics and histological changes of testes were evaluated. Serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were analyzed. In the testicular tissue, oxidative/nitrosative stress markers and inflammatory cytokine levels were measured. Ellagic acid significantly reduced DEHP-induced reduction of body and testes weights. The DEHP-induced reduction of spermatogonia, primary spermatocyte and sertoli cells numbers as well as reduction of sperm vitality and progressive motility were reversed by EA. Furthermore, EA inhibited DEHP-induced alterations in serum hormone levels. These effects were associated with the reduction of DEHP-induced increased level of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Ellagic acid considerably inhibits testicular toxicity of DEHP through reducing oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory responses.

In 142 mother-infant pairs from the Duisburg Birth Cohort Study, PCBs and PCDD/Fs levels were quantified from maternal blood during late pregnancy and associated with DNAm levels in cord blood using the Illumina EPIC beadchip.

DMPs and DMRs mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, gene regulation, and immune functioning. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) showed 31 co-methylated modules (FDRs < 0.05) associated with one congener of PCDF levels in females. Results of both analytical strategies indicate that prenatal exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is associated with altered DNAm of genes involved in neurodevelopment, gene expression and immune functioning.

So far, BPA toxicity has been largely investigated on different biological processes, from reproduction to development, immune system, and metabolism. In zebrafish, Danio rerio, previous studies revealed the ability of environmentally relevant concentrations of this contaminant to significantly impair fertility via epigenetic modification. In addition, several studies demonstrated the ability of different probiotic strains to improve organism health. This study provides information on the role of the probiotic mixture SLAb51 to counteract adverse BPA effects on reproduction. A 28-day trial was set up with different experimental groups: BPA, exposed to 10 µg/L BPA; P, receiving a dietary supplementation of SLAb51 at a final concentration of 109 CFU/g; BPA+P exposed to 10 µg/L BPA and receiving SLAb51 at a final concentration of 109 CFU/g and a C group. Since oocyte growth and maturation represent key aspects for fertility in females, studies were performed on isolated class III (vitellogenic) and IV (in maturation) follicles and liver, with emphasis on the modulation of the different vitellogenin isoforms. In males, key signals regulating spermatogenesis were investigated. Results demonstrated that in fish exposed to the combination of BPA and probiotic, most of the transcripts were closer to C or P levels, supporting the hypothesis of SLAb51 to antagonize BPA toxicity.

The ECHO PATHWAYs consortium quantified 21 urinary phthalate metabolites from 760 women enrolled in the CANDLE study (Shelby County, TN) using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Placental transcriptomic data were obtained using paired-end RNA sequencing. Linear models were fitted to estimate separate associations between maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentration during the second and third trimester and placental gene expression at birth, adjusted for confounding variables. Genes were considered differentially expressed at a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.05. Associations between phthalate metabolites and biological pathways were identified using self-contained gene set testing and considered significantly altered with an FDR-adjusted p<0.2. We observed significant associations between second-trimester phthalate metabolites mono (carboxyisooctyl) phthalate (MCIOP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate, and mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate and 18 genes in total, including four lncRNAs. Specifically, placental expression of NEAT1 was associated with multiple phthalate metabolites. Third-trimester MCIOP and mono-isobutyl phthalate concentrations were significantly associated with placental expression of 18 genes and two genes, respectively. Expression of genes within 27 biological pathways was associated with mono-methyl phthalate, MCIOP, and monoethyl phthalate concentrations. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide assessment of the relationship between the placental transcriptome at birth and prenatal phthalate exposure in a large and diverse birth cohort.

The results indicated exposures resulted in different impacts on T-cell populations in each disease model. Furthermore, the consequences of exposure differed between female and male mice. Notably, exposure to the chemical mixture significantly increased EAE disease severity in females, but not in male, mice. These findings indicated that direct exposure to this mixture leads to multiple alterations in T-cell subsets and that these alterations differ between sexes.

Concern is growing about the consequences of perinatal EDC exposure on disease predisposition later in life. Metabolomics are promising approaches for studying long-term consequences of early life EDC exposure. These approaches allow for the identification and characterization of biomarkers of direct or ancestral exposures that could be diagnostic for individual susceptibility to disease and help to understand mechanisms through which EDCs act. We sought to identify metabolomic fingerprints in mice ancestrally exposed to the model obesogen tributyltin (TBT), to assess whether metabolomics could discriminate potential trans-generational susceptibility to obesity and recognize metabolic pathways modulated by ancestral TBT exposure. We used non-targeted 1H NMR metabolomic analyses of plasma and liver samples collected from male and female mice ancestrally exposed to TBT in two independent transgenerational experiments in which F3 and F4 males became obese when challenged with increased dietary fat. Metabolomics confirmed transgenerational obesogenic effects of environmentally relevant doses of TBT in F3 and F4 males, in two independent studies. Although females never became obese, their specific metabolomic fingerprint evidenced distinct transgenerational effects of TBT in female mice consistent with impaired capacity for liver biotransformation. This study is the first application of metabolomics to unveil the transgenerational effects of EDC exposure. Very early, significant changes in the plasma metabolome were observed in animals ancestrally exposed to TBT. These changes preceded the onset of obesogenic effects elicited by increased dietary fat in the TBT groups, and which ultimately resulted in significant changes in the liver metabolome. Development of metabolomic fingerprints could facilitate the identification of individuals carrying the signature of ancestral obesogen exposure that might increase their susceptibility to other risk factor such as increased dietary fat.",PMC8919592

The purpose of the present study was to explore whether selenium status may augment arsenic's effects during chronic arsenic exposure. To test this possibility, mice were exposed to arsenic in their drinking water and provided ad libitum access to either a diet replete with selenium (Control) or deficient in selenium (SelD). Arsenic significantly improved glucose tolerance and decreased insulin secretion and β-cell function in vivo.

Perinatal development is a critical window for altered, lifelong health trajectory, and evidence supports the role of perinatal programming in chronic metabolic diseases. To examine the impact of diet and bisphenol A (BPA) on the developmental trajectory of NAFLD in offspring, we exposed dams from pre-gestation through lactation to a human-relevant dose of oral BPA coupled with intake of high fat Western or Mediterranean-style diets. We assessed hepatic steatosis by quantifying hepatic triglycerides (TGs) and metabolic health by measuring body weight, relative organ weights, and serum hormone levels in dams and offspring at postnatal day 10 (PND10) and 10-months of age. In dams, consumption of the Western or Mediterranean diet increased hepatic TGs 1.7-2.4-fold, independent of BPA intake. Among offspring, both perinatal diet and BPA exposure had a greater impact on metabolic outcomes than on hepatic steatosis. At PND10, serum leptin levels were elevated 2.6-4.8-fold in pups exposed to the Mediterranean diet, with a trend for sex-specific effects on body and organ weights. At 10-months, sex-specific increases in organ weight and hormone levels were observed in mice perinatally exposed to Western + BPA or Mediterranean + BPA. These findings suggest lifestage-specific interaction of perinatal exposures to experimental diets and BPA on offspring metabolic health without effects on NAFLD later in life.

Following treatment, ovaries, testes, and sera were harvested for histological assessment and measurement of steroid hormone levels. In male piglets, progesterone and pregnenolone levels were significantly lower in both treatment groups compared to control, whereas in female piglets, progesterone was significantly higher in the 20 mg group compared to control, indicating sex-specific effects in a non-monotonic manner. Follicle numbers and gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes and apoptotic factors were not altered in treated ovaries compared to controls. In DEHP-treated testes, germ cell migration was impaired and germ cell death was significantly increased compared to controls. Overall, the results of this study suggest that neonatal exposure to DEHP in pigs leads to sex-specific disruption of the reproductive system.",PMC8511162

EDC exposure during critical windows of development may interfere with the body's endocrine system, affecting growth. Previous human studies have examined one EDC at a time in relation to infant growth. By studying mixtures, the human experience can be better approximated. We investigated the association of prenatal exposure to persistent EDCs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)) as mixtures with postnatal body size among female offspring. We used a sub-sample of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N = 425), based in the United Kingdom. We quantified 52 EDCs in maternal serum collected during pregnancy. We used Bayesian kernel machine regression with a random intercept to examine the association of prenatal concentrations of EDC mixtures with longitudinal postnatal body size measures for each EDC class separately (PFAS, PCBs, and OCPs) and for all three classes combined. Weight and height measures at 0, 2, 9, and 19 months were obtained by health professionals as part of routine child health surveillance. The mixture representing all three classes combined (31 chemicals) (n = 301) was inversely associated with postnatal body size. Holding all EDCs in the 31-chemical mixture at the 75th percentile compared to the 50th percentile was associated with 0.15 lower weight-for-age z-score (95% credible interval -0.26, -0.03). Weak inverse associations were also seen for height-for-age and body mass index-for-age scores. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to mixtures of persistent EDCs may affect postnatal body size.",PMC8464514

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has validated several EDC-receptor bioassays to detect endocrine active chemicals and has established guidelines for regulatory testing of EDCs. Focus on testing over the past decade has been initially directed to EATS modalities (estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and steroidogenesis) and validated tests for chemicals that exert effects through non-EATS modalities are less established. Due to recognition that EDCs are vast in their mechanisms of action, novel bioassays are needed to capture the full scope of activity. Here, we highlight the need for validated assays that detect non-EATS modalities and discuss major international efforts underway to develop such tools for regulatory purposes, focusing on non-EATS modalities of high concern (i.e., retinoic acid, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and glucocorticoid signaling). Two case studies are presented with strong evidence amongst animals and human studies for non-EATS disruption and associations with wildlife and human disease. This includes metabolic syndrome and insulin signaling (case study 1) and chemicals that impact the cardiovascular system (case study 2). This is relevant as obesity and cardiovascular disease represent two of the most significant health-related crises of our time. Lastly, emerging topics related to EDCs are discussed, including recognition of crosstalk between the EATS and non-EATS axis, complex mixtures containing a variety of EDCs, adverse outcome pathways for chemicals acting through non-EATS mechanisms, and novel models for testing chemicals. Recommendations and considerations for evaluating non-EATS modalities are proposed. Moving forward, improved understanding of the non-EATS modalities will lead to integrated testing strategies that can be used in regulatory bodies to protect environmental, animal, and human health from harmful environmental chemicals.",PMC8669078

Although the neuroendocrine control of sexual maturation is a major target of EDCs, little is known about the potential role of the hypothalamus in puberty and ovulation disruption transmitted across generations. We hypothesized that developmental exposure to an environmentally relevant dose of EDC mixture could induce multi- and/or transgenerational alterations of sexual maturation and maternal care in female rats through epigenetic reprograming of the hypothalamus. We investigated the transmission of a disrupted reproductive phenotype via the maternal germline or via nongenomic mechanisms involving maternal care. Adult female Wistar rats were exposed prior to and during gestation and until the end of lactation to a mixture of the following 13 EDCs: di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), bisphenol A (BPA), vinclozolin, prochloraz, procymidone, linuron, epoxynaxole, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, octyl methoxynimmate, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), butylparaben, and acetaminophen. Perinatally exposed offspring (F1) were mated with unexposed males to generate germ cell (F2) and transgenerationally exposed (F3 and F4) females. Sexual maturation, maternal behavior, and hypothalamic targets of exposure were studied across generations. Germ cell (F2) and transgenerationally (F3) EDC-exposed females, but not F1, displayed delayed pubertal onset and altered folliculogenesis. We reported a transgenerational alteration of key hypothalamic genes controlling puberty and ovulation (Kiss1, Esr1, and Oxt), and we identified the hypothalamic polycomb group of epigenetic repressors as actors of this mechanism. Furthermore, we found a multigenerational reduction of maternal behavior (F1-F3) induced by a loss in hypothalamic dopaminergic signaling. Using a cross-fostering paradigm, we identified that the reduction in maternal phenotype was normalized in EDC-exposed pups raised by unexposed dams, but no reversal of the pubertal phenotype was achieved. Rats developmentally exposed to an EDC mixture exhibited multi- and transgenerational disruption of sexual maturation and maternal care via hypothalamic epigenetic reprogramming. These results raise concerns about the impact of EDC mixtures on future generations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8795.",PMC8360047

Our objective was to investigate whether urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were associated with pre-ovulatory follicular fluid (FF) anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations in women undergoing fertility treatment. This cross-sectional analysis included 138 women with urinary phthalate data available in the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study (2010-2016) in whom FF AMH concentrations were quantified using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We also quantified 8 phthalate metabolite concentrations using tandem mass spectrometry in 1-2 urine samples per cycle (total 331 urines) and calculated the cycle-specific geometric mean for each metabolite. We applied cluster-weighted generalized estimating equation models (CWGEE) to evaluate the associations of tertiles of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations with log-transformed FF AMH concentrations adjusting for potential confounders. Study participants had median age of 34.0 years (IQR 32.0, 37.0), 83% were white, and median BMI of 23.1 kg/m2 (IQR 21.2, 26.1). The following stimulation protocols were used: luteal phase agonist (70%), antagonist (14%), or flare (16%). Urinary concentrations of select phthalate metabolites were negatively associated with FF AMH. For example, women whose urinary mEOHP was in the lowest tertile (range 0.30-4.04 ng/ml) had an adjusted mean FF AMH of 0.72 ng/mL (95% CI = 0.36, 1.44), compared to women in the highest tertile (range 9.90-235), who had an adjusted mean of 0.24 ng/mL (95% CI = 0.12-0.48, p < 0.05).

A total of 25 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. Eleven of them failed to show a clear relationship between BPA and abnormal fetal growth. The majority of the remaining studies (9/14) found an inverse association of BPA with indicators of fetal growth, whereas three studies suggested increased fetal growth, and two studies produced contradictory findings. Of note, both of the studies that collected a sample (amniotic fluid) directly reflecting BPA concentration in the fetus during the first half of pregnancy revealed an inverse association with birth weight.

Growing epidemiological evidence suggests that PBDEs alter cardiovascular function. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of BDE-47 on adrenal corticosteroid pathways that play vital roles in cardiovascular homeostasis and pathophysiology. The effect of BDE-47 on aldosterone and cortisol secretion was characterized in a human adrenocortical cell line. HAC15 cells were exposed to various concentrations of BDE-47 (1 nM to 100 μM). Cell viability, corticosteroid secretion, gene expression of enzymes involved in corticosteroid synthesis, and metabolic activity was examined. Additionally, Sprague Dawley male rats were orally exposed to BDE-47 (10 or 100 µg/kg), 5 days per week for 16 weeks. Organ weights and plasma corticosteroid levels were measured. In HAC15 cells, basal and stimulated aldosterone and cortisol secretion was significantly increased by BDE-47. Gene expression of several enzymes involved in corticosteroid synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism also increased. In Sprague Dawley rats, adrenal but not heart, kidney, or liver weights, were significantly increased in BDE-47 treatment groups. Plasma corticosterone levels were significantly increased in the 100 µg BDE-47/kg treatment group. No change in plasma aldosterone levels were observed with BDE-47 exposure. These data indicate that BDE-47 disrupts the regulation of corticosteroid secretion and provides further evidence that PBDEs are potential endocrine disruptors.

Preliminary evidence revealed that in women undergoing IVF treatment, urinary BPA levels were associated with low serum anti-Mullerian hormone, however a definitive relationship between the two has not yet been characterized. This study aimed to evaluate BPA and BPS effects on in vitro oocyte maturation and early preimplantation embryo development through i) analysis of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and anti-Mullerian hormone receptor II (AMHRII), ii) investigation of developmental parameters, such as cleavage, blastocyst rates and developmental arrest, iii) detection of apoptosis and iv) assessment of possible sex ratio skew. An in vitro bovine model was used as a translational model for human early embryonic development. We first assessed AMH and AMHRII levels after bisphenol exposure during oocyte maturation. Zygotes were also analyzed during cleavage and blastocysts stages. Techniques used include in vitro fertilization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blotting, TUNEL and immunofluorescence. Our findings show that BPA significantly decreased cleavage (p < 0.001), blastocyst (p < 0.005) and overall developmental rates as well as significantly increased embryonic arrest at the 2-4 cell stage (p < 0.05). Additionally, both BPA and BPS significantly increased DNA fragmentation in 2-4 cells, 8-16 cells and blastocyst embryos (p < 0.05). Furthermore, BPA and BPS alter AMH and AMHRII at the mRNA and protein level in both oocytes and blastocysts. BPA, but not BPS, also significantly skews sex ratios towards female blastocysts (p < 0.05). This study shows that BPA affects AMH and AMHRII expression during oocyte maturation and that BPS exerts its effects to a greater extent after fertilization and therefore may not be a safer alternative to BPA.

Glyphosate and its primary degradation product [aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA)] were measured in urine samples collected during the second trimester from 163 pregnant women: 69 preterm births (<37 weeks) and 94 term births, the latter randomly selected as a subset of TIDES term births. We examined the relationship between exposure and length of gestation using multivariable logistic regression models (dichotomous outcome; term versus preterm) and with weighted time-to-event Cox proportional hazards models (gestational age in days). We conducted these analyses in the overall sample and secondarily, restricted to women with spontaneous deliveries (n = 90). Glyphosate and AMPA were detected in most urine samples (>94 %).

Using a recently identified repertoire of VM-IAPs, we assessed the epigenetic effects of different environmental contexts. A longitudinal aging analysis indicated that VM-IAPs are stable across the murine lifespan, with only small increases in DNA methylation detected for a subset of loci. No significant effects were observed after maternal exposure to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A, an obesogenic diet or methyl donor supplementation.

Therefore, the objective of this pilot study was to estimate associations of prenatal hair product use with gestational age at delivery in a Boston, Massachusetts area pregnancy cohort. The study population consisted of a subset of participants enrolled in the Environmental Reproductive and Glucose Outcomes (ERGO) Study between 2018 and 2020. We collected self-reported data on demographics and hair product use using a previously validated questionnaire at four prenatal visits (median: 12, 19, 26, 36 weeks' gestation) and abstracted gestational age at delivery from medical records. We compared gestational age and hair product use by race/ethnicity and used linear regression to estimate covariate-adjusted associations of product use and frequency of use at each study visit with gestational age at delivery. Primary models were adjusted for maternal age at enrollment and delivery method. Of the 154 study participants, 7% delivered preterm. Non-Hispanic Black participants had lower mean gestational age at delivery compared to non-Hispanic White participants (38.2 vs. 39.2 weeks) and were more likely to report ever and more frequent use of hair products.

Different jurisdictions are applying distinct approaches. However, all share a common theme requiring testing for endocrine activity and adverse effects, typically involving in vitro and in vivo assays on selected endocrine pathways. For ecotoxicological evaluation, in vivo assays can be performed across various animal species, including mammals, amphibians, and fish. Results indicating activity (i.e., that a test substance may interact with the endocrine system) from in vivo screens usually trigger further higher-tier in vivo assays. Higher-tier assays provide data on adverse effects on relevant endpoints over more extensive parts of the organism's life cycle. Both in vivo screening and higher-tier assays are animal- and resource-intensive and can be technically challenging to conduct. Testing large numbers of chemicals will inevitably result in the use of large numbers of animals, contradicting stipulations set out within many regulatory frameworks that animal studies be conducted as a last resort. Improved strategies are urgently required.

34212583,"Yiqing Zhang, Shanshan Guo, Qian Sun",[Research progress on lyophilization for pretreatment of emerging organic contaminants in environmental samples].,2021,"With rapid urbanization, increasing amounts of chemicals are being used in our daily life. Emerging organic contaminants are a large class of chemicals that are widely detected in the environment. They include pharmaceuticals and personal care products, pesticides, perfluorinated compounds, and endocrine-disrupting compounds. Recently, many countries have reported the occurrence of emerging organic contaminants. In addition, emerging organic contaminants are frequently detected in various environmental samples, including river and lake water samples. Despite their low concentrations in the environment, emerging organic contaminants are potential risks to humans and wildlife. Because they could lead to endocrine disrupting effects and the occurrence of resistance genes. Thus, the detection of emerging organic contaminants in the environment is imperative for ecological systems and human health. The recent development of analytical techniques has led to the identification of more emerging organic contaminants in the environment. At present, the commonly used chromatographic separation techniques include liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. For the identification and quantitation of emerging organic contaminants, chromatography is usually combined with spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. The concentrations of emerging organic contaminants are not sufficiently high to be detected directly, and the matrix is complex in environmental samples. Emerging organic contaminants also have diverse properties. Thus, environmental samples must be pretreated before detection. Pretreatment includes the concentration and purification of the environmental samples. The commonly used pretreatment methods are ultrasound-assisted extraction, QuEChERS, liquid-liquid extraction, and solid-phase extraction. With the development of pretreatment methods, solid-phase microextraction and stirred-bar adsorption extraction have also become popular. These sample pretreatment methods have many advantages such as good efficiency and effectivity for recycling target compounds. Hence, they are widely used. However, these methods are time-consuming, in addition to requiring expensive consumables and large amounts of organic solvents. Lyophilization is a technique used for product dehydration, preservation, and storage in the agricultural and food industries. It is also occasionally used to simplify the extraction procedure for drug residue analysis. There are three stages of lyophilization: freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. Lyophilization has many advantages when used for pretreatment, namely, operational simplicity, less consumables, less sample volume, prolonged storage, and minimal sample loss. Lyophilization is thus an alternative method for the pretreatment of emerging organic contaminants in environmental samples. Recently, lyophilization has been applied to the pretreatment of emerging organic contaminants in environmental water samples. In general, a few steps were included during sample analysis. First, the samples were pretreated and frozen before the primary drying stage. After lyophilization, the analytes were extracted using a small amount of organic solvent and dried with nitrogen. Consequently, the elution was reconstructed and detected after dryness and filtration. Many groups of emerging organic contaminants could be recovered, including antibiotics, pesticides, and endocrine-disrupting compounds. The lyophilization could be automated, so that minimal manual intervention was required. By adopting lyophilization, good recoveries and accuracies were achieved. A few cleanup processes were conducted, and a small amount of organic solvent was consumed. Thus, lyophilization is a highly prospective pretreatment method for monitoring emerging organic contaminants, and can be extended to a diverse range of these contaminants. For large-scale and high-frequency sampling campaigns, cheap and convenient pretreatment is urgently needed. In this study, typical emerging organic contaminants are described, along with the universal types of such contaminants and the principles of lyophilization. The application of lyophilization to the detection of emerging organic contaminants in the environment is also introduced. The future of lyophilization is discussed, which provides a reference for emerging contaminant detection in environmental samples.",PMC9404103

The impact of low-dose exposure to DDT on the morphogenesis of the adrenal gland is still poorly understood.

The aim of the study was to investigate the morphogenesis and function of rat adrenal zona glomerulosa in rats exposed to low doses of DDT during prenatal and postnatal development and to determine the possible role of Oct4 in DDT-mediated structural and functional changes. The DDT-exposed rats demonstrated slower development and lower functional activity of the zona glomerulosa during the pubertal period associated with higher expression of Oct4. Further, accelerated growth and restoration of hormone production was associated with, firstly, a decrease in Oct4 expressing cells and secondly, the loss of the inverse relationship between basal aldosterone levels and the number of Oct4 expressing cells. Thus, the transcriptional factor Oct4 exhibited an altered pattern of expression in the DDT-exposed rats during postnatal development.

In addition, CdCl2 elicited an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation. A significant increase in GRP78, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related protein, was also observed. Supplementation of quercetin counteracted the growth-inhibiting action of CdCl2 by recovering ERK protein phosphorylation levels, attenuating ROS overproduction, decreasing MDA content and reducing the expression of GRP78 in cells exposed to CdCl2. Thus, in addition to revealing the molecular effects involved in cadmium-induced toxicity, the present study demonstrated, for the first time, a protective effect of quercetin against cadmium-induced damages to normal thyroid cells.",PMC8268548

A typical environmental estrogen, diethylstilbestrol (DES), can affect normal sexual function and organism development. However, even though the effects of different exposure stages of DES on the endocrine system and gonadal development of zebrafish juveniles are unknown, sex determination is strongly influenced by endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). From 10-90 days post fertilization (dpf), juvenile zebrafish were exposed to DES (100 and 1000 ng/L) in three different stages (initial development stage (IDS), 10-25 dpf; gonadal differentiation stage (GDS), 25-45 dpf and gonadal maturity stage (GMS), 45-60 dpf). Compared with that of IDS and GMS, the growth indicators (body length, body weight, and others) decreased significantly at GDS, and the proportion of zebrafish females exposed to 100 ng/L DES was significantly higher (by 59.65%) than that of the control; in addition, the zebrafish were biased towards female differentiation. The GDS is a critical period for sex differentiation. Our results show that exposure to environmental estrogen during the critical gonadal differentiation period not only affects the development of zebrafish, but also affects the population development.",PMC8301756

In general, phthalates have been used at high concentrations beyond reported environmental levels to assess their adverse effects on fish gonadal physiology. The present study exposed adult female zebrafish to a wide range of DiNP concentrations [0.42 µg L-1 (10-9 M), 4.2 µg L-1 (10-8 M), and 42 µg L-1 (10-7 M)] for 21 days. We evaluated gene expression profiles related to apoptosis, autophagy, and oxidative stress; DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay: terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) and caspase activity (CAS3) were also examined. Exposure to 0.42 and 4.2 µg L-1 upregulated the genes coding for tnfa and baxa, sod1, prkaa1, respectively. CAS3 immunohistochemistry revealed a higher number of positive vitellogenic oocytes in ovaries exposed to 0.42 µg L-1. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between CAS3 signaling and DNA fragmentation. Accordingly, DNA fragmentation was observed in vitellogenic follicles of fish exposed to 0.42 and 4.2 μg L-1.

In this study, we examined joint associations between prenatal exposure to PFAS, PBDEs, and maternal and newborn telomere length using mixture analyses, to characterize effects of cumulative environmental chemical exposures. Study participants were enrolled in the Chemicals in Our Bodies (CIOB) study, a demographically diverse cohort of pregnant people and children in San Francisco, CA. Seven PFAS (ng/mL) and four PBDEs (ng/g lipid) were measured in second trimester maternal serum samples. Telomere length (T/S ratio) was measured in delivery cord blood of 292 newborns and 110 second trimester maternal whole blood samples. Quantile g-computation was used to assess the joint associations between groups of PFAS and PBDEs and newborn and maternal telomere length. Groups considered were: (1) all PFAS and PBDEs combined, (2) PFAS, and (3) PBDEs. Maternal and newborn telomere length were modeled as separate outcomes. T/S ratios in newborn cord and maternal whole blood were moderately correlated (Spearman ρ = 0.31). In mixtures analyses, a simultaneous one quartile increase in all PFAS and PBDEs was associated with a small increase in newborn (mean change per quartile increase = 0.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.03, 0.08) and maternal telomere length (mean change per quartile increase = 0.03 (95% CI = -0.03, 0.09).

This article describes the conduct and results of an international ring trial with 3 EU-NETVAL laboratories and the test method developer. It was organized by EURL ECVAM to validate the method by testing 46 chemicals. A very good reproducibility within and between laboratories was concluded (94.7-100% and 100% concordance of classification) with low within and between laboratory variability (less than 2.5% CV on EC50 values). Moreover, the variability is within the range of other validated, mechanistically similar methods. In comparison to the AR-reference list compiled by ICCVAM, an almost 100% concordance of classifications was obtained. This method allows the detection of the agonist and antagonist properties of a chemical.

They are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with xenoestrogenic activities and affect reproductive success in many ways. It was hypothesized that BPA and BPS could adversely affect the folliculogenesis in chickens due to their disruption of the estrogen responses, using either genomic or non-genomic mechanisms. This study investigated the deleterious effects of BPA and BPS on the ovaries when adult layer chickens were orally treated with these EDCs at 50 μg/kg body weight, the reference dose for chronic oral exposure of BPA established by the U.S. EPA. The chickens in both BPA and BPS-treated groups showed a decreased number of the preovulatory follicles. BPA-treated chickens showed a significant decrease in the diameter of F1. Additionally, both BPA and BPS treatments increased the infiltrations of lymphocytes and plasma cells in ovaries. Moreover, it was found that the ovaries of BPS-treated chickens weighed the most among the groups. RNA sequencing and subsequent pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that both BPA- and BPS-treatment groups showed significant changes in gene expression and pathways related to reproduction, immune function and carcinogenesis. Taken together, both BPA and BPS are potentially carcinogenic and have deleterious effects on the fertility of laying chickens by inducing inflammation, suggesting that BPS may not be a safe replacement for BPA.",PMC8275017

However, it is poorly understood whether the effects of EDCs in invertebrates are mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Previously, we showed that bisphenol A (BPA) affected the physiology of the freshwater oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus. In the present study, we examined the mechanism of the impact of BPA on L. variegatus, using pulse rate of the dorsal blood vessel (DBV) as an endpoint. Both long term and acute exposures to BPA increased the pulsing rate of DBV. The former had a distinct inverted-U dose response relationship with a most efficacious dose of 10-9 M, which increased the pulse rate from 8.97 to 10.9 beats/min. The effects of BPA were mimicked by the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol with a most efficacious dose of 10-12 M. Interestingly E2 had no effect on pulsing rate, either acute or long term. The sensitivity of L. variegatus to estrogens were exquisite, with detectable effects at 10-14 to 10-10 M range. Both the long term and acute effects of BPA were partially or fully blocked by various vertebrate estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists, including ICI 182,780, MPP and G15. Our results suggest that the impact of BPA on pulsing rate of L. variegatus is likely mediated by an estrogenic mechanism instead of general toxicity. The exceptionally high sensitivity of L. variegatus to some estrogens makes it a possible tool for estrogenic EDC screening.",PMC8373826

Dams were exposed to the mixture through the diet at Control, Low or High doses (representing 0x, 5000x and 100 000x human estimated daily intake levels, respectively) from weaning and throughout mating, gestation, and lactation. Perinatally exposed female offspring exhibited altered mammary gland development and a suppressed ovarian follicle maturation. Increased hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymatic activities indirectly indicated activation of nuclear receptors and potential generation of reactive products. Hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed from weaning until 30 weeks of age and could potentially lead to hepatotoxicity.

We illustrate a novel exposure continuum mapping (ECM) framework that combines the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm with generalized additive modeling (GAM) in order to integrate spatially-correlated learning into the study mixtures of environmental chemicals. We demonstrate our method using biomarker data on chemical mixtures collected from a diverse mother-child cohort. We obtained biomarker concentrations for 16 prevalent endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) collected in the first-trimester from a large, ethnically/racially diverse cohort of healthy pregnant women (n = 604) during 2009-2012. This included 4 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 4 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 4 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 4 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). We applied a two-stage exposure continuum mapping (ECM) approach to investigate the combined impact of the EDCs on birth weight. First, we analyzed our EDC data with SOM in order to reduce the dimensionality of our exposure matrix into a two-dimensional grid (i.e., map) where nodes depict the types of EDC mixture profiles observed within our data. We define this map as the 'exposure continuum map', as the gridded surface reflects a continuous sequence of exposure profiles where adjacent nodes are composed of similar mixtures and profiles at more distal nodes are more distinct. Lastly, we used GAM to estimate a joint-dose response based on the coordinates of our ECM in order to capture the relationship between participant location on the ECM and infant birth weight after adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), education, serum cotinine, total plasma lipids, and infant sex. Single chemical regression models were applied to facilitate comparison. We found that an ECM with 36 mixture profiles retained 70% of the total variation in the exposure data. Frequency analysis showed that the most common profiles included relatively low concentrations for most EDCs (~10%) and that profiles with relatively higher concentrations (for single or multiple EDCs) tended to be rarer (~1%) but more distinct. Estimation of a joint-dose response function revealed that lower birth weights mapped to locations where profile compositions were dominated by relatively high PBDEs and select OCPs. Higher birth weights mapped to locations where profiles consisted of higher PCBs. These findings agreed well with results from single chemical models. Findings from our study revealed a wide range of prenatal exposure scenarios and found that combinations exhibiting higher levels of PBDEs were associated with lower birth weight and combinations with higher levels of PCBs and PFAS were associated with increased birth weight. Our ECM approach provides a promising framework for supporting studies of other exposure mixtures.",PMC8403640

Manufacturers have begun using 'BPA-free' alternatives instead of BPA in many consumer products. However, these alternatives have had much less testing and oversight, yet they are already being mass-produced and used across industries from plastics to food-contact coatings. Here, we used human female adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), a type of adult mesenchymal stem cell, to compare the effects of BPA and BPA alternatives on adipogenesis or fat cell development in vitro. We focused on two commonly used BPA replacements, bisphenol AF (BPAF) and tetramethyl bisphenol F (TMBPF; monomer of the new valPure V70 food-contact coating). Human ASCs were differentiated into adipocytes using chemically defined media in the presence of control differentiation media with and without 17β-estradiol (E2; 10 μM), or with increasing doses of BPA (0, 0.1 and 1 μM), BPAF (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 nM), or TMBPF (0, 0.01 and 0.1 μM). After differentiation, the cells were stained and imaged to visualize and quantify the accumulation of lipid vacuoles and number of developing fat cells. Treated cells were also examined for cell viability and apoptosis (programmed cell death) using the respective cellular assays. Similar to E2, BPA at 0.1 μM and BPAF at 0.1 nM, significantly increased adipogenesis and lipid production by 20% compared to control differentiated cells (based on total lipid vacuole number to cell number ratios), whereas higher levels of BPA and BPAF significantly decreased adipogenesis (p < 0.005). All tested doses of TMBPF significantly reduced adipogenesis and lipid production by 30-40%, likely at least partially through toxic effects on stem cells, as viable cell numbers decreased and apoptosis levels increased throughout differentiation. These findings indicate that low, environmentally-relevant doses of BPA, BPAF, and TMBPF have significant effects on fat cell development and lipid accumulation, with TMBPF having non-estrogenic, anti-adipogenic effects. These and other recent results may provide a potential cellular mechanism between exposure to bisphenols and human obesity, and underscore the likely impact of these chemicals on fat development in vivo.",PMC8160667

Since cyclic AMP (cAMP) plays a key role in reproduction, regulation of its synthesis by E2 may be of biological/pathophysiological relevance. Herein, we investigated whether cAMP production in FT cells (FTCs) is regulated by E2 and environmental estrogens (EE's; xenoestrogens and phytoestrogens). Under basal conditions, low levels of extracellular cAMP were detectable in bovine FTCs (epithelial cells and fibroblasts; 1:1 ratio). Treatment of FTCs with forskolin (AC; adenylyl cyclase activator), isoproterenol (β-adrenoceptor agonist) and IBMX (phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor) dramatically (>10 fold) increased cAMP; whereas LRE1 (sAC; soluble AC inhibitor) and 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA; transmembrane AC (tmAC)) inhibitor decreased cAMP. Comparable changes in basal and stimulated intracellular cAMP were also observed. Ro-20-1724 (PDE-IV inhibitor), but not milrinone (PDE-III inhibitor) nor mmIBMX (PDE-I inhibitor), augmented forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels, suggesting that PDE-IV dominates in FTCs. E2 increased cAMP levels and CREB phosphorylation in FTCs, and these effects were mimicked by EE's (genistein, 4-hydroxy-2',4',6'-trichlorobiphenyl, 4-hydroxy-2',4',6'-dichlorobiphenyl). Moreover, the effects of E2 and EE were blocked by the tmAC inhibitor DDA, but not by the ERα/β antagonist ICI182780. Moreover, BAPTA-AM (intracellular-Ca2+ chelator) abrogated the effects of E2, but not genistein, on cAMP suggesting differential involvement of Ca2+. Treatment with non-permeable E2-BSA induced cAMP levels and CREB-phosphorylation; moreover, the stimulatory effects of E2 and EEs on cAMP were blocked by G15, a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) antagonist. E2 and IBMX induced cAMP formation was inhibited by LRE1 and DDA suggesting involvement of both tmAC and sAC. Our results provide the first evidence that in FTCs, E2 and EE's stimulate cAMP synthesis via GPER.

Bisphenol S (BPS) is used in the manufacture of consumer products because of its superior thermal stability and is thought to be a safe replacement chemical for its analog bisphenol A (BPA). However, the safety profile of these compounds alone or in the presence of other EDCs is yet to be fully investigated. Also, the estrogenic chemical 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and a constituent of female oral contraceptives for women, is present in water supplies. To simulate concurrent exposure of the population to chemical mixtures, we investigated the effects of BPA, BPS, EE2, and their combinations on sex steroid secretion in the growing male rat gonad. Prepubertal and pubertal male rats at 21 and 35 days of age were provided test chemicals in drinking water (parts per billion) for 14 days. At termination of exposure, some individual chemical effects were modified by exposure to chemical combinations. Single chemical exposures markedly decreased androgen secretion but their combination (e.g., BPA + BPS + EE2) caused the opposite effect, i.e., increased Leydig cell T secretion. Also, the test chemicals acting alone or in combination increased testicular and Leydig cell 17β-estradiol (E2) secretion. Chemical-induced changes in T and E2 secretion were associated with altered testicular expression of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage (Cyp11a1) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd17β) enzyme protein.

Previous work has shown that prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure disrupts hypothalamic development, reproductive physiology, mate preference behavior, and social behaviors in a sexually dimorphic manner. Based on evidence that EDCs perturb social behaviors in rodents, we examined effects of PCBs on the neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) that are involved in regulating these behaviors. Rats were exposed prenatally (gestational days 16 and 18) to the weakly estrogenic PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (0.5 or 1 mg/kg), to estradiol benzoate (EB, a positive control), or to the vehicle (3% dimethyl sulfoxide). In adult (~P90) brains, we counted immunolabeled oxytocin and vasopressin cell numbers in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus. EDCs did not change absolute numbers of oxytocin or vasopressin cells in either region, although there were some modest shifts in the rostral-caudal distribution. Second, expression of genes for these nonapeptides (Oxt, Avp), their receptors (Oxtr, Avpr1a), and the estrogen receptor beta (Esr2), was determined by qPCR. In the PVN, there were dose-dependent effects of PCBs in males (Oxt, Oxtr), and effects of EB in females (Avp, Esr2). In the SON, Oxt, and Esr2 were affected by treatments in males.

Studies conducted in the late 1980s found evidence of reductions in sex steroid hormone levels in multiple fish species living in the Bay, and increased growth, condition and relative liver weights, with a reduction in internal fat storage, reduced gonadal sizes, delayed sexual maturation, and altered levels of circulating sex steroid hormones in white sucker (Catostomus commersonii). These early studies provided some of the first pieces of evidence of endocrine disruption in wild animals. Studies on white sucker have continued at Jackfish Bay, monitoring fish health after the installation of secondary waste treatment (1989), changes in the pulp bleaching process (1990s), during facility maintenance shutdowns and during a series of facility closures associated with changing ownership (2000s), and were carried through to 2019 resulting in a 30-year study of fish health impacts, endocrine disruption, chemical exposure, and ecosystem recovery. The objective of the present study was to summarize and understand more than 75 physiological, endocrine, chemical and whole organism endpoints that have been studied providing important context for the complexity of endocrine responses, species differences, and challenges with extrapolation. Differences in body size, liver size, gonad size and condition persist, although changes in liver and gonad indices are much smaller than in the early years. Population modeling of the initial reproductive alterations predicted a 30% reduction in the population size, however with improvements over the last couple of decades those population impacts improved considerably. Reflection on these 30 years of detailed studies, on environmental conditions, physiological, and whole organism endpoints, gives insight into the complexity of endocrine responses to environmental change and mitigation.",PMC8101260

Three hormones, estrone, 17β-estradiol and 17α-ethinylestradiol, are of particular concern as they are bioactive at very low concentrations. Current analytical methods are not all sensitive enough for monitoring these substances in water and do not cover mixture effects. Bioassays could complement chemical analysis since they detect the overall effect of complex mixtures. Here, four chemical mixtures and two hormone mixtures were prepared and tested as reference materials together with two environmental water samples by eight laboratories employing nine in vitro and in vivo bioassays covering different steps involved in the estrogenic response. The reference materials included priority substances under the European Water Framework Directive, hormones and other emerging pollutants. Each substance in the mixture was present at its proposed safety limit concentration (EQS) in the European legislation. The in vitro bioassays detected the estrogenic effect of chemical mixtures even when 17β-estradiol was not present but differences in responsiveness were observed. LiBERA was the most responsive, followed by LYES. The additive effect of the hormones was captured by ERα-CALUX, MELN, LYES and LiBERA. Particularly, all in vitro bioassays detected the estrogenic effects in environmental water samples (EEQ values in the range of 0.75-304 × EQS), although the concentrations of hormones were below the limit of quantification in analytical measurements. The present study confirms the applicability of reference materials for estrogenic effects' detection through bioassays and indicates possible methodological drawbacks of some of them that may lead to false negative/positive outcomes. The observed difference in responsiveness among bioassays - based on mixture composition - is probably due to biological differences between them, suggesting that panels of bioassays with different characteristics should be applied according to specific environmental pollution conditions.",PMC8210648

In 2013, in the context of the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program of the USEPA, a Scientific Advisory Panel reviewed the results from 18 studies and recommended changes to the AMA test guideline, including a modification to a fixed-stage design rather than a fixed-time (i.e., 21-d) design. We describe an extended test design for the AMA (or EAMA) that includes thyroid histopathology and time to metamorphosis (Nieuwkoop-Faber [NF] stage 62), to address both the issues with the fixed-time design and the specific question of thyroid-mediated adversity in a shorter assay than the larval amphibian growth and development assay (LAGDA; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development test guideline 241), using fewer animals and resources. A demonstration study was conducted with the EAMA (up to NF stage 58) using sodium perchlorate. Data analyses and interpretation of the fixed-stage design of the EAMA are more straightforward than the fixed-time design because the fixed-stage design avoids confounded morphometric measurements and thyroid histopathology caused by varying developmental stages at test termination. It also results in greater statistical power to detect metamorphic delays than the fixed-time design. By preferentially extending the AMA to NF stage 62, suitable data can be produced to evaluate thyroid-mediated adversity and preclude the need to perform a LAGDA for thyroid mode of action analysis. The LAGDA remains of further interest should investigations of longer term effects related to sexual development modulated though the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis be necessary. However, reproduction assessment or life cycle testing is currently not addressed in the LAGDA study design.

Furthermore, thyroid hormones are fundamental for the fetal development of all organs, including endocrine hormone changes in uterus. Endocrine disrupting chemicals have been shown to have an effect on thyroid hormone homeostasis in newborns, which affects their later development. Few studies have proposed how phthalates could alter thyroid function through several mechanisms and the possible effects on thyroid hormone homeostasis of phthalates on pregnant women. However, the effects of cord blood phthalates and prenatal phthalate exposure on thyroid hormones in newborns remain unclear. We aim to follow up on our previous established subjects and determine the correlation between phthalate exposure and thyroid hormones in pregnant women and newborns. We recruited 61 pregnant women from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of a medical hospital in southern Taiwan and followed up. High performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used to analyze urine samples for five phthalate metabolites. Serum levels of thyroid hormones were analyzed using electrochemoluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) method. We used Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients to evaluate the correlation between each phthalate metabolites in serum and the thyroid hormone levels in fetus and parturient. Finally, multiple logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between hormones and their corresponding phthalate metabolites in cord blood. High MBP in cord blood was correlated with negative cord serum TSH in newborns (r = -0.25, p < 0.06). By using multiple linear regression after adjusting for potential confounders (gestational and maternal age), cord serum MBP levels showed a negative association with cord serum TSH (β = 0.217, p < 0.05), cord serum T4 (β = 1.71, p < 0.05) and cord serum T4 × TSH (β = 42.8, p < 0.05), respectively.

We investigated the combined effect of NP and HFD on the first offspring of rats, and whether this effect can be passed to the next generation and the possible mechanisms involved. Pregnant rats had access to be treated with 5 μg/kg/day NP and normal diet. The first generation rats were given normal diet and HFD on postnatal day 21, respectively. Then the second generation rats started to only receive normal diet without NP or HFD. Body weight, organ coefficient of liver tissues, lipid profile, biochemical indexes and the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, as well as liver histopathology were investigated in male offspring of rats. NP and HFD interaction had significant effect on the birth weight, body weight and liver tissue organ coefficient of first generation male rats. And HFD aggravated abnormal lipid metabolism, even abnormal liver function and liver histopathological damage of first generation male rats produced by the NP. And this effect can be passed on to the second generation rats. HFD also accelerated the mRNA level of fatty acid synthesis genes such as Lpl, Fas, Srebp-1 and Ppar-γ of first generation rats induced by perinatal exposure to NP, even passed on to the second generation of male rats. NP and HFD resulted in synergistical decrease of the protein expression level of ERα in liver tissue in F2 male rats. HFD and NP synergistically accelerated synthesis of fatty acids in liver of male offspring rats through reducing the expression of ERα, which induced abnormal lipid metabolism, abnormal liver function and hepatic steatosis. Moreover, all of these damage passed on to the next generation rats.",PMC8077693

This can potentially be explained by perturbations to establishment of ovarian endocrine function rather than interference with an already established hormone system. In this study we explore if Hedgehog (HH) signaling, a central pathway for correct ovary development, can be disrupted by exposure to HH-disrupting chemicals, using the antifungal itraconazole as model compound. In the mouse Leydig cell line TM3, used as a proxy for ovarian theca cells, itraconazole exposure had a suppressing effect on genes downstream of HH signaling, such as Gli1. Exposing explanted rat ovaries (gestational day 22 or postnatal day 3) to 30 µM itraconazole for 72 h induced significant suppression of genes in the HH signaling pathway with altered Ihh, Gli1, Ptch1, and Smo expression similar to those previously observed in Ihh/Dhh knock-out mice. Exposing rat dams to 50 mg/kg bw/day in the perinatal period did not induce observable changes in the offspring's ovaries. Overall, our results suggest that HH signal disruptors may affect ovary development with potential long-term consequences for female reproductive health. However, potent HH inhibitors would likely cause severe teratogenic effects at doses lower than those causing ovarian dysgenesis, so the concern with respect to reproductive disorder is for the presence of HH disruptors at low concentration in combination with other ovary or endocrine disrupting compounds.",PMC8285011

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of FLC-induced reproductive toxicity on male mice with particular emphasis on the role of autophagy in mice' TM4 Sertoli cells. Adult C57BL/6 mice were divided into one control group (0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), and four FLC-treated groups (3,15,75,375 mg/kg). The animals (ten mice per group) received gavage for 28 days. After treatment, histological analysis, sperm parameters, the microstructure of autophagy and the expression of autophagy-associated proteins in testis were evaluated. Furthermore, to explore the autophagy mechanism, TM4 Sertoli cells were treated with FLC (0,40,80,160 μM) in vitro for 24 h. Cell activity and cytoskeletal changes were measured by MTT assay and F-actin immunofluorescence staining. The formation of autophagosome, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), expression of autophagy marker proteins (LC3, Beclin-1 and P62) and AKT-related pathway proteins (AKT, mTOR) were observed. The ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and AKT agonist (SC79) were used to treat TM4 cells to observe the changes of AKT-mTOR pathway and autophagy. In vivo, it showed that FLC exposure caused testicular injuries, abnormality in epididymal sperm. Moreover, FLC increased the formation of autophagosomes, the accumulation of LC3II/LC3I, Beclin-1 and P62 protein, which is related to the degradation of autophagy. In vitro, FLC triggered TM4 cell autophagy by increasing the formation of autophagosomes and upregulating of LC3II/LC3I, Beclin-1 and P62 levels. In addition, FLC induced ROS production and inhibited the activities of AKT and mTOR kinases. The Inhibition of AKT/mTOR signaling pathways and the activation of autophagy induced by FLC could be efficiently reversed by pretreatment of NAC. Additionally, decreased autophagy and increased cell viability were observed in TM4 cells treated with SC79 and FLC, compared with FLC alone, indicating that FLC-induced autophagy may be pro-death. Taken together, our study provided the evidence that FLC promoted autophagy in TM4 Sertoli cells and that this process may involve ROS-mediated AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.",PMC8073911

Although the mechanisms underlying these long-term effects remain poorly understood, an increasing body of evidence points towards the potential role of epigenetic processes. In the present study, we exposed hatchlings of an isogenic lineage of the self-fertilizing fish mangrove rivulus for 28 days to 4 and 120 ng/L of 17-α-ethinylestradiol. After a recovery period of 140 days, reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on the liver in order to assess the hepatic genome-wide methylation landscape. Across all treatment comparisons, a total of 146 differentially methylated fragments (DMFs) were reported, mostly for the group exposed to 4 ng/L, suggesting a non-monotonic effect of EE2 exposure. Gene ontology analysis revealed networks involved in lipid metabolism, cellular processes, connective tissue function, molecular transport and inflammation. The highest effect was reported for nipped-B-like protein B (NIPBL) promoter region after exposure to 4 ng/L EE2 (+ 21.9%), suggesting that NIPBL could be an important regulator for long-term effects of EE2. Our results also suggest a significant role of DNA methylation in intergenic regions and potentially in transposable elements. These results support the ability of early exposure to endocrine disruptors of inducing epigenetic alterations during adulthood, providing plausible mechanistic explanations for long-term phenotypic alteration. Additionally, this work demonstrates the usefulness of isogenic lineages of the self-fertilizing mangrove rivulus to better understand the biological significance of long-term alterations of DNA methylation by diminishing the confounding factor of genetic variability.",PMC9067464

It has been suggested that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals might increase the risk of H by altering urethral development. However, whether H risk is increased in places heavily exposed to agricultural pesticides, such as vineyards, remains debated and difficult to ascertain. The objective of the work is to test the possible association of H with residential proximity to vineyards. Residential address at birth of 8,766 H cases born 1980-2011 was taken from 17 specialized surgery centers. The geographical distribution of vineyards was obtained from the European Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) and the distance of address to the nearest vineyard was computed. A first estimate of the variation of H relative risk with distance to vineyards was obtained using as controls 13,105 cryptorchidism (C) cases operated during the same period in the same centers. A separate estimate was obtained from a case-control study using ""virtual controls"" (VC) defined as points of the map sampled to match the demographic distribution of births within the recruitment territories of the study centers. Non-exposed patients were defined as those with a residence between 5,000 and 10,000 m from the closest vineyard. The residential distance to vineyard was smaller for H than for C cases (p<10-4). We found 42/8766 H cases (0.48%) and 50/13,105 C cases (0.38%) born to mothers living within 20 m of a vineyard. The odds ratios for H were 2.48 (CI: 1.0 to 5.1) and 2.4 (CI: 1.3 to 4.4), vs C or vs VC, respectively, when pregnant mothers lived 10-20 m from a vineyard. In conclusion, our study supports that children born to mothers living close to a vineyard have a two-fold increased risk of H.

All of the rivers studied are important freshwater ecosystems located in the Mediterranean region of Central Chile, each with a unique fish biodiversity. Sequentially, we developed a strategy based on laboratory assays, semicontrolled-field experiments (e.g., caging) and wild fish population assessments to explore the issue of reproductive impacts on both introduced and native fish in Chile. The integration of watershed, field, and laboratory studies was effective at understanding the endocrine responses in Chilean freshwater systems. The studies demonstrated that regardless of the type of treatment, pulp mill effluents can contain compounds capable of impacting endocrine systems. Urban wastewater treatment plant effluents (WWTP) were also investigated using the same integrated strategy. Although not directly compared, PPME and WWTP effluent seem to cause similar estrogenic effects in fish after waterborne exposure, with differing intensities. This body of work underscores the urgent need for further studies on the basic biology of Chilean native fish species, and an improved understanding on reproductive development and variability across Chilean ecosystems. The lack of knowledge of the ontogeny of Chilean fish, especially maturation and sexual development, with an emphasis on associated habitats and landscapes, are impediment factors for their conservation and protection against the threat of EDCs. The assessment of effects on native species in the receiving environment is critical for supporting and designing protective regulations and remediation strategies, and for conserving the unique Chilean fish biodiversity.",PMC8027499

Because of evidence for transgenerational effects of EDCs on the neuroendocrine control of reproductive physiology, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal PCB exposure leads to unique hypothalamic gene-expression profiles in three generations. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated on gestational days 16 and 18 with the PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221), vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil), or estradiol benzoate (EB, 50 μg/kg), the latter a positive control for estrogenic effects of A1221. Maternal- and paternal-lineage F2 and F3 generations were bred using untreated partners. The anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and arcuate nucleus (ARC), involved in the hypothalamic control of reproduction, were dissected from F1 to F3 females and males, RNA extracted, and gene expression measured in a qPCR array. We detected unique gene-expression profiles in each generation, which were sex- and lineage-specific. In the AVPV, treatment significantly changed 10, 25, and 11 transcripts in F1, F2, and F3 generations, whereas 10, 1, and 12 transcripts were changed in these generations in the ARC. In the F1 AVPV and ARC, most affected transcripts were decreased by A1221. In the F2 AVPV, most effects of A1221 were observed in females of the maternal lineage, whereas only Pomc expression changed in the F2 ARC (by EB). The F3 AVPV and ARC were mainly affected by EB. It is notable that results in one generation do not predict results in another, and that lineage was a major determinant in results. Thus, transient prenatal exposure of F1 rats to A1221 or EB can alter hypothalamic gene expression across three generations in a sex- and lineage-dependent manner, leading to the conclusion that the legacy of PCBs continues for generations.",PMC8444700

Recent studies suggest endocrine disrupting effects of glyphosate. Specifically, in our work in rodents, low-dose early-life exposure to Roundup® (glyphosate-based herbicide) lengthened anogenital distance (AGD) in male and female offspring. AGD is a marker of the prenatal hormone milieu in rodents and humans. The relationship between glyphosate exposure and AGD has not been studied in humans. We conducted a pilot study in 94 mother-infant pairs (45 female and 49 male) from The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES). For each infant, two AGD measurements were collected after birth; the anopenile (AGD-AP) and anoscrotal (AGD-AS) distances for males, and anoclitoral (AGD-AC) and anofourchette distances (AGD-AF) for females. We measured levels of glyphosate and its degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in 2nd trimester maternal urine samples using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We assessed the relationship between exposure and AGD using sex-stratified multivariable linear regression models. Glyphosate and AMPA were detected in 95% and 93% of the samples (median 0.22 ng/mL and 0.14 ng/mL, respectively). Their concentrations were moderately correlated (r = 0.55, p = 5.7 × 10-9). In female infants, high maternal urinary glyphosate (above the median) was associated with longer AGD-AC (β = 1.48, 95%CI (-0.01, 3.0), p = 0.05), but this was not significant after covariate adjustment. Increased AMPA was associated with longer AGD-AF (β = 1.96, 95%CI (0.44, 3.5), p = 0.01) after adjusting for infant size and age at AGD exam. No associations were detected in male offspring.

We evaluate sex steroid hormone production in the pubertal period and after maturation in male Wistar rats exposed to low doses of o,p'-DDT, either during prenatal and postnatal development or postnatal development alone. Prenatally and postnatally exposed rats exhibit lower testosterone production and increased estradiol and estriol serum levels after maturation, associated with the delayed growth of gonads. Postnatally exposed rats demonstrate accelerated growth of gonads and higher testosterone production in the pubertal period. In contrast to the previous group, they do not present raised estradiol production. All of the exposed animals exhibit a reduced conversion of progesterone to 17OH-progesterone after sexual maturation, which indicates putative attenuation of sex steroid production. Thus, the study reveals age-dependent outcomes of low-dose exposure to DDT. Prenatal onset of exposure results in the later onset of androgen production and the enhanced conversion of androgens to estrogens after puberty, while postnatal exposure induces the earlier onset of androgen secretion.",PMC8003643

The aim of this study is to identify phytopharmaceutical active substances (PAS) that are an ED or are toxic on endocrine glands (TEG), and to propose an ED/TEG effect indicator. Five international official databases were analyzed to identify the occurrence of health outcomes for 458 PAS. Health outcomes targeting seven endocrine systems were selected. For each substance, the level of evidence of the collected information and the number of outcomes were used to affect a level of concern about ED/TEG effects. Among the substances studied, 10% had a global ED/TEG effect classified as 'high concern', 55% as 'medium concern', 9% as 'low concern', and 26% as 'unknown'. Ten of the high ED/TEG concern substances and 170 medium or low concern substances were licensed in 2018 in France. The outcomes were mainly on the reproductive organs, thyroid, and adrenal glands. Eight of the 41 biocontrol products studied were classified: 5 were 'high' or 'medium concern' and 3 had 'unknown effect'. Although the proposed ED/TEG indicator is not an official classification, it can be used as an epidemiological tool for classifying the occupational and environmental risks of substances in retrospective population studies and be useful for occupational health physicians.",PMC8036992

To investigate associations of repeated measures of urinary bisphenols and phthalates in early and midpregnancy with serum pregnenolone, progesterone, allopregnanolone, and pregnanolone concentrations in midpregnancy and PPD symptoms at 4 months postpartum. Prospective cohort study of 139 pregnant women recruited between 2016 and 2018. Bisphenols and phthalates were measured in early and midpregnancy urine samples. Serum sex steroid hormone concentrations were measured in midpregnancy. PPD was assessed at 4 months postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Multiple informant models were fit using generalized estimating equations. Serum levels of allopregnanolone, progesterone, pregnanolone, and pregnenolone were examined as log-transformed continuous variables. PPD symptoms were examined as continuous EPDS scores and dichotomously with scores ≥10 defined as PPD. Di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP) and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) metabolites were associated with reduced progesterone concentrations. Log-unit increases in ∑DnOP and ∑DiNP predicted 8.1% (95% CI -15.2%, -0.4%) and 7.7% (95% CI -13.3%, -1.7%) lower progesterone, respectively. ∑DnOP was associated with increased odds of PPD (odds ratio 1.48; 95% CI 1.04, 2.11).

As concerns have been raised about its toxicological and public health effect, the use of alternatives to bisphenol A are now increasing. Bisphenol S is one of the analogues being used as a replacement for bisphenol A despite the fact that little is known about the effects of bisphenol S on living organisms. In this study, we investigated the potential endocrine and genotoxic effects of bisphenol A and bisphenol S in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). The fish were exposed to the compounds for either 2 weeks or 8 weeks via sustained-release cholesterol implants containing doses of 2 mg/kg fish or 20 mg/kg fish of the substances. The effects on the thyroid hormone levels and the estrogenic disrupting marker vitellogenin were evaluated, along with the genotoxic markers micronucleated cells and erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities. An increase in plasma vitellogenin was observed in fish exposed to the high dose of bisphenol A for 2 weeks. At this experimental time the level of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in plasma was elevated after bisphenol S exposure at the high concentration, and paralleled by an increase of micronucleated cells. Moreover, bisphenol A induced an increase of micronuclei frequency in fish erythrocytes after the exposure at the lowest dose tested.

We quantified concentrations of 52 endocrine-disrupting chemicals in maternal serum collected during pregnancy at median 15-week gestation. Birth weight, crown-to-heel length, and head circumference were measured at birth; ponderal index and small for gestational age were calculated from these. We used repeated holdout Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression to examine mixtures in 313 mothers. Using WQS regression, all mixtures (each chemical class separately and all three together) were inversely associated with birth weight. A one-unit increase in WQS index (a one-decile increase in chemical concentrations) for all three classes combined was associated with 55 g (β = -55 g, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -89, -22 g) lower birth weight. Associations were weaker but still inverse using Bayesian kernel machine regression. Under both methods, PFAS were the most important contributors to the association with birth weight.

The results achieved for SQAS, which can be regarded as potential micropollutants, were compared with those obtained for two well-known micropollutants diclofenac and 17α-ethinylestradiol subjected to the same testing procedures. This work demonstrated that acetylation of the hydroxyl group of the carbohydrate head of SQAS decreased the toxicity of this class of biosurfactants towards Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, it contributed to the decrease of their endocrine disrupting potency. None of the SQAS studied showed clear agonist activity for female or male hormones. SQAS1 and SQAS2 revealed weak antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic potency. All of these properties were weaker, not only to the potency of the appropriate positive control in the antagonists bioassays, but also compared to the potency of other tested compounds, i.e. DCF and EE2.

Pregnancy is believed to have long-term protective effects against breast cancer development; however, it is unknown if EDCs can alter this effect. We examined the long-term effects of propylparaben, a common preservative used in personal care products and foods, with estrogenic properties, on the parous mouse mammary gland. Pregnant BALB/c mice were treated with 0, 20, 100, or 10 000 µg/kg/day propylparaben throughout pregnancy and lactation. Unexposed nulliparous females were also evaluated. Five weeks post-involution, mammary glands were collected and assessed for changes in histomorphology, hormone receptor expression, immune cell number, and gene expression. For several parameters of mammary gland morphology, propylparaben reduced the effects of parity. Propylparaben also increased proliferation, but not stem cell number, and induced modest alterations to expression of ERα-mediated genes. Finally, propylparaben altered the effect of parity on the number of several immune cell types in the mammary gland. These results suggest that propylparaben, at levels relevant to human exposure, can interfere with the effects of parity on the mouse mammary gland and induce long-term alterations to mammary gland structure.

To assess the association between in utero exposure to BPA and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD-) symptoms and symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in 2 and 5-year old Danish children. In the prospective Odense Child Cohort, BPA was measured in urine samples collected in gestational week 28 and adjusted for osmolality. ADHD and ASD symptoms were assessed with the use of the ADHD scale and ASD scale, respectively, derived from the Child Behaviour Checklist preschool version (CBCL/1½-5) at ages 2 and 5 years. Negative binomial and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between maternal BPA exposure (continuous ln-transformed or divided into tertiles) and the relative differences in ADHD and ASD problem scores and the odds (OR) of an ADHD and autism score above the 75th percentile adjusting for maternal educational level, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity and child age at evaluation in 658 mother-child pairs at 2 years of age for ASD-score, and 427 mother-child pairs at 5 years of age for ADHD and ASD-score. BPA was detected in 85.3% of maternal urine samples even though the exposure level was low (median 1.2 ng/mL). No associations between maternal BPA exposure and ASD at age 2 years or ADHD at age 5 years were found. Trends of elevated Odds Ratios (ORs) were seen among 5 year old children within the 3rd tertile of BPA exposure with an ASD-score above the 75th percentile (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 0.97,3.32), being stronger for girls (OR = 3.17, 95% CI 1.85,9.28). A dose-response relationship was observed between BPA exposure and ASD-score at 5 years of age (p-trend 0.06) in both boys and girls, but only significant in girls (p-trend 0.03).

Phthalate metabolites were quantified in maternal urines pooled from across pregnancy. The task included familiarization trials (infant shown 2 identical faces) and test trials (infant shown the now familiar face paired with a novel one). Half of the infants saw one set of faces as familiar (set 1) and half saw the other set as familiar (set 2). During familiarization trials, average run duration (time looking at stimuli before looking away, measure of processing speed), and time to familiarization (time to reach 20 s looking at the stimuli, measure of attention) were assessed. During test trials, novelty preference (proportion of time looking at the novel face, measure of recognition memory) was assessed.

Mothers were mostly white and college educated, and urine phthalate concentrations were similar to those in reproductive age women in the U.S. All phthalate exposure biomarkers, except MEP, were associated with increases in average run duration. However, depending on the phthalate, associations were only in males or infants who saw the set 2 stimuli as familiar. Unexpectedly, ΣAA was associated with a shorter time to reach familiarization. Phthalate biomarkers also were associated with modest decrements in novelty preference, but these associations were nonsignificant.

Lizards treated with OP and OP + NP had a higher concentration of T3 in the liver and 5'ORD (type II) activity, whereas T4 concentrations were lower than that observed in the control group. Moreover, histological examination showed that the volume of the thyroid follicles became smaller in treated lizards suggesting that that thyroid follicular epithelial cells were not functionally active following treatment.

Thyroid hormones (TH) are crucial regulators of metabolism, growth, and differentiation. The perinatal stage is most reliant on TH, thus vulnerable to TH disrupting chemicals. Dysregulation of TH signaling during perinatal development can weaken T cell function in maturity, raising the question of whether TH disrupting chemicals can perturb thymocyte development. Using Xenopus laevis tadpoles as model, we determined TH disrupting effects and thymocyte alterations following exposure to a mixture of common waterborne TH disrupting chemicals at concentrations similar to those found in contaminated water. This mixture included naphthalene, ethylene glycol, ethoxylated nonylphenol, and octylphenol, which have documented TH disrupting activity. Besides hypertrophy-like pathology in the thyroid gland and delayed metamorphosis, exposure to the mixture antagonized TH receptor-induced transcription of the Krüppel-like factor 9 transcription factor and significantly raised thyroid-stimulating hormone gene expression in the brain, two genes that modulate thymocyte differentiation. Importantly, exposure to this mixture reduced the number of Xenopus immature cortical thymocyte-specific-antigen (CTX+) and mature CD8+ thymocytes, whereas co-exposure with exogenous TH (T3) abolished the effect. When each chemical of the mixture was individually tested, only ethylene glycol induced significant antagonist effects on brain, thymic gene expression, and CD8+ thymocytes. These results suggest that EDCs in mixture are more potent than each chemical alone to perturb thymocyte development through TH-dependent pathway, and provide a starting point to research TH influence on thymocyte development.",PMC8162639

Weaning male Sprague-Dawley rats (22 days old) were either exposed to water containing 0.1% ethanol for control or different concentrations of BPS (0.5, 5, and 50 μg/L) in drinking water for 48 weeks in the chronic exposure study. After completion of the experimental period, animals were dissected and different parameters (hormone concentrations, histology of testis and epididymis, oxidative stress and level of antioxidant enzymes in the testis, daily sperm production (DSP), and sperm parameters) were determined. Results of the present study showed a significant alteration in the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and relative reproductive organ weights. Oxidative stress in the testis was significantly elevated while sperm motility, daily sperm production, and the number of sperm in epididymis were reduced. Plasma testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were reduced and estradiol levels were high in the 50 μg/L-exposed group. Histological observations involved a significant reduction in the epithelial height of the testis along with disrupted spermatogenesis, an empty lumen of the seminiferous tubules, and the caput region of the epididymis.

Here, we reveal that estrogen receptor 1, activated by estrogen, binds to the 5' region of the anti-Mullerian hormone (Amh) gene and upregulates its transcription before follicle formation in cultured mouse fetal ovaries. Ectopic expression of AMH protein was observed in pregranulosa cells of these explants. Furthermore, the addition of AMH to the culture medium inhibited normal follicle formation. Conversely, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) produced in the fetal liver reportedly blocks estrogen action, although its role in follicle formation is unclear.

We investigated associations between measures of in utero phthalate exposure and ADHD symptoms, such as inattention and impulsivity, in childhood (age 6-11 years, n = 221) and in adolescence (age 9-18 years, n = 200), as well as cross-sectional relationships between phthalate exposure and ADHD symptoms in adolescence (n = 491) among participants in the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort. Women provided urine samples up to three times during pregnancy and adolescents provided a urine sample at 9-18 years of age for phthalate metabolite measurement. We administered the Conners' Continuous Performance Test (CPT) when children were age 6-11 years and again at 9-18 years of age. We used multivariable linear regression to examine associations between the geometric mean of phthalate metabolite levels across pregnancy and CPT scores in childhood or adolescence separately, adjusting for age, years schooling (at 9-18 only), maternal education, and specific gravity. Although average in utero phthalate concentrations were not associated with CPT scores in childhood, interquartile range (IQR) increases of in utero MBzP, MCPP, and MBP were associated with 4.2%, 4.7%, and 4.5% (p < 0.05) higher Omissions scores in adolescence, respectively, indicating higher inattention. In utero MiBP levels were also associated with higher Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) and Variability scores (5.4% and 5.5% per IQR, p < 0.05) in adolescence. In addition, urinary DEHP metabolite levels during adolescence were cross-sectionally associated with poorer scores on several CPT indices indicating greater inattention. These findings suggest that in utero phthalate exposure may have adverse effects on attention, but these effects may not appear until adolescence, a period of extensive neurodevelopment. Future research investigating the long-term effects of in utero phthalate exposure on attention and ADHD in adolescence, as well as identification of potential mechanisms involved, is needed.",PMC8119354

Several studies showed an association between p,p'DDT exposure and reprotoxic effects. We showed that p,p'DDT was a positive allosteric modulator of human follitropin receptor (FSHR). In contrast, we demonstrated that p,p'DDT decreased the cyclic AMP (cAMP) production induced by human choriogonadotropin (hCG). This study evaluated further the effects of p,p'DDT on Gs-, β-arrestin 2- and steroidogenesis pathways induced by hCG or luteinizing hormone (LH). We used Chinese hamster ovary cells line stably expressing hCG/LHR. The effects of 10-100 µM p,p'DDT on cAMP production and on β-arrestin 2 recruitment were measured using bioluminescence and time-resolved resonance energy transfer technology. The impact of 100 µM of p,p'DDT on steroid secretion was analysed in murine Leydig tumor cell line (mLTC-1). In cAMP assays, 100 µM p,p'DDT increased the EC50 by more than 300% and reduced the maximum response of the hCG/LHR to hCG and hLH by 30%. This inhibitory effect was also found in human granulosa cells line and in mLTC-1 cells. Likewise, 100 µM p,p'DDT decreased the hCG- and hLH-promoted β-arrestin 2 recruitment down to 14.2 and 26.6%, respectively. Moreover, 100 µM p,p'DDT decreased by 30 and 47% the progesterone secretion induced by hCG or hLH, respectively, without affecting testosterone secretion. This negative effect of p,p'DDT was independent of cytotoxicity. p,p'DDT acted as a negative allosteric modulator of the hCG/LHR signalling. This emphasizes the importance of analyzing all receptor-downstream pathways to fully understand the deleterious effects of EDC on human health.",3465272

Furthermore, potential sources of EDC exposition regarding patients' lifestyle and socioeconomic factors were investigated. Human FF was collected from a total of 210 women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection-treatment cycles because of male subfertility. The presence of EDCs was analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Thirteen of the 14 investigated EDCs were present in every FF sample; compounds with the highest concentrations in FF were nonylphenol and Mirex. Nearly all kinds of EDCs led to significantly reduced maturation and fertilization rate. No significant influence of EDC concentration on the clinical pregnancy rate was observed for neither of the analyzed EDCs. Patients who obtained their clothes and textiles at fashion discounters displayed a higher amount of EDCs in their FF.

EDC exposure, especially during critical periods of development like the prenatal window, may interfere with the body's endocrine system, which can affect growth and developmental outcomes such as puberty. Most studies have examined one EDC at a time in relation to disease; however, humans are exposed to many EDCs. By studying mixtures, the human experience can be more closely replicated. We investigated the association of prenatal exposure to persistent EDCs (poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)) as mixtures with early menarche among female offspring in a nested case-control study within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) recruited in the United Kingdom in 1991-1992. Concentrations of 52 EDCs were quantified in maternal serum samples collected during pregnancy. Daughter's age at menarche was ascertained through mailed questionnaires sent annually. We used repeated holdout weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to examine the association between prenatal exposure to multiple EDCs and early menarche (<11.5 (n = 218) vs. ≥11.5 years (n = 230)) for each chemical class separately (PFAS, PCBs, and OCPs) and for all three classes combined. Models adjusted for maternal age at menarche, maternal education, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, maternal age, prenatal smoking, and gestational week at sample collection. Mixture models showed null associations between prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures and early menarche. Using WQS regression, the odds ratio for early menarche for a one-decile increase in chemical concentrations for all three classes combined was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.05); using BKMR, the odds ratio when all exposures were at the 60th percentile compared to the median was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.05).

The FSTRA was designed to detect endocrine disrupting effects of chemicals interacting with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) such as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptor (Esr) and/or the androgen receptor (AR) and steroidogenesis inhibitors. We conducted the FSTRA with Japanese medaka, in accordance with OECD test guideline number 229 (TG229), for 16 chemicals including four Esr agonists, two Esr antagonists, three AR agonists, two AR antagonists, two steroidogenesis inhibitors, two progesterone receptor agonists, and a negative substance, and evaluated the usability and the validity of the FSTRA (TG229) protocol.

Estrone (E1), a natural steroid, is found in aquatic environments sometimes at high concentrations relative to the estrogenic steroids 17β-estradiol (E2) and 17α-ethynylestradiol. However, E1 has been less thoroughly studied than E2 or 17α-ethynylestradiol due in part to a relatively lower potency in metabolically limited estrogen receptor (ER) binding/activation assays. Recent evidence suggests that in vivo biotransformation of E1 to E2 may occur in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) residing in environments with high concentrations of E1, such as near wastewater treatment plants. The enzymes likely responsible for this biotransformation, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17βHSDs), have been well characterized in mammals but to a lesser extent in fish species. In the present study, a novel systematic analysis of amino acid sequence data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database demonstrated that multiple 17βHSD isoforms are conserved across different fish species. Experimentally, we showed that metabolically active hepatic cytosolic preparations from 2 commercially important salmonid species, rainbow trout and lake trout, biotransformed E1 to E2 to a degree sufficient to alter results of competitive ER binding assays.

Lower limits of quantification when using 0.25 L of water ranged from 0.05 to 1.0 ng/L. The validated method was applied to two different experiments with small fish species exposed to an EDC known to affect steroid synthesis, fadrozole. Concentrations of the 13 steroids were measured in plasma or holding water from the studies. This work demonstrates the potential application of the developed method to measure endogenous steroids for identification of EDCs in aquatic toxicology studies.",PMC8543844

Although the mechanism of toxicity of many EDCs have been studied in detail, little work has focused on understanding the mechanisms through which pregnant dams and fetuses protect themselves from EDCs, or if those protective mechanisms are sexually dimorphic in fetuses. In this study, we examined proteomic alterations in the livers of mouse dams and their male and female fetuses induced by vinclozolin, a model antiandrogenic EDC. Dam livers upregulated nine phase I and phase II detoxification pathways and pathway analysis revealed that more pathways are significantly enriched in dam livers than in fetal livers. Phase I and II detoxification proteins are also involved in steroid and steroid hormone biosynthesis and vinclozolin likely alters steroid levels in both the dam and the fetus. The response of the fetal liver proteome to vinclozolin exposure is sexually dimorphic. Female fetal livers upregulated proteins in xenobiotic metabolism pathways, whereas male fetal livers upregulated proteins in oxidative phosphorylation pathways. These results suggest that female fetuses increase protective mechanisms, whereas male fetuses increase ATP production and several disease pathways that are indicative of oxidative damage. Females fetuses upregulate proteins and protective pathways that were similar to the dams whereas males did not. If this sexually dimorphic pattern is typical, then males might generally be more sensitive to EDCs.",PMC9152768

This cross-sectional study was performed from September 2014 to November 2014 and included 307 Korean reproductive-aged women. Anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests with urine and blood sampling and pelvic ultrasound examinations were performed. Urinary bisphenol A (BLA) level was significantly higher in the DOR group with anti-Müllerian hormone lower than 25 percentile (1.89 ± 2.17 ug/g and 1.58 ± 1.08 ug/g, P < 0.05). Urinary mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate and mono-N-butyl phthalate, and substrates of phthalate were evaluated and no significant difference was observed between the DOR group and non-DOR group. Logistic regression analysis suggested an increase in infertility in high BPA exposure group and the odds ratio (OR, 4.248) was statistically significant after adjustment for age, birth control pills, and the age of menarche, parity, and waist circumference. High phthalate exposure was associated with endometrial polyp after adjustment (OR, 2.742). BPA exposure might be associated with DOR and infertility. Meanwhile, endometrial polyp is increased in women with high phthalate exposure.

The high food-to-microorganism (F/M) ratios and low solid retention times (SRTs) and hydraulic retention times (HRTs) applied in HRAS systems result in the maximization of organic matter diversion to the sludge which can produce large amounts of biogas during anaerobic digestion, thus moving toward energy-neutral (or positive) treatment processes. However, in addition to the energy optimization, the removal of emerging contaminants (ECs) is the new challenge in wastewater treatment. In the context of this study, the removal efficiencies and the fates of selected ECs (three endocrine disruptors (endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs))-nonylphenol, bisphenol A and triclosan, and four pharmaceuticals (PhACs)-ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac and ketoprofen) in HRAS systems have been studied. According to the results, EDCs occurred in raw wastewater and secondary sludge at higher concentrations compared to PhACs. In HRAS operating schemes, all compounds were poorly (<40%) to moderately (<60%) removed. Regarding removal mechanisms, biotransformation was found to be the dominant process for PhACs, while for EDCs sorption onto sludge is the most significant removal mechanism affecting their fates and their presence in excess sludge.",PMC7825564

As BPA is classified among xenoestrogens, we compared its action and effects with those of 17β-estradiol (E2). Chemotaxis of neutrophils was examined using the Boyden chamber. Their phagocytosis and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase activity were assessed via Park's method with latex beads and Park's test with nitroblue tetrazolium. To assess the total concentration of nitric oxide (NO), the Griess reaction was utilized. Flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was analyzed using a microscope (IN Cell Analyzer 2200 system). Expression of the investigated proteins was determined using Western blot. The analysis of results obtained for both sexes demonstrated that after exposure to BPA, the chemotactic capacity of neutrophils was reduced. In the presence of BPA, the phagocytic activity was found to be elevated in the cells obtained from women and reduced in the cells from men. Following exposure to BPA, the percentage of neutrophils with CD14 and CD284 (TLR4) expression, as well as the percentage of cells forming NETs, was increased in the cells from both sexes. The stimulatory role of BPA and E2 in the activation of NADPH oxidase was observed only in female cells. On the other hand, no influence of E2 on the expression of CD14 and CD284, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and the amount of NET-positive neutrophils was found for both sexes. The study further showed that BPA intensified NO production and iNOS expression in the cells of both sexes. In addition, intensified expression of all tested PI3K-Akt pathway proteins was observed in male neutrophils. The study demonstrated the influence of BPA on neutrophil functions associated with locomotion and pathogen elimination, which in turn may disturb the immune response of these cells in both women and men.

Our recent findings suggest that these disease states possibly arise as a result of disruption of testicular stem cells biology by perinatal insults including exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals. Testicular stem cells include relatively quiescent, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs), and actively dividing spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Both VSELs and SSCs express estrogen receptors and are directly vulnerable to endocrine disruption. Exposing mice pups to estradiol (20 μg/pup/day on days 5-7) or diethylstilbestrol (2 μg/pup/day on days 1-5) affected spermatogenesis during adult life with reduced numbers of tubules in stage VIII, tetraploid cells and sperm. These mice were infertile and majority of diethylstilbestrol treated mice revealed testicular cancer-like changes. An increase in VSEL numbers, observed by both flow cytometry and qRT-PCR, was associated with marked reduction of c-KIT positive spermatogonial cells. VSELs undergo epigenetic changes due to endocrine disruption that results in blocked differentiation (impaired spermatogenesis) leading to reduced sperm count and infertility, and their excessive self-renewal initiates cancer-like changes in adult life. Thus, testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) has a stem cell rather than a genetic basis.",7333523

In this study, a yeast multi endocrine-effect screen (YMEES) for the detection of endocrine effects is combined with HPTLC. Simultaneous detection of estrogenic, androgenic, and gestagenic effects on the HPTLC plate is achieved by mixing different genetically modified Arxula adeninivorans yeast strains, which contain either the human estrogen, androgen, or progesterone receptor. Depending on the yeast strain, different fluorescent proteins are formed when an appropriate substance binds to the specific hormone receptor. This allows to measure hormonal effects at different wavelengths. Two yeast cell application approaches, immersion and spraying, are compared. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the method are shown by dose-response investigations for reference compounds. The spraying approach indicated similar sensitivities and higher precisions for the tested hormones compared to immersion. The EC10s for estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and progesterone (P4) were 95, 1.4, 10, 7.4, and 15 pg/spot, respectively. Recovery rates of E1, E2, EE2, DHT, and P4 between 88 and 120% show the usability of the general method in combination with sample enrichment by solid phase extraction (SPE). The simultaneous detection of estrogenic, androgenic, and gestagenic effects in wastewater and surface water samples demonstrates the successful application of the YMEES in such matrices. This promising method allows us to identify more than one endocrine effect on the same HPTLC plate, which saves time and material. The method could be used for comparison, evaluation, and monitoring of different river sites and wastewater treatment steps and should be tested in further studies.",6965340

There is however a paucity of literature examining this association, and no study has accounted for the complex nature of EDCs exposure as a time-varying mixture of chemicals. We examined the association between trimester-specific EDCs mixture and GWG in pregnant women attending a fertility clinic, to identify windows of susceptibility to such exposures, and assess the individual contribution of each chemical over pregnancy. We included 243 pregnant women from the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study, who provided up to 3 urine samples (one per trimester), and with available data on GWG. Urinary concentrations of 7 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, and 2 parabens, corrected for specific gravity, were included in the analysis. The association between trimester-specific EDCs mixture and GWG was evaluated using multiple regression models - categorizing exposures into concentration quartiles- and with Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), while adjusting for potential confounders. Hierarchical BKMR (hBKMR) was used to account for the time-varying nature of chemical concentrations over pregnancy, identifying the most important trimester and most important EDC within each trimester. During 1st trimester, higher GWG was observed at higher sum of metabolites of di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (ΣDEHP) from both multiple regression (e.g. comparing the 4th quartile with the 1st: β = 2.36 kg, 95% CI: 0.47, 5.19) and BKMR. During 2nd and 3rd trimesters, positive associations with mono-n-butyl phthalate and propylparaben, and negative with ΣDEHP and methylparaben were observed. When evaluating exposures as a time-varying mixture with hBKMR, 1st trimester was the most important exposure window when evaluating prenatal urinary EDCs in relation to GWG. Within the 1st trimester, urinary ΣDEHP, mono-isobutyl phthalate and propylparaben had the highest contribution in the positive association between the mixture and GWG. We observed positive associations between urinary EDCs during pregnancy, especially DEHP metabolites, and GWG. Our results suggest the 1st trimester of pregnancy as the time window of highest susceptibility to the effects of EDCs on GWG, with potential indication for the design of public health interventions, informing prevention strategies for reducing sources of exposure at specific time points.",PMC7946748

Women are exposed to multiple different phthalates daily, therefore this study investigated the effects of an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture (PHTmix) on ovulation. Ovulation is initiated by the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, which induces prostaglandin (PG) production, progesterone (P4)/progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. We hypothesized that the PHTmix would directly inhibit ovulation by altering the levels of PGs, P4/PGR, and enzymes involved in ECM remodeling. Antral follicles from CD-1 mice were treated with vehicle control alone (dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO), hCG alone (LH analog), and hCG+PHTmix (1-500μg/ml), and samples were collected across the ovulatory period. The PHTmix decreased ovulation rates at all doses tested in a dose-dependent manner when compared to hCG. PG levels were decreased by the PHTmix when compared to hCG, which was potentially mediated by altered levels of PG synthesis (Ptgs2) and transport (Slco2a1) genes. The PHTmix altered P4 and Pgr levels when compared to hCG, leading to decreases in downstream PGR-mediated genes (Edn2, Il6, Adamts1). ECM remodeling was potentially dysregulated by altered levels of ovulatory mediators belonging to the matrix metalloproteases and plasminogen activator families. These data suggest that phthalate exposure inhibits ovulation by altering PG levels, P4/PGR action, and ECM remodeling.",PMC8454202

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro effects of exposure to C6O4, compared with PFOA and PFOS on thyroid cells. FRTL5 rat-thyroid cell lines and normal human thyroid cells (NHT) were incubated with increasing concentrations of C6O4 for 24, 48, 72, and 144 h to assess cell viability by WST-1. Cell viability was confirmed by AnnexinV/PI staining. Long-chain PFAS (PFOA and PFOS) were used at same concentrations as positive controls. The proliferation of cells exposed to C6O4, PFOA, and PFOS was measured by staining with crystal violet and evaluation of optical density after incubation with SDS. Changes in ROS production by FRTL5 and NHT after exposure to C6O4 at short (10, 20, and 30 min) and long-time points (24 h) were evaluated by cytofluorimetry. C6O4 exposure did not modify FRTL5 and NHT cell viability at any concentration and/or time points with no induction of necrosis/apoptosis. At difference, PFOS exposure reduced cell viability of FRTL5 while and NHT, while PFOA only in FRTL5. FRTL5 and NHT cell proliferation was reduced by incubation with by PFOA and PFOS, but not with C6O4. ROS production by NHT and FRTL5 cells was not modified after C6O4 exposure, at any time/concentration tested.

This process plays a critical role in determining the normal development and maturation of the brain throughout life. Exposure to certain physical or chemical factors during the perinatal period can lead to many neuropathological defects that cause high cognitive dysfunction and are accompanied by abnormal hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity. As an endocrine disruptor, gossypol is generally known to exert detrimental effects in animals exposed under experimental conditions. However, it is unclear whether gossypol affects neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus during early developmental stages. Pregnant Institute of Cancer Research mice were treated with gossypol at a daily dose of 0, 20, and 50 mg/kg body weight from embryonic day 6.5 to postnatal day (P) 21. The changes of hippocampal neurogenesis as well as potential mechanisms were investigated by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine labeling, behavioral tests, immunofluorescence, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and western-blot analyses. At P8, maternal gossypol exposure impaired neural stem cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus and decreased the number of newborn cells as a result of reduced proliferation of BLBP+ radial glial cells and Tbr2+ intermediate progenitor cells. At P21, the numbers of NeuN+ neurons and parvalbumin+ γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic interneurons were increased following 50 mg/kg gossypol exposure. In addition, gossypol induced hippocampal neuroinflammation, which may contribute to behavioral abnormalities and cognitive deficits and decrease synaptic plasticity. Our findings suggest that developmental gossypol exposure affects hippocampal neurogenesis by targeting the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal stem/progenitor cells, cognitive functions, and neuroinflammation.

Human exposure concentrations to estrone and BPA can be as low as nanomolar levels. However, very few toxicological studies have focused on the nanomolar-dose effects. Low level of EDCs can potentially cause non-monotonic responses. In addition, exposures at different developmental stages can lead to different health outcomes. To identify the nanomolar-dose effects of estrone and BPA, we used zebrafish modeling to study the phenotypic and transcriptomic responses after extended duration exposure from 0 to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) and short-term exposure at days 4-5 post fertilization. We found that non-monotonic transcriptomic responses occurred after extended duration exposures at 1 nM of estrone or BPA. At this level, estrone also caused hypoactivity locomotive behavior in zebrafish. After both extended duration and short-term exposures, BPA led to more apparent phenotypic responses, i.e. skeletal abnormalities and locomotion changes, and more significant transcriptomic responses than estrone exposure. After short-term exposure, BPA at concentrations equal or above 100 nM affected locomotive behavior and changed the expression of both estrogenic and non-estrogenic genes that are linked to neurological diseases.

We used linear regression to independently examine urinary metal concentrations in relation to each peripubertal reproductive hormones adjusting for child age and BMI. Generalized estimation equations (GEEs) were used to evaluate the association of in utero and peripubertal metal exposures with sexual maturation and progression during follow-up based on Tanner staging and testicular volume.

Children born to women with higher PFOA concentrations had lower infancy and early childhood BMI, earlier BMI nadir, accelerating BMI gains in mid-childhood and adolescence, and higher BMI at age 12 years. Some of these associations were non-monotonic. PFOS and PFHxS were not associated with alterations in BMI trajectories, but were monotonically associated with lower BMI across infancy, childhood, and adolescence. Compared to children in the first PFOS tercile, those in the second (β: -0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.11, 0.51 kg/m2), and third (β: -1.41; 95% CI: -2.65, -0.14 kg/m2) had lower BMI at age 12 years. These results suggest that gestational PFOA exposure may be associated with BMI trajectories related to adult obesity and cardiometabolic disease, while PFOS and PFHxS exposure is associated with lower BMI in the first 12 years of life.",PMC7755727

Graphene-like magnetic sawdust biochar was synthesized using potassium ferrate (K2FeO4) to make activated sawdust biochar and applied for the removal of 17-estradiol (E2). The characterization showed that the surface morphology of five graphene-like magnetic sawdust biochars prepared with different preparation conditions were quite different. The specific surface area and pore structure increased with the increment of K2FeO4 addition. The results have shown that graphene-like magnetic sawdust biochar (1:1/900 °C) had the best removal on E2. The experimental results indicated that pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the Langmuir model could describe the adsorption process well, in which the equilibrium adsorption capacity (qe,1) of 1:1/900 °C were 59.18 mg·g-1 obtained from pseudo-first-order kinetic model and the maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of 1:1/900 °C were 133.45 mg·g-1 obtained from Langmuir model at 298K. At the same time, lower temperatures, the presence of humic acid (HA), and the presence of NaCl could be regulated to change the adsorption reaction in order to remove E2. Adsorption capacity was decreased with the increase of solution pH because pH value not only changed the surface charge of graphene-like magnetic sawdust biochar, but also affected the E2 in the water. The possible adsorption mechanism for E2 adsorption on graphene-like magnetic sawdust biochar was multifaceted, involving chemical adsorption and physical absorption, such as H-bonding, π-π interactions, micropore filling effects, and electrostatic interaction. To sum up, graphene-like magnetic sawdust biochar was found to be a promising absorbent for E2 removal from water.",PMC7696789

However, mechanisms connecting developmental processes to pathologies associated with endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure are poorly understood in naturally exposed populations. We sought to a) characterize divergence in ovarian transcriptomic and follicular profiles between alligators originating from a historically EDC-contaminated site, Lake Apopka, and a reference site; b) test the ability of developmentally precocious estrogen exposure to recapitulate site-associated patterns of divergence; and c) test whether treatment with exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is capable of rescuing phenotypes associated with contaminant exposure and/or embryonic estrogen treatment. Alligators eggs were collected from a contaminated site and a reference site, and a subset of eggs from the reference site were treated with estradiol (E2) during embryonic development prior to gonadal differentiation. After hatching, alligators were raised under controlled laboratory settings for 5 months. Juveniles from both sites were divided and treated with exogenous FSH. Histological analyses and RNA-sequencing were conducted to characterize divergence in ovarian follicle dynamics and transcriptomes between sites, between reference and E2-treated animals, and between FSH-treated and nontreated animals. We observed broad site-of-origin divergence in ovarian transcriptomes and reductions in ovarian follicle density between juvenile alligators from Lake Apopka and the reference site. Treating embryos from the reference site with E2 overwhelmingly recapitulated transcriptional and histological alterations observed in Lake Apopka juveniles. Ovarian phenotypes observed in Lake Apopka alligators or resulting from estrogen treatment were only partially rescued by treatment with exogenous FSH. Recapitulation of ovarian abnormalities by precocious E2 revealed a relatively simple mechanism underlying contaminant-induced pathologies in a historical example of environmental endocrine disruption. Findings reported here support a model where the developmental timing of estrogen signaling has the potential to permanently alter ovarian organization and function. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6627.",PMC7665278

One of the most commonly encountered phthalate replacements is di(isononyl)cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH). Currently, little is known about the prevalence of human exposure, bioactivity, and endocrine disrupting potential of DINCH. We sampled urine from 100 pregnant women during the second trimester of pregnancy living in Charleston, SC between 2011 and 2014 and measured the following DINCH metabolites by LC-MS/MS: cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono(hydroxy-isononyl) ester (OH-MINCH), cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono(oxo-isononyl) ester (oxo-MINCH), and cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-monocarboxy isooctyl ester (cx-MINCH). These metabolites were also tested on human estrogen receptor alpha and progesterone receptor beta transactivation assays in vitro. OH-MINCH was detected in 98% of urine samples. The specific gravity-adjusted median (interquartile range) OH-MINCH concentration was 0.20 (0.25) ng/mL, and concentrations were significantly higher in African American women compared to Caucasian women (p = 0.01). DINCH metabolite concentrations were consistent between years, and they did not exhibit estrogenic or progestogenic activity in vitro. Human exposure to these emerging compounds should continue to be monitored, especially in vulnerable populations, to ensure the replacement of phthalates by DINCH is not a case of regrettable substitution.",PMC7670082

This work describes the use of an amperometric cytosensor (i.e., a whole cell-based amperometric biosensoristic device) for studying mitochondrial interferences of BPA and BPB (5-100 µg/mL) in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae model following long-term (24 h) exposure (acute toxicity). Percentage interference (%ρ) on yeast aerobic mitochondrial catabolism was calculated after comparison of aerobic respiration of exposed and control S. cerevisiae cell suspensions. Results suggested the hypothesis of a dose-dependent co-action of two mechanisms, namely uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress. These mechanisms respectively matched with opposite effects of hyperstimulation and inhibition of cellular respiration. While uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress have been previously described as separate effects from in vitro BPA exposure using other biochemical endpoints and biological systems, effects of BPB on cellular aerobic respiration are here reported for the first time. Results highlighted a similar hyperstimulation effect after exposure to 5 µg/mL BPA and BPB. About a 2-fold higher cellular respiration inhibition potency was observed after exposures to 15, 30, and 100 µg/mL BPB compared to BPA. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) was used as model uncoupling agent.

The analysis of EDCs in wastewater remains a challenge for several reasons, including (a) the multitude of bioactive but partially unknown compounds, (b) the complexity of the wastewater matrix, and (c) the required analytical sensitivity. By coupling biological assays with high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), different samples can be screened simultaneously, highlighting their active components; these may then be identified by chemical analysis. To allow the multiparallel detection of diverse endocrine disruption activities, we have constructed Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based bioreporter strains, responding to compounds with either estrogenic or androgenic activity, by the expression of green (EGFP), red (mRuby), or blue (mTagBFP2) fluorescent proteins. We demonstrate the analytical potential inherent in combining chromatographic compound separation with a direct fluorescent signal detection of EDC activities. The applicability of the system is further demonstrated by separating influent samples of wastewater treatment plants, and simultaneously quantifying estrogenic and androgenic activities of their components. The combination of a chemical separation technique with an optical yeast-based bioassay presents a potentially valuable addition to our arsenal of environmental pollution monitoring tools.",PMC7695312

Live-born infants born in 2007-2008 were selected from the population-based Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities Study. 577 cases with any CHDs were compared to 1731 matched controls. Parental periconceptional occupational exposure to EDCs was assessed by a JEM and by questionnaire-based self-reporting of parents. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore associations between parental occupational exposure to EDCs and the entire spectrum of CHDs and by CHD subtypes in the offspring. Kappa statistics were also performed to determine the consistency among JEM-assessed and self-reported occupational exposure of parents. JEM-assessed paternal exposure to polychlorinated organic substances, phthalates, biphenolic compounds, and solvents were significantly associated with the entire spectrum of CHDs. Ventricular septal defects were significantly associated with paternal self-reported exposure to pesticides, while atrial septal defects were significantly associated to paternal JEM-assessed phthalate exposure. Paternal solvent exposure was significantly associated with atrial septal defects and right ventricle outflow tract obstructions. JEM-assessed and self-reported exposures to pesticides, heavy metals, and solvents exhibited poor agreement for mothers and slight agreement for fathers. Even though parental occupational exposure to EDCs seems to have a minor impact on the occurrence of CHDs, the results of biological and environmental monitoring should be taken into consideration as well.",PMC8032570

There is growing evidence that climate factors may impact metabolic function, including insulin sensitivity. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication, with an estimated global prevalence of up to 14%. While lifestyle and genetic risk factors for GDM are well established, environmental factors may also contribute to GDM risk. Previous reviews have summarized the growing evidence of environmental risk factors for GDM including endocrine disrupting chemicals and ambient air pollution. However, studies of the effects of climate factors on GDM risk have not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to summarize and evaluate the current literature on the associations of climate factors with GDM risk. We conducted systematic searches in PubMed and EMBASE databases for original research articles on associations of climate factors (i.e. ambient temperature, season/seasonality, and humidity) with GDM and/or related glycemic outcomes for all publication dates through September 20th, 2020. Our search identified 16 articles on the associations of ambient temperature and/or season with GDM and maternal glycemic outcomes during pregnancy, which were included in this review. Despite inconsistencies in exposure and outcome assessment, we found consistent evidence of a seasonal effect on GDM risk, with higher prevalence of GDM and higher pregnancy glucose levels in summer months. We found suggestive evidence of an association between higher ambient temperature and elevated glucose levels from GDM screening tests. Climate factors may be associated with GDM risk.

At outermost layer of the antral follicle, theca cells provide structural, steroidogenic, and vascular support. Inter- and extra-thecal GJIC is required for intrafollicular trafficking of signaling molecules. Because GJIC can be altered by hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), we tested if any of five common EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and triphenyltin chloride (TPT)) can interfere with theca cell GJIC. Since most chemicals are reported to repress GJIC, we hypothesized that all chemicals tested, within environmentally relevant human exposure concentrations, will inhibit theca cell GJICs. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used a scrape loading/dye transfer assay. BPS, but no other chemical tested, enhanced GJIC in a dose- and time-dependent manner in ovine primary theca cells. A signal-protein inhibitor approach was used to explore the GJIC-modulatory pathways involved. Phospholipase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors significantly attenuated BPS-induced enhanced GJIC. Human theca cells were used to evaluate translational relevance of these findings. Human primary theca cells had a ∼40% increase in GJIC in response to BPS, which was attenuated with a MAPK inhibitor, suggestive of a conserved mechanism. Upregulation of GJIC could result in hyperplasia of the theca cell layer or prevent ovulation by holding the oocyte in meiotic arrest.

After delivery, lactating rats were divided into four groups (PCB-169, PCB-155, PCB-155 + 169, and control) and administered PCBs intraperitoneally. The femurs of offspring were used to estimate growth rate (µm/day), and histomorphometric analysis on the distal femur included the thickness of the EGP and zones of proliferation and hypertrophy with calcification. Stereometry was used to determine trabecular bone volume density. In the PCB-169 and PCB-155 + 169 groups, PCB-169 affected longitudinal bone growth in the early postnatal period by interfering with chondrocytes in the EGP zone of proliferation and, to a lesser extent, the zone of hypertrophy. Morphometric alterations in EGP structure diminished until puberty. A slow growth rate persisted in the PCB-169 group until PND 42, while in the PCB-155 group, a fast growth rate between PNDs 9 to 22 was significantly reduced between PNDs 22 to 42. Sterometric assessment showed decreased trabecular bone volume in the PCB-155 + 169 group compared with that in the control on PND 9 and increased in the PCB-169 group compared with that in the PCB-155 group on PND 42.

POPs are associated with endocrine-disrupting effects including adverse reproductive outcomes that could affect fecundability, i.e. the capacity to conceive a pregnancy, quantified as time to pregnancy (TTP). Results of epidemiologic studies that examine the impact of various chemical classes of POPs on TTP have not been synthesised. We undertook a systematic review to summarise the strength of evidence for associations of four common groups of POPs with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature in order to inform policy decisions and future research. We performed an electronic search of literature published between 1 January 2007 and 6 August 2019 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE and POPLINE. We included empirical research papers that examined human exposure to organochlorine (OC) pesticides, brominated flame retardants, polychlorinated organic compounds and/or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome. Standardised forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software, and all reviews were completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. The search returned 4573 articles, and 28 papers from 19 different studies met inclusion criteria. Among them, four studies measured TTP prospectively, three had data on participants' prenatal exposure, three examined associations in both male and female partners and one focused exclusively on males. Analyses varied widely in terms of exposure characterisation, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Evidence was strongest for adverse associations of female exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls with TTP, with some additional support for associations of female exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers and PFAS with longer TTP. Our review provided little or no support for associations between female exposure to OC pesticides or male exposure to any of the POP groups and TTP. Evidence suggests that female exposure to at least some POPs may reduce fecundability. Although many of these chemicals are no longer in production, they are still detectable in human biosamples because of their persistence in the environment. Replacement chemicals that are being introduced as older ones are restricted may have similar reproductive consequences. Future studies should examine these newer POPs, assess interactions between POPs and other chemical and non-chemical exposures, investigate how POPs are distributed in and metabolised by the human body and focus on populations that may be disproportionately exposed.",PMC7903116

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are a class of EDCs that have not been rigorously evaluated in terms of prenatal exposure and pubertal growth and development in girls. In a New York City birth cohort of Black and Hispanic girls (n = 196; recruited 1998-2006), we examined associations of prenatal PAH exposure with self-reported age at growth spurt onset, breast development onset and menarche, and clinical measures of adolescent body composition including body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, and body fat measured at ages 11-20 years. We measured prenatal exposure to PAH using personal air monitoring data collected from backpacks worn by mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy (data available for all 196 girls) and biomarkers of benzo[α]pyrene-DNA adducts in umbilical cord blood (data available for 106 girls). We examined associations of prenatal PAH with the timing of pubertal milestones and adolescent body composition (11-20 years) using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for race/ethnicity, household public assistance status at birth, and age at outcome assessment. We also fit models further adjusted for potential mediators, including birthweight and childhood body size (BMI-for-age z-score measured at 6-8 years). Girls in the highest versus lowest tertile of ambient exposure to PAH, based on a summary measure of eight carcinogenic higher-molecular weight non-volatile PAH compounds (Σ8 PAH), had a 0.90 year delay in growth spurt onset (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.25, 1.55; n = 196), a 0.35 year delay in breast development onset (95% CI = -0.26, 0.95; n = 193), and a 0.59 year delay in menarche (95% CI = 0.06, 1.11; n = 191) in models adjusted for race/ethnicity and household public assistance at birth. The statistically significant associations for age at growth spurt onset and menarche were not impacted by adjustment for birthweight or childhood body size. No differences in BMI-for-age z-score, waist-to-hip ratio, or percent body fat were found between girls in the highest versus lowest tertile of ambient Σ8 PAH. Results were similar when we evaluated benzo[α]pyrene-DNA adduct levels.

Our laboratory previously developed a relevant phthalate mixture consisting of six phthalates and found that it disrupted female fertility in mice. However, it is unknown if prenatal exposure to phthalate mixtures can accelerate reproductive aging and if this occurs in multiple generations. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to a mixture of phthalates accelerates biomarkers of reproductive aging in multiple generations of female mice. Pregnant CD-1 mice were orally dosed with vehicle control or a phthalate mixture (20 μg/kg/day-500 mg/kg/day) daily from gestational day 10 to birth. Adult F1 females born to these dams were used to create the F2 and F3 generations by mating them with unexposed males. At 13 months, estrous cyclicity was monitored and ovaries and sera were collected for analysis. In the F1 generation, the mixture decreased testosterone and inhibin B levels, but increased follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels compared to control. In the F2 generation, the phthalate mixture decreased the percent of antral follicles and testosterone hormone levels compared to control. In the F3 generation, prenatal exposure to the phthalate mixture increased ovarian weight, increased the time in metestrus/diestrus, altered follicle numbers, and decreased the levels of luteinizing hormone compared to control. Collectively, these data suggest that prenatal exposure to a phthalate mixture may accelerate several biomarkers of reproductive aging in a multi- and transgenerational manner in female mice.",PMC7736276

Steroid hormones, bisphenols (BPA, BPS, BPF, BPAF) and parabens (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, benzyl-parabens) were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Differences between the groups were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated for the individual parameters relationship. Significantly higher levels of BPA, anti-Müllerain hormone, lutropine, lutropine/folitropine ratio, testosterone, androstenedione, 7beta-OH-epiandrosterone, and cytokines (IL-6, VEGF, PDGF-bb), were found in normal-weight PCOS women compared to controls. Between normal-weight and obese PCOS women, there were no differences in hormonal, but in metabolic parameters. Obese PCOS women had significantly higher insulin resistance, fatty-liver index, triglycerides, cytokines (IL-2, IL-13, IFN-gamma). In healthy, but not in PCOS, women, there was a positive correlation of BPA with testosterone, SHBG with lutropine, and folitropine, while testosterone negatively correlated with SHBG. In obese women with PCOS, insulin resistance negatively correlated with SHBG and estradiol. No differences were observed in the paraben exposure.

A total of 14 multiclass EDCs was detected in the drinking water supply system in Malaysia. Triclosan (an antimicrobial agent) and 4-octylphenol (a plasticizer) were only detected in the tap water (up to 9.74 and 0.44 ng/L, respectively). Meanwhile, chloramphenicol and 4-nonylphenol in the system were below the method detection limits. Bisphenol A was observed to be highest in tap water at 66.40 ng/L (detection: 100%; median concentration: 0.28 ng/L). There was a significant difference in triclosan contamination between the river and tap water (p < 0.001). Overall, the life groups were estimated at no possible risk of EDCs (risk quotient < 1).

Their identification is increasingly difficult due to lack of adequate toxicological tests. This difficulty is particularly problematic for cosmetic ingredients, because in vivo testing is now banned completely in the European Union. The aim was to identify candidate preservatives as endocrine disruptors by in silico methods and to confirm endocrine receptors' activities through nuclear receptors in vitro. We screened preservatives listed in Annex V in the European Union Regulation on cosmetic products to predict their binding to nuclear receptors using the Endocrine Disruptome and VirtualToxLab™ version 5.8 in silico tools. Five candidate preservatives were further evaluated for androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ERα), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and thyroid receptor (TR) agonist and antagonist activities in cell-based luciferase reporter assays in vitro in AR-EcoScreen, hERα-HeLa-9903, MDA-kb2, and GH3.TRE-Luc cell lines. Additionally, assays to test for false positives were used (nonspecific luciferase gene induction and luciferase inhibition). Triclocarban had agonist activity on AR and ERα at 1μM and antagonist activity on GR at 5μM and TR at 1μM. Triclosan showed antagonist effects on AR, ERα, GR at 10μM and TR at 5μM, and bromochlorophene at 1μM (AR and TR) and at 10μM (ERα and GR). AR antagonist activity of chlorophene was observed [inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50) IC50=2.4μM], as for its substantial ERα agonist at >5μM and TR antagonist activity at 10μM. Climbazole showed AR antagonist (IC50=13.6μM), ERα agonist at >10μM, and TR antagonist activity at 10μM. These data support the concerns of regulatory authorities about the endocrine-disrupting potential of preservatives.

Although prior animal toxicology studies have shown an association between triclosan and decreased testosterone levels, human studies have been limited, particularly for adult men. Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (NHANES, 2011-2012), we examined the association of urinary triclosan on testosterone levels in adult men 18-65 years of age. Multivariable linear regression analysis failed to show an association between triclosan and serum testosterone (β = 0.0003, p = 0.98, 95% CI = -0.024, 0.025).

While MXC exposure did not induce any differences in the weight gain of animals from birth to 4 months of age, a clear difference (although in opposite direction according to the sexes) was observed on the anogenital distance between intact and exposed animals. A similar effect was also observed on preputial separation and vaginal opening, which reflects, respectively, in males and females, puberty occurrence. The advanced puberty observed in females was associated with an enhanced expression of kisspeptin cells in the anteroventral periventricular region of the medial preoptic area. Exposure to MXC did not induce in adult females changes in the estrous cycle or in the weight of the female reproductive tract. By contrast, males showed reduced weight of the epididymis and seminiferous vesicles associated with reduced testosterone levels and seminiferous tubule diameter.

In birds, effects are similar to those caused by other xenoestrogens. Because of its endocrine disrupting activity, BPA is being substituted with other bisphenols in many applications. Using the chicken embryo model, we explored whether the BPA alternatives bisphenol AF (BPAF), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol S (BPS) can induce effects on reproductive organ development similar to those induced by BPA. Embryos were exposed in ovo from embryonic day 4 (E4) to vehicle, BPAF at 2.1, 21, 210, and 520 nmol/g egg, or to BPA, BPF, or BPS at 210 nmol/g egg and were dissected on embryonic day 19. Similar to BPA, BPAF and BPF induced testis feminization, manifested as eg testis-size asymmetry and ovarian-like cortex in the left testis. In the BPS-group, too few males were alive on day 19 to evaluate any effects on testis development. We found no effects by any treatment on ovaries or Müllerian ducts. BPAF and BPS increased the gallbladder-somatic index and BPAF, BPF and BPS caused increased embryo mortality. The overall lowest-observed-adverse-effect level for BPAF was 210 nmol/g egg based on increased mortality, increased gallbladder-somatic index, and various signs of testis feminization. This study demonstrates that the BPA replacements BPAF, BPF, and BPS are embryotoxic and suggests that BPAF is at least as potent as BPA in inducing estrogen-like effects in chicken embryos. Our results support the notion that these bisphenols are not safe alternatives to BPA.",PMC7706397

Compared to controls, the DBP exposed mice had lower expression of UCP1 and significantly higher expression of Bip and Chop, known markers of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. However, TUDCA treatment of DBP exposed mice returned these parameters nearly to the levels of the controls, with increased expression of UCP1, lower expression of Bip and Chop and ameliorated obesity.

In Florida, toxaphene and other organochlorine pesticides were used heavily in agriculture on the north shore of Lake Apopka and they are still detectable in soil. Wild largemouth bass that inhabit the lake and the marshes along the north shore have been exposed to a variety of organochlorine pesticides including dieldrin, methoxychlor, and p,p'-DDE, among others. While these other organochlorine pesticides have been studied for their endocrine disrupting effects in largemouth bass, there is little information for toxaphene. In this study, male and female largemouth bass were given food containing 50 mg/kg toxaphene for almost 3 months, to achieve tissue levels similar to those found in fish at Lake Apopka. Sex-specific toxicity was then evaluated by measuring various reproductive endpoints and transcriptomic changes. In females, gonadosomatic index showed a trend towards reduction (p = 0.051) and plasma vitellogenin was reduced by ~40% relative to controls. However plasma levels of 17β-estradiol and testosterone were not perturbed by toxaphene exposure. These data suggest that toxaphene does not act as a weak estrogen as many other organochlorine pesticides do, but rather appears to be acting as an antiestrogen in female fish. There were no obvious changes in the gonadosomatic index and plasma hormones in male bass. However, ex vivo explant experiments revealed that toxaphene prevented human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated testosterone production in the testis. This suggested that toxaphene had anti-androgenic effects in males. Subsequent transcriptomic analyses of the testis revealed that androgen receptor/beta-2-microglobulin signaling was up-regulated while insulin-related pathways were suppressed with toxaphene, which could be interpreted as a compensatory response to androgen suppression. In the male liver, the transcriptome analysis revealed an overwhelming suppression in immune-related signaling cascades (e.g. lectin-like receptor and ITSM-Containing Receptor signaling, CD16/CD14 Proinflammatory Monocyte Activation, and CD38/CD3-JUN/FOS/NF-kB Signaling in T-cell Proliferation). Overall, this study showed that toxaphene induced sex-specific effects.

We scrutinized this hypothesis by culturing zebrafish hepatocytes (ZF-L) on collagen-based hydrogels with controlled elastic moduli by examining morphology, urea production, and intracellular oxidative stress of hepatoids exposed to 17β-estradiol. Interestingly, the softer gel drove cells to form a cell sheet with a canaliculi-like structure compared to its stiffer gel counterpart. The hepatoids cultured on the softer gel exhibited more active urea production upon exposure to 17β-estradiol and displayed faster recovery of intracellular reactive oxygen species level confirmed by gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM), a live-cell imaging technique.

The algal acute biotoxicity results showed that the 24h-EC50 of DBP for C. vulgaris was 4.95 mg L-1, which caused a decrease in the chlorophyll a content and an increase in the DBP concentration of C. vulgaris. Proteomic analysis led to the identification of 1257 C. vulgaris proteins. Sixty-one more proteins showed increased expression, compared to proteins with decreased expression. This result illustrates that exposure to DBP generally enhances protein expression in C. vulgaris. GO annotation showed that both acetolactate synthase (ALS) and GDP-L-fucose synthase 2 (GER2) decreased more than 1.5-fold after exposure to DBP. These effects could inhibit both the valine biosynthetic process and the nucleotide-sugar metabolic process in C. vulgaris.

Crossbreeding of fish in F2 generation indicated subfertility in males. To further understand the mechanisms underlying BPA or EE2-induced adult onset and transgenerational reproductive defects in males, the present study examined the expression of genes regulating the brain-pituitary-testis (BPT) axis in the same F0 and F2 generation male medaka. Embryonic exposure to BPA or EE2 led to hyperactivation of brain and pituitary genes, which are actively involved in reproduction in adulthood of the F0 generation male fish, and some of these F0 effects continued to the F2 generation (transgenerational effects). Particularly, the F2 generation inherited the hyperactivated state of expression for kisspeptin (kiss1 and kiss2) and their receptors (kiss1r and kiss2r), and gnrh and gnrh receptors. At F2 generation, expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) decreased in brain of the BPA treatment lineage, while EE2 treatment lineage showed increased dnmt3bb expression.

In particular, exposure of the developing testis to exogenous estrogen can negatively impact male reproductive health. To determine how estrogens impact human gonad function, we treated the human testis-derived cell line NT2/D1 with estrogen and examined its impact on SOX9 and the expression of key markers of granulosa (ovarian) and Sertoli (testicular) cell development. Estrogen successfully activated its cognate receptor (estrogen receptor alpha; ESR1) in NT2/D1 cells. We observed a significant increase in cytoplasmic SOX9 following estrogen treatment. After 48 h of estrogen exposure, mRNA levels of the key Sertoli cell genes SOX9, SRY, AMH, FGF9 and PTGDS were significantly reduced. This was followed by a significant increase in mRNA levels for the key granulosa cell genes FOXL2 and WNT4 after 96 h of estrogen exposure. These results are consistent with estrogen's effects on marsupial gonads and show that estrogen has a highly conserved impact on gonadal cell fate decisions that has existed in mammals for over 160 million years.

The global brain gene expression profile was altered permanently by BPA treatment and showed regional and sexual differences. The BPA-treated male mice had more changes in the hippocampus, while female mice experienced more changes in the cortex. Overall, we demonstrate that in utero exposure to BPA induces permanent changes in brain gene expression in a region-specific and sex-specific manner, including a significant decrease in locomotor activity, learning ability, long-term memory, and an increase in anxiety. Fetal/early life exposures permanently affect neurobehavioral functions that deteriorate with age; BPA exposure may compound the effects of aging.",PMC7609133

In this study, human adrenocortical carcinoma (NCI-H295R) cell line was used as an in vitro biological model to study the effect of nickel chloride (NiCl2) on the viability and steroidogenesis. The cells were exposed to different concentrations (3.90; 7.80; 15.60; 31.20; 62.50; 125; 250 and 500 microM) of NiCl2 and compared with control group (culture medium without NiCl2). The cell viability was measured by the metabolic activity assay. Production of sexual steroid hormones was quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Following 48 h culture of the cells in the presence of NiCl2 a dose-dependent depletion of progesterone release was observed even at the lower concentrations. In fact, lower levels of progesterone were detected in groups with higher doses (>/=125 microM) of NiCl2 (P<0.01), which also elicited cytotoxic action. A more prominent decrease in testosterone production (P<0.01) was also noted in comparison to that of progesterone. On the other hand, the release of 17beta-estradiol was substantially increased at low concentrations (3.90 to 62.50 microM) of NiCl2. The cell viability remained relatively unaltered up to 125 microM (P>0.05) and slightly decreased from 250 microM of NiCl2 (P<0.05). Our results indicate endocrine disruptive effect of NiCl2 on the release of progesterone and testosterone in the NCI-H295R cell line. Although no detrimental effect of NiCl2 (</=62.50 microM) could be found on 17beta-estradiol production, its toxicity may reflect at other points of the steroidogenic pathway.",PMC8549914

Of particular concern are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). An important target of EDCs is nuclear receptors (NRs) that control endocrine and metabolic responses through transcriptional regulation. Owing in part to structural differences of NRs, adverse effects of EDCs vary significantly among species. Here, we describe a multiplexed reporter assay (the Ecotox FACTORIAL) enabling parallel assessment of compounds' effects on estrogen, androgen, thyroid, and PPARγ receptors of representative mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. The Ecotox FACTORIAL is a single-well assay comprising a set of species-specific, one-hybrid GAL4-NR reporter constructs transiently transfected into test cells. To harmonize cross-species assessments, we used a combination of two approaches. First, we used the same type of test cells for all reporters; second, we implemented a parallel detection of reporter RNAs. The assay demonstrated excellent quality, reproducibility, and insignificant intra-assay variability. Importantly, the EC50 values for NR ligands were consistent with those reported for conventional assays. Using the assay allowed ranking the hazard potential of environmental pollutants (e.g., bisphenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and synthetic progestins) across species. Furthermore, the assay permitted detecting taxa-specific effects of surface water samples. Therefore, the Ecotox FACTORIAL enables harmonized assessment of the endocrine and metabolic disrupting activity of chemicals and surface water in humans as well as in wildlife species.",PMC11285471

Our previous studies in mice show disruption of metabolic health upon maternal BPA exposure. The current study was undertaken to determine whether exposure in fathers causes adverse metabolic consequences in offspring. Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to BPA in the diet beginning at 5 weeks of age resulting in the following dietary exposure groups: Control (0 μg/kg/day), Lower BPA (10 μg/kg/day) and Upper BPA (10 mg/kg/day). After 12 weeks of dietary exposure, males were mated to control females. Mothers and offspring were maintained on the control diet. Post-pubertal paternal BPA exposure did not affect offspring body weight, body composition or glucose tolerance. However, when fathers were exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation, their female offspring displayed impaired glucose tolerance in the absence of compromised in vivo insulin sensitivity or reduced ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Male offspring exhibited normal glucose tolerance. Taken together, these studies show there is an early window of susceptibility in which paternal BPA exposure can cause sex-specific impairments in glucose homeostasis.",PMC7554185

Many peer-reviewing studies have reported adverse effects of low dose BPA exposure, particularly during perinatal period (gestation and/or lactation). We previously demonstrated that perinatal oral exposure to BPA (via gavage of mothers during gestation and lactation) has long-term consequences on immune response and intestinal barrier functions. Due to its adverse effects on several developmental and physiological processes, BPA was removed from consumer products and replaced by chemical substitutes such as BPS or BPF, that are structurally similar and not well studied compare to BPA. Here, we aimed to compare perinatal oral exposure to these bisphenols (BPs) at two doses (5 and 50 μg/kg of body weight (BW)/day (d)) on immune response at intestinal and systemic levels in female offspring mice at adulthood (Post Natal Day PND70). Pregnant female mice were orally exposed to BPA, BPS or BPF at 5 or 50 μg/kg BW/d from 15th day of gravidity to weaning of pups at Post-Natal Day (PND) 21. Humoral and cellular immune responses of adult offspring (PND70) were analysed at intestinal and systemic levels. In female offspring, perinatal oral BP exposure led to adverse effects on intestinal and systemic immune response that were dependant of the BP nature (A, S or F) and dose of exposure. Stronger impacts were observed with BPS at the dose of 5 μg/kg BW/d on inflammatory markers in feces associated with an increase of anti-E. coli IgG in plasma. BPA and BPF exposure induced prominent changes at low dose in offspring mice, in term of intestinal and systemic immune responses, provoking an intestinal and systemic Th1/Th17 inflammation. These findings provide, for the first time, results of long-time consequences of BPA, S and F perinatal exposure by oral route on immune response in offspring mice.

This method used solid-phase extraction with an elution solvent of acetonitrile to improve the stability of the analytes. To maintain the stability of analytes analyses were completed within five days. The recoveries ranged from 84 to 112% and the relative standard deviation of analysis of duplicate samples was <10%. The limits of quantitation were 1-10 ng/L. Surface water and wastewater were obtained from five wastewater treatment plants in Saskatchewan. Matrix effects were moderate to severe. Using standard addition calibration, all analytes except diethylstilbestrol and 17α-ethinyl estradiol were detected. There was a low frequency of detection of the target analytes in upstream and downstream water, indicating good removal efficiency during the wastewater treatment process. Bisphenol A and 4-nonylphenol were the only analytes detected downstream. Bisphenol A was the most frequently detected in raw wastewater (133 to 403 ng/L).

PAHs have been implicated as endocrine disrupting compounds in previous animal and in vitro studies, but human studies are currently lacking. Pregnant women and their developing fetuses are particularly susceptible populations to environmental contaminants, in part because alterations in hormone physiology during gestation can have adverse consequences on the health of the pregnancy. We utilized data on 659 pregnant women from the PROTECT longitudinal birth cohort in Puerto Rico to assess associations between repeated measures of 8 urinary hydroxylated PAH (OH-PAH) metabolites and 9 serum hormones during gestation. Urine samples were collected at 3 study visits (median gestational ages of 18, 22, and 26 weeks at each visit, respectively) and serum samples were collected at the first and third study visits. Linear mixed effects models were used to ascertain longitudinal associations between OH-PAHs and hormones, and sensitivity analyses were employed to assess potential nonlinearity and differences in associations on the basis of fetal sex and timing of biomarker measurement. Among the multiple positive associations we observed between OH-PAHs and CRH, estriol, progesterone, T3, and the ratio of T3 to T4, and inverse associations with testosterone, the most notable are a 24.3% increase (95% CI: 13.0, 36.7) in CRH with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in 1-hydroxyphenanthrene and a 17.2% decrease (95% CI: 8.13, 25.4) in testosterone with an IQR increase in 1-hydroxynapthalene.

Limited available evidence suggests that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may perturb these developmental processes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), Aroclor 1221, would disrupt the normal timing of neurogenesis in two hypothalamic regions: the ventromedial nucleus (VMN) and the preoptic area (POA). These regions were selected because of their important roles in the control of sociosexual behaviors that are perturbed in adulthood by prenatal EDC exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to PCBs from Embryonic Day 8 (E8) to E18, encompassing the period of neurogenesis of all hypothalamic neurons. To determine the birth dates of neurons, bromo-2-deoxy-5-uridine (BrdU) was administered to dams on E12, E14, or E16. On the day after birth, male and female pups were perfused, brains immunolabeled for BrdU, and numbers of cells counted. In the VMN, exposure to PCBs significantly advanced the timing of neurogenesis compared to vehicle-treated pups, without changing the total number of BrdU+ cells. In the POA, PCBs did not change the timing of neurogenesis nor the total number of cells born. This is the first study to show that PCBs can shift the timing of neurogenesis in the hypothalamus, specifically in the VMN but not the POA.

Among the tested compounds, only glyphosate inhibited aromatase activity (up to 30%) via a non-competitive inhibition or a mixed inhibition mechanism depending on the concentration applied. Then, the ability of the three pesticides to induce an estrogenic activity was tested in MELN cells. When compared to 17β-estradiol, thiacloprid and imidacloprid induced an estrogenic activity at the highest concentrations tested with a relative potency of 5.4 × 10-10 and 3.7 × 10-9, respectively. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations predicted the potential binding sites and the binding mode of the three pesticides on the structure of the two key targets, providing a rational for their mechanism as EDCs.

A1221 is a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (weakly estrogenic) while vinclozolin is a fungicide (anti-androgenic). Adult male offspring exposed to A1221 or vinclozolin, and females exposed to A1221, had impaired mate preference behavior when given a choice between 2 opposite-sex rats that differed by hormone status. A similar pattern of impairment was observed in an odor preference test for urine-soaked filter paper from the same rat groups. A habituation/dishabituation test revealed that all rats had normal odor discrimination ability. Because of the importance of the ventrolateral portion of the ventromedial nucleus (VMNvl) in mate choice, expression of the immediate early gene product Fos was measured, along with its co-expression in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) cells.

Results showed that DEHP exposed mice livers exhibited significant changes in global DNA methylation levels in all three generations, with the effect being different in F2 after high dosage exposure. Histopathology indicated that DEHP exposure could induce mild damage in F1 livers. The expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) were significantly changed in both the F1 and F2 generations at PND 8, suggesting that maintenance Dnmt1 plays a major role in the multigenerational effect that occur in the early developmental stages. Additionally, DEHP exposure caused significant changes in ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine (Tet) dioxygenases encoding Tet1 expression in all three generations and Tet2 expression in F3 at PND 60, implicating their contributions in inducing both multi- and transgenerational effects after DEHP exposure in mouse liver. Overall, our results establish that prenatal and ancestral DEHP exposure are critical for epigenetic regulation of DNA methylation in female mouse livers.",PMC9374193

Bisphenol A (BPA) and 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) are ubiquitous EDCs in the environment. Many aquatic organisms, including fish, are often exposed to varying concentrations of BPA and EE2 throughout their lifespan. Both BPA and EE2 can activate estrogenic signaling pathways and cause adverse effects on reproduction via alteration of pathways associated with steroidogenesis. However, transcriptional pathways that are affected by chronic exposure to these two ubiquitous environmental estrogens during embryonic, larval, and juvenile stages are not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined transcriptional alterations in the testis of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) chronically exposed to a low concentration of BPA or EE2. Medaka were exposed to BPA (10 μg/L) or EE2 (0.01 μg/L) from 8 h post-fertilization (as embryos) to adulthood 50 days post fertilization (dpf), and transcriptional alterations in the testis were examined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Transcriptomic profiling revealed 651 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BPA-exposed and control testes, while 1475 DEGs were found between EE2-exposed and control testes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed a significant enrichment of ""intracellular receptor signaling pathway"", ""response to steroid hormone"" and ""hormone-mediated signaling pathway"" in the BPA-induced DEGs, and of ""cilium organization"", ""microtubule-based process"" and ""organelle assembly"" in the EE2-induced DEGs. Pathway analysis showed significant enrichment of ""integrin signaling pathway"" in both treatment groups, and of ""cadherin signaling pathway"", ""Alzheimer disease-presenilin pathway"" in EE2-induced DEGs. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and insertion-deletion (Indel) analysis found no significant differences in mutation rates with either BPA or EE2 treatments. Taken together, global gene expression differences in testes of medaka during early stages of gametogenesis were responsive to chronic BPA and EE2 exposure.",PMC7387123

Various behaviors, gut microbiota, and fecal metabolome were assessed at 90 days of age. The LD but not UD of BPA exposure resulted in individuals spending more time engaging in repetitive behaviors. GEN exposed individuals were more likely to exhibit such behaviors and showed socio-communicative disturbances.

Moreover, potential risks of GO in aquatic life are inadequately explored. Present study was designed to evaluate GO as an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) using the model Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). GO was injected intraperitoneally (25-200 μg/g) once to breeding pairs and continued pair breeding an additional 21 days. Eggs laid were analyzed for fecundity and the fertilized eggs were evaluated for developmental abnormalities including hatching. Histopathological evaluation of gonads, liver, and kidneys was made 21 days post-injection. LD50 was found to be sex-dependent. Fecundity tended to reduce in a dose-dependent manner during early post-injection days; however, the overall evaluation showed no significant difference. The hatchability of embryos was reduced significantly in the 200 μg/g group; edema (yolk and cardiovascular) and embryo-mortality remained unaltered. Histopathological assessment identified black particles, probably agglomerated GO, in the gonads of GO-treated fish. However, folliculogenesis in stromal compartments of ovary and the composition of germinal elements in testis remained almost unaltered. Moreover, granulosa and Leydig cells morphology did not indicate any significant EDC-related effects. Although liver and kidney histopathology did not show GO as an EDC, some GO-treated fish accumulated proteinaceous fluid in hepatic vessels and induced hyperplasia in interstitial lymphoid cells (HIL) located in kidneys. GO agglomerated in medaka gonads after 21-days post-injection.

These endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to various diseases, including reproductive disorders, metabolic diseases, and developmental abnormalities, among others. Exposure to EDCs arises from industrial activity, use of personal and home care products, and consumption of contaminated food and water; however, the role of healthcare in exposing individuals to EDCs is grossly underappreciated. Indeed, through the use of medications as well as medical equipment and devices, healthcare providers are unknowing mediators of exposure to EDCs, chemicals that might not only promote disease but that may also antagonize the efficacy of treatments. The ethical implications of provider-dependent exposure are profound. A failure to disclose the endocrine-disrupting properties of medical interventions violates core principles of nonmaleficence, patient autonomy, and justice as well as the practice of informed consent. Furthermore, physicians' lack of knowledge regarding EDCs in medical practice artificially skews risk-benefit calculations that are fundamental to informed medical decision-making. To combat this underappreciated ethical challenge, urgent action is required. Healthcare providers must be educated about endocrine disruption. Known EDCs, defined by endocrinologists, should be clearly labeled on all medical products, and all medication components and devices should be screened for endocrine-disrupting properties. Finally, communication strategies must be devised to empower patients with knowledge about these risks. Providing ethically competent care requires an open acknowledgment of endocrine risks imposed by the medical community that have heretofore been ignored.",PMC7442273

Previous studies have indicated that EEDs may contribute to oncogenesis. This study explores the relationship between EEDs and pediatric germ cell tumors (GCTs). A case-control study was conducted in 84 pediatric patients from 2014 to 2017, including 42 subjects with immature teratoma, yolk sac tumor, or germinoma, and 42 controls who experienced pneumonia or trauma. Serum PFASs, including PFBS, PFHpA, PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, PFUA, PFOSA, and PFDoA, were measured in each subject, and their history of possible EED exposure was reviewed. Six of the 10 measured PFASs were significantly increased in the GCT group relative to the control group. With respect to lifestyle history, only PFHxS levels were statistically significantly associated with GCTs as determined by logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio for a 1 ng/L increase in PFHxS was 19.47 (95% CI: 4.20-90.26). Furthermore, in the GCT and control groups, both parental consumption of barbecued foods and hair dye use among parents were significantly correlated with elevated serum PFHxS levels (ρ = 0.383, 0.325 in the patient group and ρ = 0.370, 0.339 in the control group; p < 0.05).

During 2012-2013, 218 pregnant women were enrolled at late pregnancy from Shanghai, China. Urinary BPA concentration was measured in prenatal and child 2-year spot urine samples, and classified into high, medium and low tertiles. Child adiposity anthropometric measurements, random morning plasma glucose, serum insulin, and lipids (high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, cholesterol, triglyceride), systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured. Linear regression was used to evaluate the associations between prenatal BPA and each of the cardio-metabolic risk factors in boys and girls, respectively, adjusting for pertinent prenatal, perinatal and postnatal factors. BPA was detectable (>0.1 μg/L) in 98.2% of mothers prenatally and 99.4% of children at age 2 years. Compared to those with low prenatal BPA, mean SBP was 7.0 (95%CI: 2.9-11.2) mmHg higher, and DBP was 4.4 (95%CI: 1.2-7.5) mmHg higher in girls with high prenatal BPA levels, but these associations were not found in boys. In boys, medium maternal prenatal BPA level was associated with 0.36 (95% CI: 0.04-0.68) mmol/L higher plasma glucose. No associations were found between prenatal BPA and child BMI, skinfold thicknesses, serum lipids, or insulin in either girls or boys. There were no associations between concurrent child urinary BPA and cardio-metabolic risk factors.

Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), a flame retardant that has an estrogen-like effect in vitro, is present in house dust at high concentrations. Estrogen exposure during development has significant influences on reproductive behavior in rodents, and its effects persist until maturity. In the present study, we investigated the effect of early life exposure to TPhP on the reproductive behavior of female rats. Oral treatment with TPhP (25 or 250 mg/kg), ethinyl estradiol (EE; 15 μg/kg) as a positive control, or sesame oil as a negative control, were given to female rats (from birth to 28 days of age). The 8-week-old rats were bilaterally ovariectomized. At 12-15 weeks of age, the rats were subjected to odor preference and sexual behavior tests. In the odor preference test, the oil group showed significantly higher preference for male odor than female odor, but the low-dose TPhP treatment group lost the preference for male odor, indicating a possible outcome of early life TPhP exposure on sexual recognition. In the sexual behavior test, both the EE and TPhP treatment groups displayed significantly less proceptive behavior. These results suggest that early life exposure to TPhP disturbs the normal sexual behavior of female rats.",PMC7687172

However, how these two EDCs would affect fetal rat testis development at a low dose was rarely studied. In this study, we established the organ culture system and applied it to evaluate testicular effects following multiple EDC exposure at a low dose. 15.5 days postcoitum fetal rat testes were dissected, cultured, and exposed to vehicle (control), GEN (1 μmol/L, G), MEHP (1 μmol/L, M), or GEN (1 μmol/L)+MEHP (1 μmol/L, G+M). Testicular cell markers, testosterone concentration, redox state, testicular histology, and testicular ultrastructure were evaluated. Our results showed that a low dose of MEHP suppressed the development of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and gonocytes by triggering oxidative injuries, which was consistent with the ultrastructural findings. However, coadministration of genistein at a low dose could partially attenuate MEHP-induced fetal testis damage through antioxidative action. Cotreatment of genistein at a low dose may have a promising future on its protecting role for attenuating other EDC-induced reproductive disorders during early life. Based on the results, it can be speculated that dietary intake of isoflavones may make the fetal testis less susceptible to phthalate-induced injury.",PMC7275205

We have captured single-cell distributions of androgen receptor (AR) nuclear levels after perturbations as a means to evaluate assay reproducibility and characterize a small subset of chemicals. AR, a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, is the central regulator of male reproduction and is involved in many pathophysiological processes. AR protein levels and nuclear localization often increase following ligand binding, with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) being the natural agonist. HT AR immunofluorescence imaging was used in multiple cell lines to define single-cell nuclear values extracted from thousands of cells per condition treated with DHT or DMSO (control). Analysis of numerous biological replicates led to a quality control metric that takes into account the distribution of single-cell data, and how it changes upon treatments. Dose-response experiments across several cell lines showed a large range of sensitivity to DHT, prompting us to treat selected cell lines with 45 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-provided chemicals that include many endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs); data from six of the compounds were then integrated with orthogonal assays.

Acid activation technique was opted for modifying natural bentonite (NB) to enhance the adsorptive removal of CIP from water. The BET surface area analysis revealed that acid-activated bentonite (AAB) possessed more than two fold higher surface area as compared to NB. Combining pHzpc measurements, effect of solution pH and CIP speciation revealed that CIP sorption onto bentonite is highly dependent on solution pH. Kinetic studies confirmed that CIP sorption mechanism was chemisorption which included ion-exchange and surface complexation mechanisms. The mechanism of CIP sorption onto AAB was successfully explored with the assistance of characterization techniques.

However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted.",PMC7367909

We determined that TCS can impair dendrite and axon growth by reducing average length and numbers of axons and dendrites. Additionally, TCS inhibited the proliferation of and promoted apoptosis in neuronal progenitor cells. Detailed behavioral analyses showed impaired acquisition of spatial learning and reference memory in offspring derived from dams exposed to TCS. The TCS-treated groups also showed cognition dysfunction and impairments in sociability and social novelty preference. Furthermore, TCS-treated groups exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior, but there was no significant change in depression-like behaviors.

Several PFAS have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that PFAS exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for women's health. This review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between PFAS exposure and ovarian function. A comprehensive review was performed by searching PubMed. Search terms included an extensive list of PFAS and health terms ranging from general keywords (e.g. ovarian, reproductive, follicle, oocyte) to specific keywords (including menarche, menstrual cycle, menopause, primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure, steroid hormones), based on the authors' knowledge of the topic and key terms. Clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of PFAS in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the blood-follicle barrier. Although some studies found no evidence associating PFAS exposure with disruption in ovarian function, numerous epidemiologic studies, mostly with cross-sectional study designs, have identified associations of higher PFAS exposure with later menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, longer cycle length, earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens. Adverse effects of PFAS on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models. Based on laboratory research findings, PFAS could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells, inducing thyroid hormone deficiency, antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus. The published literature supports associations between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes; however, the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between PFAS exposure and ovarian disorders. Thus, more research is warranted. PFAS are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans. Moreover, susceptible groups, such as foetuses and pregnant women, may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include PFAS. However, the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community. To better understand the potential risk of PFAS on human ovarian function, additional experimental studies using PFAS doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required. Prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of PFAS exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality.",PMC7456353

To simulate human exposure under experimental conditions, 8-week-old outbred ICR male mice received 8 weeks of drinking water containing a broad range of BPS doses [0.001, 1.0, or 100 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day, BPS1-3] or vehicle control.

The results indicate that compared to vehicle, 100 μg/kg/day exposure (BPS3) leads to 1) significant histopathology in testicular tissue; and, 2) higher levels of the histone protein γH2AX, a reliable marker of DNA damage. There were fewer mature spermatozoa in the germ layer in the experimental group treated with 1 μg/kg bw (BPS2). Finally, western blot and MALDI-TOF MS studies showed significant alterations in the sperm acetylome and phosphorylome in mice treated with the lowest exposure (0.001 μg/kg/day; BPS1), although the dose is several times lower than what has been published so far.

Thirteen chemicals had calculable EDs in the L-YES or P-YES, with average EDs 13-fold (range 0.63-36) more potent in P-YES than in the L-YES. Normalized to E2, the median estrogenicity was within 1.5-fold (0.43-8.8) between the assays. Therefore, P-YES was as or more sensitive than L-YES but potencies relative to E2 were comparable between assays. With chromatography, the P-YES detected estrogenicity in coated metal cans, effects that were unmeasurable in L-YES. With the sample preparation methods used in this study, both YES assays are sufficiently sensitive to detect bisphenol A below the specific migration limit for plastic packaging (0.05 mg/kg food). This study demonstrates that P-YES outperforms L-YES because it is more sensitive, provides comparable estradiol equivalents, and circumvents confounding mixture effects. The P-YES will be useful for routine monitoring of FCM and toxicant identification in problematic materials. Graphical abstract.",PMC7329773

While visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) are implicated in the development of metabolic syndrome, the adipose depot-specific effects of prenatal BPA treatment are poorly understood. To determine the impact of prenatal BPA exposure on genome-wide gene expression of VAT and SAT depots. RNA sequencing was performed on SAT and VAT from 21-month old control and prenatal BPA-treated female sheep. Gene expression and pathway differences between SAT and VAT depots with or without prenatal BPA-treatment and the effect of prenatal BPA treatment on each depot were tested. There were 179 differentially expressed genes (padjusted < 0.05, log2-fold change >2.5) between SAT and VAT. Development and immune response pathways were upregulated in SAT, while metabolic pathways were upregulated in VAT. These adipose depot-specific genes and pathways were consistent with prenatal BPA-treatment. In SAT, BPA-treatment resulted in differential expression of 108 genes (78% upregulated with BPA) and altered pathways (immune response downregulated, RNA processing upregulated). In contrast in VAT, BPA-treatment differentially expressed 4 genes and upregulated chromatin and RNA processing pathways. Prenatal BPA-treatment induces adult depot-specific alterations in RNA expression in inflammation, RNA processing, and chromatin pathways, reflecting the diverse roles of SAT and VAT in regulating lipid storage and insulin sensitivity. These adipose tissue transcriptional dysregulations may contribute to the metabolic disorders observed in prenatal BPA-treated female sheep.",PMC7418632

The peroxidase and protease activities decreased as the spermatogenesis of the first reproductive cycle (RC) proceeded in control fish. However, only protease and antiprotease activities showed different level at different stages of the second RC in control fish, but showed scarce disruption in fish treated with EE2 or Tmx.

We hypothesized that early bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) exposures would be associated with sex-dependent changes in preschool executive function. A subsample of the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) cohort (n = 312) provided maternal second trimester (prenatal) and 3-month postpartum (postnatal) urine samples, from which BPA and BPS concentrations were quantified. When children were age 2 and 4, mothers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P). Changes in standardized T scores on the BRIEF-P indexes of inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and emergent metacognition were investigated. Adjusted multivariate regression analyses showed that child sex modified the associations between maternal postnatal BPA and changes in executive function. Higher maternal postnatal BPA concentrations predicted increasing difficulties from age 2 to 4 in the domains of inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition in female, but not male children. The other bisphenol concentrations were not associated with changes in executive function. Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, these findings justify further investigation on the effects of postnatal bisphenol exposure on child cognitive development. Higher concentrations of maternal BPA at 3-month postpartum were associated with increasing difficulties in inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition from age 2 to 4 in girls, but not boys. Prenatal BPA and prenatal/postnatal BPS were not significant predictors of changes in executive function in boys and girls. The current study extends previous research to show that maternal postnatal BPA could also impact child executive function. Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, the current findings suggest that additional precautions may be needed to protect infants' neurodevelopment from indirect exposure to BPA.",PMC7666018

These studies generally use costly low-throughput mammalian models. Zebrafish, however, offer an excellent alternative due to their rapid development, ease of maintenance, and homology to mammalian immune system function and development. Larval zebrafish also are a convenient model to study the innate immune system with no interference from the adaptive immune system. In this study, a respiratory burst assay (RBA) was utilized to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after developmental xenobiotic exposure. Embryos were exposed to non-teratogenic doses of chemicals and at 96 h post-fertilization, the ability to produce ROS was measured. Using the RBA, 12 compounds with varying immune-suppressive properties were screened. Seven compounds neither suppressed nor enhanced the respiratory burst; five reproducibly suppressed global ROS production, but with varying potencies: benzo[a]pyrene, 17β-estradiol, lead acetate, methoxychlor, and phenanthrene. These five compounds have all previously been reported as immunosuppressive in mammalian innate immunity assays. To evaluate whether the suppression of ROS by these compounds was a result of decreased immune cell numbers, flow cytometry with transgenic zebrafish larvae was used to count the numbers of neutrophils and macrophages after chemical exposure. With this assay, benzo[a]pyrene was found to be the only chemical that induced a change in the number of immune cells by increasing macrophage but not neutrophil numbers. Taken together, this work demonstrates the utility of zebrafish larvae as a vertebrate model for identifying compounds that impact innate immune function at non-teratogenic levels and validates measuring ROS production and phagocyte numbers as metrics for monitoring how xenobiotic exposure alters the innate immune system.",PMC7405951

Studies using standardized measurement techniques that describe demographic and clinical variability in these endpoints are lacking. Three hundred and eighty-eight healthy term newborns <3 days old were evaluated, 69% African American and 25% White. Measures included breast bud diameter, anogenital distance (AGD), stretched penile length (SPL), and testicular volume (TV). Breast buds were larger in females than males bilaterally (right: 13.0 ± 4.0 vs. 12.0 ± 4.0 mm, p = 0.008; left: 13.0 ± 4.0 vs. 11.0 ± 3.0 mm, p < 0.001).

As part of understanding this risk, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been pursuing new high-throughput in vitro assays and computational models to characterize EDCs. EPA models have incorporated our high-content analysis-based green fluorescent protein estrogen receptor (GFP-ER): PRL-HeLa assay, which allows direct visualization of ER binding to DNA regulatory elements. Here, we characterize a modified functional assay based on the stable expression of a chimeric androgen receptor (ARER), wherein a region containing the native AR DNA-binding domain (DBD) was replaced with the ERα DBD (amino acids 183-254). We demonstrate that the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone induces GFP-ARER nuclear translocation, PRL promoter binding, and transcriptional activity at physiologically relevant concentrations (<1 nM). In contrast, the AR antagonist bicalutamide induces only nuclear translocation of the GFP-ARER receptor (at μM concentrations). Estradiol also fails to induce visible chromatin binding, indicating androgen specificity. In a screen of reference chemicals from the EPA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the GFP-ARER cell model identified and mechanistically grouped activity by known (anti-)androgens based on the ability to induce nuclear translocation and/or chromatin binding. Finally, the cell model was used to identify potential (anti-)androgens in environmental samples in collaboration with the Houston Ship Channel/Galveston Bay Texas A&M University EPA Superfund Research Program. Based on these data, the chromatin-binding, in vitro assay-based GFP-ARER model represents a selective tool for rapidly identifying androgenic activity associated with drugs, chemicals, and environmental samples.",PMC7477889

Despite numerous studies establishing this linkage, the long-term molecular changes that predispose mammary cells to carcinogenic transformation are unknown. Herein, we investigated how endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) drive changes within the stroma that can contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. We utilized bisphenol A (BPA) as a model of estrogenic endocrine disruption to analyze the long-term consequences in the stroma. Deregulated genes were identified by RNA-seq transcriptional profiling of adult primary fibroblasts, isolated from female mice exposed to in utero BPA. Collagen staining, collagen imaging techniques, and permeability assays were used to characterize changes to the extracellular matrix. Finally, gland stiffness tests were performed on exposed and control mammary glands. We identified significant transcriptional deregulation of adult fibroblasts exposed to in utero BPA. Deregulated genes were associated with cancer pathways and specifically extracellular matrix composition. Multiple collagen genes were more highly expressed in the BPA-exposed fibroblasts resulting in increased collagen deposition in the adult mammary gland. This transcriptional reprogramming of BPA-exposed fibroblasts generates a less permeable extracellular matrix and a stiffer mammary gland. These phenotypes were only observed in adult 12-week-old, but not 4-week-old, mice. Additionally, diethylstilbestrol, known to increase breast cancer risk in humans, also increases gland stiffness similar to BPA, while bisphenol S does not. As breast stiffness, extracellular matrix density, and collagen deposition have been directly linked to breast cancer risk, these data mechanistically connect EDC exposures to molecular alterations associated with increased disease susceptibility. These alterations develop over time and thus contribute to cancer risk in adulthood.",PMC7201668

In this work, adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were immersed into MC-LR solutions at concentrations of 0, 1, 5 and 25 μg/L for 30 d, respectively. The results showed that persistent MC-LR exposure caused an extensive upregulation of HPI-axis genes but an inhibition of brain nuclear receptors (gr and mr), which finally increased serum cortisol levels. Furthermore, the decreased expression of hepatic gr might partly be responsible for the strong inhibition on the expression of downstream genes involved in glucose metabolic enzymes, including gluconeogenesis-related genes (pepck, fbp1a, g6pca), glycogenolysis-related gene (pyg), glycolysis-related genes (gk, pfk1b, pk) and glycogenesis-related gene (gys2). These findings are in accordance with the decline in serum glucose, indicating that long-term MC-LR exposure caused a lower production of glucose relative to glucose lysis.

Pregnant mice were subcutaneously injected with BPA (0, 50, 500 ng/kg and 250 µg/kg BW) daily between gestational days 11-19. Female offspring were examined for mammary tumorigenesis, puberty onset, mammary morphogenesis, and signaling in ER and erbB2 pathways. In utero exposure to low dose BPA (500 ng/kg) induced mammary tumorigenesis, earlier puberty onset, increased terminal end buds, and prolonged estrus phase, which was accompanied by proliferative mammary morphogenesis. CD24/49f-based FACS analysis showed that in utero exposure to 500 ng/kg BPA induced expansion of luminal and basal/myoepithelial cell subpopulations at PND 35. Molecular analysis of mammary tissues at PND 70 showed that in utero exposure to low doses of BPA induced upregulation of ERα, p-ERα, cyclin D1, and c-myc, concurrent activation of erbB2, EGFR, erbB-3, Erk1/2, and Akt, and upregulation of growth factors/ligands.

Because of the existence of close interconnections between the different steroid hormone receptors with overlapping ligand specificities and signaling pathways, in this study, we wanted to investigate a possible effect of estrogenic active compounds, namely 17β-estradiol, diethylstilbestrol, and zearalenone, on RACK-1 expression and innate immune responses using THP-1 cells as experimental model. All compounds increased RACK1 transcriptional activity as evaluated by reporter luciferase activity, mRNA expression as assessed by real time-PCR and protein expression by western blot analysis, which paralleled an increase in LPS-induced IL-8, TNF-α production, and CD86 expression, which we previously demonstrated to be dependent on RACK1/PKCβ activation. As the induction of RACK1 expression can be blocked by the antagonist G15, induced by the agonist G1 and by the non-cell permeable 17β-estradiol conjugated with BSA, a role of GPER (previously named GPR30) activation in estrogen-induced RACK1 expression could be demonstrated. In addition, a role of androgen receptor (AR) in RACK1 transcription was also demonstrated by the ability of flutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, to completely prevent diethylstilbestrol-induced RACK1 transcriptional activity and protein expression. Altogether, our data suggest that RACK1 may represent an interesting target of steroid-active compounds, and its evaluation may offer the opportunity to screen the immunotoxic potential of hormone-active substances.",3195729

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers were used as the major FR until 2004, when they were replaced by organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Previous research in rodent models utilizing a commercial flame retardant mixture containing OPFRs reported alterations in anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) for rodents perinatally exposed to OPFRs.

These mice were evaluated for anxiety-like behavior in adulthood on the open field test (OFT) and the light/dark box (LDB) as well as the EPM. Outcomes from the OFT and LDB indicate that males and females maternally exposed to OPFRs exhibit altered locomotor activity. Results of the EPM were sex-specific as we did not observe an effect in females; however, effects in males differed depending on exposure condition. Males maternally exposed to OPFRs exhibited an anxiolytic-like phenotype in contrast to their vehicle counterparts.

Using a case-control study nested within the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC, 1996-2002), we compared 220 pregnancies ending in miscarriage during weeks 12-22 of gestation, with 218 pregnancies resulting in live births. Levels of seven types of PFAS [PFOS, PFOA, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluoroheptane sulfonate (PFHpS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOSA)] were measured in maternal plasma collected in early gestation (mean gestational week 8). We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for miscarriage and each PFAS as a continuous variable or in quartiles, controlling for maternal age, parity, socio-occupational status, smoking and alcohol intake, gestational week of blood sampling, and maternal history of miscarriage. Stratification by parity and PFAS mixture analyses using weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression were also conducted. We observed a monotonic increase in odds for miscarriage associated with increasing PFOA and PFHpS levels. The ORs comparing the highest PFOA or PFHpS quartile to the lowest were 2.2 (95% CI: 1.2, 3.9) and 1.8 (95% CI: 1.0, 3.2).

The associations were stronger in parous women, while findings were inconsistent among nulliparous women. Maternal exposures to higher levels of PFOA, PFHpS, and PFAS mixtures were associated with the risk of miscarriage and particularly among parous women.

After 24 h of reperfusion, blood samples and hepatic tissues were collected for histopathological and biochemical examinations. The results suggested that 4 mg/kg BPA did not significantly alter the liver function, or Ang II and AT1R expression levels in the Sham and I/R groups. However, 4 mg/kg BPA inhibited E2‑mediated hepatic protection by enhancing hepatic necrosis, and increasing the release of alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin (P<0.05). Moreover, BPA increased serum and hepatic Ang II levels, as well as AT1R protein expression levels in the E2‑treated rat model of liver I/R injury (P<0.05). LOS treatment reversed the negative effects of BPA on hepatic necrosis and liver serum marker levels, although it did not reverse BPA‑mediated upregulation of serum and hepatic Ang II levels, or hepatic AT1R expression. Therefore, the present study suggested that BPA disrupted E2‑mediated hepatic protection following I/R injury, but did not significantly affect healthy or I/R‑injured livers; therefore, the mechanism underlying the effects of BPA may be associated with upregulation of the Ang II/AT1R signaling pathway.",PMC7248534

The participants had assessment of clinical parameters including HbA1c and carotid intima-media thickness and urinary heavy metals. Serum OP residues were extracted and quantified by GC-MS. Statistical analyses were performed to unravel the co-association of arsenic and OPs on prevalence of diabetes and atherosclerosis. On multivariate regression analyses, total organophosphate level and arsenic accumulation showed association with diabetes and atherosclerosis. Higher odds ratio with significant trends were observed for the sub-quartiles formed by the combination of higher quartiles of arsenic and total organophosphates in association with diabetes and atherosclerosis. We observed evidence of possible synergism between arsenic and OPs in association with prevalence of diabetes, pre-diabetes and atherosclerosis in the study population. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding health effects of mixed exposures and raises vital questions on the role of these agrochemicals in the etiology of diabetes and vascular diseases.",3121438

Exposure to individual per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can alter circulating thyroid hormone levels, but few studies have investigated effects of combined exposure to multiple PFAS. Estimate associations of exposure to multiple PFAS during early pregnancy with maternal and neonatal thyroid function. The study population consisted of 726 mothers and 465 neonates from Project Viva, a Boston, Massachusetts area longitudinal pre-birth cohort. We measured six PFAS [perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), 2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido)acetate (EtFOSAA), and 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido)acetate (MeFOSAA)] and thyroxine (T4), Free T4 Index (FT4I), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in maternal plasma samples collected during early pregnancy, and neonatal T4 in postpartum heel sticks. We estimated individual and joint effects of PFAS exposure with thyroid hormone levels using weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), and evaluated potential non-linearity and interactions among PFAS using BKMR. Higher concentrations of the PFAS mixture were associated with significantly lower maternal FT4I, with MeFOSAA, EtFOSAA, PFOA, and PFHxS contributing most to the overall mixture effect in BKMR and WQS regression. In infants, higher concentrations of the PFAS mixture were associated with lower T4 levels, primarily in males, with PFHxS and MeFOSAA contributing most in WQS, and PFHxS contributing most in BKMR. The PFAS mixture was not associated with maternal T4 or TSH levels. However, in maternal BKMR analyses, ln-PFOS was positively associated with T4 levels (Δ25th to 75th percentile: 0.21 µg/dL; 95% credible interval: -0.03, 0.47) and ln-PFHxS was associated with a non-linear effect on TSH levels. These findings support the hypothesis that there may be combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple PFAS on maternal and neonatal thyroid function, but the direction and magnitude of these effects may vary across individual PFAS.",PMC7282386

Early life exposure to EDCs may permanently alter phenotypes through to adulthood. In addition, the effects of EDCs may not be isolated to a single generation - offspring may indirectly be impacted, via non-genetic processes. Here, we analyzed the effects of paternal atrazine exposure on behavioral traits (distance moved, exploration, bottom-dwelling time, latency to enter the top zone, and interaction with a mirror) and whole-brain mRNA of genes involved in the serotonergic system regulation (slc6a4a, slc6a4b, htr1Aa, htr1B, htr2B) of zebrafish (Danio rerio). F0 male zebraFIsh were exposed to atrazine at 0.3, 3 or 30 part per billion (ppb) during early juvenile development, the behavior of F1 progeny was tested at adulthood, and the effect of 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment on mRNA transcription was quantified. Paternal exposure to atrazine significantly reduced interactions with a mirror (a proxy for aggression) and altered the latency to enter the top zone of a tank in unexposed F1 offspring. Bottom-dwelling time (a proxy for anxiety) also appeared to be somewhat affected, and activity (distance moved) was reduced in the context of aggression. slc6a4a and htr1Aa mRNA transcript levels were found to correlate positively with anxiety levels in controls, but we found that this relationship was disrupted in the 0.3 ppb atrazine treatment group. Overall, paternal atrazine exposure resulted in alterations across a variety of behavioral traits and showed signs of serotonergic system dysregulation, demonstrating intergenerational effects. Further research is needed to explore transgenerational effects on behavior and possible mechanisms underpinning behavioral effects.",PMC7147785

They are able to produce many bioactive metabolites, some of which are potentially endocrine disrupting compounds, i.e., compounds that interfere with the hormonal systems of animals and humans. Endocrine disruptors represent potential risks to both environmental and human health, making them a global challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential endocrine disrupting activities with emphasis on estrogenic effects of extracts from cultures of Microcystis or Planktothrix species. We also assessed the possible role of microcystins, some of the most studied cyanobacterial toxins, and thus included both microcystin-producing and non-producing strains. Extracts from 26 cyanobacterial cultures were initially screened in estrogen-, androgen-, and glucocorticoid-responsive reporter-gene assays (RGAs) in order to identify endocrine disruption at the level of nuclear receptor transcriptional activity. Extracts from selected strains were tested repeatedly in the estrogen-responsive RGAs, but the observed estrogen agonist and antagonist activity was minor and similar to that of the cyanobacteria growth medium control. We thus focused on another, non-receptor mediated mechanism of action, and studied the 17β-estradiol (natural estrogen hormone) biotransformation in human liver microsomes in the presence or absence of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), or an extract from the MC-LR producing M. aeruginosa PCC7806 strain. Our results show a modulating effect on the estradiol biotransformation. Thus, while 2-hydroxylation was significantly decreased following co-incubation of 17β-estradiol with MC-LR or M. aeruginosa PCC7806 extract, the relative concentration of estrone was increased.",PMC7232361

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of ubiquitous contaminants that perturb endocrine signaling and have been associated with altered immune function in children. In this study, we examined the effects of developmental exposure to PCBs on neuroimmune responses to an inflammatory challenge during adolescence. Sprague Dawley rat dams were exposed to a PCB mixture (Aroclor 1242, 1248, 1254, 1:1:1, 20 μg/kg/day) or oil control throughout pregnancy, and adolescent male and female offspring were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 μg/kg, ip) or saline control prior to euthanasia. Gene expression profiling was conducted in the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and midbrain. In the hypothalamus, PCBs increased expression of genes involved in neuroimmune function, including those within the nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB) complex, independent of LPS challenge. PCB exposure also increased expression of receptors for dopamine, serotonin, and estrogen in this region. In contrast, in the prefrontal cortex, PCB exposure blunted or induced irregular neuroimmune gene expression responses to LPS challenge. Moreover, neither PCB nor LPS exposure altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors throughout the mesocorticolimbic circuit. Almost all effects were present in males but not females, in agreement with the idea that male neuroimmune cells are more sensitive to perturbation and emphasizing the importance of studying both male and female subjects. Given that altered neuroimmune signaling has been implicated in mental health and substance abuse disorders that often begin during adolescence, these results highlight neuroimmune processes as another mechanism by which early life PCBs can alter brain function later in life.",PMC7340239

To determine whether women who intended to become pregnant had lower phthalate metabolite concentrations than those who had an unintended pregnancy, or whether change in phthalate exposure across pregnancy differed between these two groups. A total of 721 women enrolled in The Infant Development and Environment Study (TIDES), a multicentre US prospective pregnancy cohort; 513 (71%) indicated their pregnancy was planned. Urine samples from first- and third-trimester visits were analysed for 10 specific-gravity-adjusted, natural-log-transformed phthalate metabolites. Simple and multivariable linear regression, adjusting for centre, race, age, income, marital status, and parity, were employed to determine whether phthalate metabolite concentrations differed by pregnancy intention. In bivariate analyses, the geometric mean concentrations of all first-trimester and most third-trimester phthalates were higher in women with unplanned pregnancies. However, after covariate adjustment, only first-trimester monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP) remained associated with pregnancy intention, and the association changed direction such that unplanned pregnancies had lower MiBP concentrations (ß -0.18, 95% CI -0.35, -0.02).

Studies have shown that TBT targets the reproductive tract, impairing ovarian folliculogenesis, and uterine morphophysiology. In this investigation, we assessed whether subchronic and low dose of TBT exposure results in abnormal ovarian follicular reserve and other irregularities in female mice. TBT was administered to female mice (500 ng/kg/day for 12 days via gavage), and reproductive tract morphophysiology was assessed. We further assessed reproductive tract inflammation and oxidative stress. Improper functioning of the reproductive tract in TBT mice was observed. Specifically, irregular estrous cyclicity and abnormal ovarian morphology coupled with reduction in primordial and primary follicle numbers was observed, suggesting ovarian reserve depletion. In addition, improper follicular development and a reduction in antral follicles, corpora lutea, and total healthy ovarian follicles together with an increase in cystic follicles were apparent. Evidence of uterine atrophy, reduction in endometrial gland number, and inflammation and oxidative stress were seen in TBT mice. Further, strong negative correlations were observed between testosterone levels and primordial, primary, and total healthy ovarian follicles. Thus, these data suggest that the subchronic and low dose of TBT exposure impaired ovarian follicular reserve, uterine gland number, and other reproductive features in female mice.",PMC7357172

Interestingly, the impacted future generations display a wide range of heterogeneity in their reproductive traits. In this study, the role that the Y chromosome plays in creating such heterogeneity is explored by testing the hypothesis that the Y chromosome serves as a carrier of the exposure impact to future generations. This hypothesis implies that a male who has a Y chromosome that is from a male that was exposed to an endocrine disruptor will display a more severe reproductive phenotype than a male whose Y chromosome is from an unexposed male. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model in which F1 generation animals were exposed prenatally to an endocrine disruptor, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and the severity of impacted reproductive traits was compared between the F3 generation males that were descendants of F1 males (paternal lineage) and those from F1 females (maternal lineage). Pregnant dams (F0 generation) were exposed to the vehicle or 20 or 200 μg/kg/day of DEHP from gestation day 11 until birth. Paternal lineage F3 DEHP males exhibited decreased fertility, testicular steroidogenic capacity, and spermatogenesis that were more severely impaired than those of maternal lineage males. Indeed, testicular transcriptome analysis found that a number of Y chromosomal genes had altered expression patterns in the paternal lineage males. This transgenerational difference in the DEHP impact can be attributed specifically to the Y chromosome.",PMC7109079

We examined associations of exposure to common endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy with weight from delivery through 1 year postpartum among 199 women in Mexico City. Materials and Methods: During each trimester of pregnancy, we collected a urine sample to assay bisphenol A (BPA), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP), and monoethyl phthalate (MEP). We calculated summary scores for di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP) and dibutyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDBP). We calculated the geometric mean of each EDC across pregnancy for use in the analysis. At delivery and three additional times during the first year postpartum, we measured the women's weight. We used mixed-effects linear regression models to estimate associations of each EDC with weight at delivery (kg) and weight change (kg/year) from delivery through 1 year postpartum. Covariates included urinary specific gravity, maternal age, parity, height, first trimester body mass index, and gestational age at enrollment. Results: Mean ± standard deviation weight change during the first postpartum year was -0.49 ± 4.04 kg. The EDCs were inversely associated with weight at delivery, but positively associated with weight change through 1 year postpartum. For example, each interquartile range of urinary ΣDEHP corresponded with 1.38 (95% confidence interval: 0.44-2.33) kg lower weight at delivery and 1.01 (0.41--1.61) kg/year slower rate of weight loss.

Results: Health education by a prenatal professional with communication skills should take place as early as possible, during the preconception period or early pregnancy, as part of individual consultation or group workshops. In order to customize the discourse and to develop women's empowerment, concomitant presentation of the risks by the products used in each room and of previous solutions is recommended.

Because of the wide production and use of DEHP, humans are exposed to DEHP on a daily basis. Diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) is often used as a DEHP replacement chemical, and because of the increased use of DiNP, humans are increasingly exposed to DiNP over time. Of concern is that DEHP and DiNP both exhibit endocrine disrupting capabilities, and little is known about how short-term exposure to either of these phthalates affects aspects of female reproduction. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that short-term exposure to DEHP or DiNP during adulthood has long-lasting consequences on ovarian follicles and hormones in female mice. Female CD-1 mice aged 39-40 days were orally dosed with either vehicle control (corn oil), DEHP (20 μg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day), or DiNP (20 μg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day) for 10 days.

One possible approach to tackle MRA could be to cluster DNT chemicals in a mixture on the basis of their mode of action (MoA) into 'similar' and 'dissimilar', but still contributing to the same adverse outcome, and anchor DNT assays to common key events (CKEs) identified in DNT-specific adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Moreover, the use of human in vitro models, such as induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal and glial cultures would enable mechanistic understanding of chemically-induced adverse effects, avoiding species extrapolation. HiPSC-derived neural progenitors differentiated into mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes were used to assess the effects of acute (3 days) and repeated dose (14 days) treatments with single chemicals and in mixtures belonging to different classes (i.e., lead(II) chloride and methylmercury chloride (heavy metals), chlorpyrifos (pesticide), bisphenol A (organic compound and endocrine disrupter), valproic acid (drug), and PCB138 (persistent organic pollutant and endocrine disrupter), which are associated with cognitive deficits, including learning and memory impairment in children. Selected chemicals were grouped based on their mode of action (MoA) into 'similar' and 'dissimilar' MoA compounds and their effects on synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels, identified as CKEs in currently available AOPs relevant to DNT, were evaluated by immunocytochemistry and high content imaging analysis. Chemicals working through similar MoA (i.e., alterations of BDNF levels), at non-cytotoxic (IC20/100), very low toxic (IC5), or moderately toxic (IC20) concentrations, induce DNT effects in mixtures, as shown by increased number of neurons, impairment of neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis (the most sensitive endpoint as confirmed by mathematical modelling) and increase of BDNF levels, to a certain extent reproducing autism-like cellular changes observed in the brain of autistic children. Our findings suggest that the use of human iPSC-derived mixed neuronal/glial cultures applied to a battery of assays anchored to key events of an AOP network represents a valuable approach to identify mixtures of chemicals with potential to cause learning and memory impairment in children.",PMC7038628

We enrolled 2,001 women>18 years of age during the first trimester of pregnancy between 2008 and 2011 from 10 cities in Canada. At 3-4 years of age, 610 children underwent neuropsychological assessments including the Social Responsiveness Scale-II (SRS-2) as a measure of autistic traits and social impairment. We measured 11 phthalate metabolites in maternal first trimester urine samples and assessed folic acid supplementation from reported intakes. We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in SRS-2 T-scores with a doubling in phthalate concentrations in 510 children with complete data. Mean total SRS T-score was 45.3 (SD=6.1). Children with higher gestational exposure to mono-n-butyl (MBP) and mono-3-carboxypropyl (MCPP) concentrations exhibited significantly higher total SRS T-scores, indicating greater overall social impairment, as well as higher scores on subdomains, indicating deficits in social cognition, social communication, social motivation, and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors.

Six models of association between mycoestrogens urinary levels (zearalenone, total zearalenone and alternariol) and food items (meat, cheese, and fresh-cheese, breakfast cereals, sweets) were established. Applying the obtained models to the consumption data (n = 5811) of the general population, the median estimates of the probable daily intake revealed that a fraction of the Portuguese population might exceed the tolerable daily intake defined for zearalenone.

Thus, chemicals that can affect thyroid hormone signaling during pregnancy are of great concern. Perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) is a widespread environmental contaminant found in human serum, breastmilk, and other tissues, capable of lowering serum thyroxine (T4) in rats. Here, we investigated its effects on the thyroid system and neurodevelopment following maternal exposure from early gestation through lactation (0.05, 5 or 25 mg/kg/day PFHxS), alone or in combination with a mixture of 12 environmentally relevant endocrine disrupting compounds (EDmix). PFHxS lowered thyroid hormone levels in both dams and offspring in a dose-dependent manner, but did not change TSH levels, weight, histology, or expression of marker genes of the thyroid gland. No evidence of thyroid hormone-mediated neurobehavioral disruption in offspring was observed. Since human brain development appear very sensitive to low T4 levels, we maintain that PFHxS is of potential concern to human health. It is our view that current rodent models are not sufficiently sensitive to detect adverse neurodevelopmental effects of maternal and perinatal hypothyroxinemia and that we need to develop more sensitive brain-based markers or measurable metrics of thyroid hormone-dependent perturbations in brain development.",PMC7021709

BPA, an endocrine disruptor, leads to alterations in reproductive function and therefore has been banned from the food industry. Unregulated BPA analogues, particularly Bisphenol S (BPS), have emerged and are now used in the plastic industry. Thus, this study aimed to examine the acute effects of low and environmental doses of BPS on ewe oocyte quality and developmental competence, and its mechanism of action, during in vitro maturation. Ewe cumulus-oocyte complexes underwent in vitro maturation in the presence or absence of BPS (1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 µM or 10 µM). Oocytes were then subjected to in vitro fertilisation and development. 1 µM BPS induced a 12.7% decrease in the cleavage rate (p = 0.004) and a 42.6% decrease in the blastocyst rate (p = 0.017) compared to control. The blastocyst rate reduction was also observed with 10 nM BPS. Furthermore, 10 µM BPS reduced the oocyte maturation rate, and 1 µM BPS decreased cumulus cell progesterone secretion. PR and AMH gene expression were reduced in cumulus cells. BPS induced a 5-fold increase in MAPK 3/1 activation (p = 0.04). BPS impaired ewe oocyte developmental competence.

We used high throughput in vitro bioactivity data and exposure predictions from the U.S. EPA's Toxicity and Exposure Forecaster (ToxCast and ExpoCast) to estimate combined estrogen receptor (ER) agonist activity of non-pharmaceutical chemical exposures for the general U.S. population. High-throughput toxicokinetic (HTTK) data provide conversion factors that relate bioactive concentrations measured in vitro (µM), to predicted population geometric mean exposure rates (mg/kg/day). These data were available for 22 chemicals with ER agonist activity and were estimated for other ER bioactive chemicals based on the geometric mean of HTTK values across chemicals. For each chemical, ER bioactivity across ToxCast assays was compared to predicted population geometric mean exposure at different levels of in vitro potency and model certainty. Dose additivity was assumed in calculating a Combined Exposure-Bioactivity Index (CEBI), the sum of exposure/bioactivity ratios. Combined estrogen bioactivity was also calculated in terms of the percent maximum bioactivity of chemical mixtures in human plasma using a concentration-addition model. Estimated CEBIs vary greatly depending on assumptions used for exposure and bioactivity. In general, CEBI values were <1 when using median of the estimated general population chemical intake rates, while CEBI were ≥1 when using the upper 95th confidence bound for those same intake rates for all chemicals. Concentration-addition model predictions of mixture bioactivity yield comparable results. Based on current in vitro bioactivity data, HTTK methods, and exposure models, combined exposure scenarios sufficient to influence estrogen bioactivity in the general population cannot be ruled out. Future improvements in screening methods and computational models could reduce uncertainty and better inform the potential combined effects of estrogenic chemicals.",PMC7717552

Its main action is the conversion of androgens into estrogens, transforming androstenedione into estrone and testosterone into estradiol. This enzyme is present in several tissues and it has a key role in the maintenance of the balance of androgens and estrogens, and therefore in the regulation of the endocrine system. With regard to chemical safety and human health, azoles, which are used as agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, are potential endocrine disruptors due to their agonist or antagonist interactions with the human aromatase enzyme. This theoretical study investigated the active agonist and antagonist properties of ""chemical classes of azoles"" to determine the relationships of azole interaction with CYP19A1, using stereochemical and electronic properties of the molecules through classification and multilinear regression (MLR) modeling. The antagonist activities for the same substituent on diazoles and triazoles vary with its chemical composition and its position and both heterocyclic systems require aromatic substituents. The triazoles require the spherical shape and diazoles have to be in proper proportion of the branching index and the number of ring systems for the inhibition. Considering the electronic aspects, triazole antagonist activity depends on the electrophilicity index that originates from interelectronic exchange interaction (ωHF) and the LUMO energy ( E LUMO PM 7 ), and the diazole antagonist activity originates from the penultimate orbital ( E HOMONL PM 7 ) of diazoles. The regression models for agonist activity show that it is opposed by the static charges but favored by the delocalized charges on the diazoles and thiazoles. This study proposes that the electron penetration of azoles toward heme group decides the binding behavior and stereochemistry requirement for antagonist activity against CYP19A1 enzyme.",PMC7037385

However, there is a paucity of literature regarding the effects of paraben exposures on gestational weight gain (GWG), a considerable predictor of obesity risk in both mothers and offspring later in life. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the associations between urinary paraben concentrations and GWG during the three trimesters of pregnancy. We collected urine samples from 613 pregnant women during the first, second, and third trimesters of their pregnancies between 2014 and 2015 in Wuhan, China. The urine concentrations of five parabens, including methylparaben (MeP), ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben (PrP), butylparaben, and benzylparaben, were measured. Gestational weight in each trimester and prepregnancy weight were used to calculate trimester GWG. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the trimester-specific and overall associations between paraben exposures and GWG rate (trimester GWG divided by the gestational week of the weight measurement, kg/week). We performed stratified analysis to further explore the potential effect modification by prepregnancy BMI. In the trimester-specific association analyses, the first-trimester concentrations MeP, EtP, PrP, and ∑parabens (sum of all five parabens's molar concentrations) were associated with an increased first-trimester GWG rate, and these associations were stronger than those of the second or third trimesters. The overall association analysis showed that increased trimester GWG rates were associated with the combined effects of exposure to MeP, PrP, or ∑parabens during all three trimesters. Stratified analysis showed that higher paraben exposures were associated with higher trimester GWG rates among overweight/obese women that among normal-weight or underweight women.

How these contaminants work together at levels found in humans and how displacement from TTR in vitro relates to in vivo T4-TTR binding is unknown. Our aims were to determine the TTR-binding potency for contaminant mixtures as found in house dust, maternal serum, and infant serum; to study whether the TTR-binding potency of the mixtures follows the principle of concentration addition; and to extrapolate the in vitro TTR-binding potency to in vivo inhibition levels of T4-TTR binding in maternal and infant serum. Twenty-five contaminants were tested for their in vitro capacity to compete for TTR-binding with a fluorescent FITC-T4 probe. Three mixtures were reconstituted proportionally to median concentrations for these chemicals in house dust, maternal serum, or infant serum from Nordic countries. Measured concentration-response curves were compared with concentration-response curves predicted by concentration addition. For each reconstituted serum mixture, its inhibitor-TTR dissociation constant (Ki) was used to estimate inhibition levels of T4-TTR binding in human blood. The TTR-binding potency of the mixtures was well predicted by concentration addition. The ∼20% inhibition in FITC-T4 binding observed for the mixtures reflecting median concentrations in maternal and infant serum was extrapolated to 1.3% inhibition of T4-TTR binding in maternal and 1.5% in infant blood. For nontested mixtures reflecting high-end serum concentrations, these estimates were 6.2% and 4.9%, respectively. The relatively low estimated inhibition levels at median exposure levels may explain why no relationship between exposure to TTR-binding compounds and circulating T4 levels in humans has been reported, so far. We hypothesize, however, that 1.3% inhibition of T4-TTR binding may ultimately be decisive for reaching a status of maternal hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia associated with impaired neurodevelopment in children. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5911.",PMC7015555

In this birth cohort, we observed associations between maternal gestational exposure to select EDC biomarkers and telomere length, most of which were sex-specific. These findings need to be confirmed in future studies.",PMC8667573

For this reason, the development of cheap, simple but very effective techniques for the removal of such residues from wastewater is very important. In this study, the analysis of the potential of using three new plants: Cyperus papyrus (Papyrus), Lysimachia nemorum (Yellow pimpernel), and Euonymus europaeus (European spindle) by hydroponic cultivation for the removal of 15 selected pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in an MWWTP is presented. In order to obtain the most reliable data, this study was performed using real WWTP conditions and with the determination of the selected analytes in untreated sewage, treated sewage, and in plant materials. For determining the target compounds in plant materials, an Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE)-Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE)-GC-MS(SIM) method was developed and validated. The obtained data proved that the elimination efficiency of the investigated substances from wastewater was in the range of 35.8% for diflunisal to above 99.9% for paracetamol, terbutaline, and flurbiprofen. Lysimachia nemorum was the most effective for the uptake of target compounds among the tested plant species. Thus, the application of constructed wetlands for supporting conventional MWWTPs allowed a significant increase in their removal from the wastewater stream.",PMC6982867

However, little is known about late-life consequences due to DEHP or DiNP exposure during adulthood. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that adult exposure to DEHP or DiNP affects female reproductive parameters during late-life in female mice. Female CD-1 mice (age 39-40 days) were dosed with either vehicle control, DEHP (20 μg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day), or DiNP (20 μg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day) for 10 days and breeding trials were conducted at 12 and 15 months post-dosing. Further, ovaries and sera were collected at 12, 15, and 18 months post-dosing. DEHP and DiNP disrupted estrous cyclicity, increased pregnancy loss, decreased fertility, altered the sex ratio of pups, altered ovarian follicle populations, and disrupted hormone levels. Collectively, these data show that short-term exposure to DEHP or DiNP during adulthood has long-term consequences in late-life.",PMC7138709

Traditional phthalic acid ester plasticizers (PAEs), such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are now increasingly being replaced with more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC). While the metabolic pathways for PAE degradation have been established in the terrestrial environment, to our knowledge, the mechanisms for ATBC biodegradation have not been identified previously and plasticizer degradation in the marine environment remains underexplored. From marine plastic debris, we enriched and isolated microbes able to grow using a range of plasticizers and, for the first time, identified the pathways used by two phylogenetically distinct bacteria to degrade three different plasticizers (i.e., DBP, DEHP, and ATBC) via a comprehensive proteogenomic and metabolomic approach. This integrated multi-OMIC study also revealed the different mechanisms used for ester side-chain removal from the different plasticizers (esterases and enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway) as well as the molecular response to deal with toxic intermediates, that is, phthalate, and the lower biodegrading potential detected for ATBC than for PAE plasticizers. This study highlights the metabolic potential that exists in the biofilms that colonize plastics-the Plastisphere-to effectively biodegrade plastic additives and flags the inherent importance of microbes in reducing plastic toxicity in the environment.",PMC7031849

The core goal of this article is to propose new evidence based investigative post-mortem guidelines that should be adopted in all the Institutions especially when a fetal death, after a routine autopsy procedure, is diagnosed as ""unexplained"". The proposed protocol is mainly focused on the anatomopathological examination of the autonomic nervous system and in particular of the brainstem where the main centers that control vital functions are located. Updated investigative guidelines for the examination of unexplained stillbirths, prevalently focused on the histological examination of the brainstem, where the main centers that are involved in monitoring the vital functions are located, are here presented. A section of this protocol concerns the Immunohistochemical evaluation of specific functional markers such as the neuronal nuclear antigen, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin, orexin, apoptosis and gliosis. The important role of risk factors, having regard in particular to maternal smoking and air pollution is also contemplated in these guidelines. Specific morphological and/or functional alterations of vital brainstem structures have been found with high incidence in over 100 cases of unexplained fetal death sent to the ""Lino Rossi Research Center"" of the Milan University according to the Italian law. These alterations were rarely detected in a group of control cases. We hope this protocol can be adopted in all the Institutions notably for the examination of unexplained fetal deaths, in order to make uniform investigations. This will lead to identify a plausible explanation of the pathogenetic mechanism behind the unexplained fetal deaths and to design preventive strategies to decrease the incidence of these very distressing events for both parents and clinicians. not applicable for this study.",PMC6936151

Here, we show in Caenorhabditis elegans that supplementation with the antioxidant Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) rescues the reprotoxicity induced by the widely used plasticizer and endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA), in part by neutralizing DNA damage resulting from oxidative stress. CoQ10 significantly reduces BPA-induced elevated levels of germ cell apoptosis, phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK-1), double-strand breaks (DSBs), and chromosome defects in diakinesis oocytes. BPA-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in the germline are counteracted by CoQ10. Finally, CoQ10 treatment also reduced the levels of aneuploid embryos and BPA-induced defects observed in early embryonic divisions. We propose that CoQ10 may counteract BPA-induced reprotoxicity through the scavenging of reactive oxygen species and free radicals, and that this natural antioxidant could constitute a low-risk and low-cost strategy to attenuate the impact on fertility by BPA.",PMC7017011

While a large number of toxicological studies have investigated the effects of BPA, the potential effects of BPA exposure on fish brain have rarely been studied. To understand how BPA impacts goldfish brains, we performed a transcriptome analysis of goldfish brains that had been exposed to 50 μg L-1 and 0 μg L-1 BPA for 30 days. In the analysis of unigene expression profiles, 327 unigenes were found to be upregulated and 153 unigenes were found to be downregulated in the BPA exposure group compared to the control group. Dopaminergic signaling pathway-related genes were significantly downregulated in the BPA exposure group. Furthermore, we found that serum dopamine concentrations decreased and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2-deoxyuridine, 5-triphosphate nick end labeling) staining was present in dopamine neurons enriched regions in the brain after BPA exposure, suggesting that BPA may disrupt dopaminergic processes. A KEGG analysis revealed that genes involved in the fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis pathway were highly significantly enriched. In addition, the qRT-PCR results for fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis pathway-related genes and the vascular histology of the brain showed that BPA exposure could damage blood vessels and induce brain atherosclerosis. The results of this work provide insights into the biological effects of BPA on dopamine synthesis and blood vessels in goldfish brain and could lay a foundation for future BPA neurotoxicity studies.",PMC6941070

The US EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) has identified several molecular thyroid targets relevant to hormone synthesis dynamics that have been adapted to high-throughput screening (HTS) assays to rapidly evaluate the ToxCast/Tox21 chemical inventories for potential thyroid disrupting chemicals (TDCs). The uncertainty surrounding the specificity of active chemicals identified in these screens and the relevance to phenotypic effects on in vivo human TH synthesis are notable data gaps for hazard identification of TDCs. The objective of this study was to develop a medium-throughput organotypic screening assay comprised of reconstructed human thyroid microtissues to quantitatively evaluate the disruptive effects of chemicals on TH production and secretion. Primary human thyroid cells procured from qualified euthyroid donors were analyzed for retention of NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1), Keratin 7 (KRT7), and Thyroglobulin (TG) protein expression by high-content image analysis to verify enrichment of follicular epithelial cells. A direct comparison of 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) 96-well culture formats was employed to characterize the morphology, differential gene expression, TG production, and TH synthesis over the course of 20 days. The results indicate that modeling human thyroid cells in the 3D format was sufficient to restore TH synthesis not observed in the 2D culture format. Inhibition of TH synthesis in an optimized 3D culture format was demonstrated with reference chemicals for key molecular targets within the thyroid gland.

Since this endocrine disruptor also displays genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects, it likely alters the spermatogenesis, a process in which both hormones and chromatin remodeling play crucial roles. The hypothesis of this work is that BPA impairs early embryo development by modifying the spermatic genetic and epigenetic information. Zebrafish males were exposed to 100 and 2000 μg/L BPA during early spermatogenesis and during the whole process. Genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects on spermatozoa (comet assay and immunocytochemistry) as well as progeny development (mortality, DNA repairing activity, apoptosis and epigenetic profile) were evaluated. Exposure to 100 µg/L BPA during mitosis slightly increased sperm chromatin fragmentation, enhancing DNA repairing activity in embryos. The rest of treatments promoted high levels of sperm DNA damage, triggering apoptosis in early embryo and severely impairing survival. Regarding epigenetics, histone acetylation (H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac) was similarly enhanced in spermatozoa and embryos from males exposed to all the treatments. Therefore, BPA male exposure jeopardizes embryonic survival and development due to the transmission of a paternal damaged genome and of a hyper-acetylated histone profile, both alterations depending on the dose of the toxicant and the temporal window of exposure.",PMC6889327

Therefore, it is important to find not only effective but also ecofriendly methods for their removal from aqueous environment since the traditional wastewater treatment approaches are ineffective. Herein, for the first time, such extended comparison of several radical-driven technologies for paraben mixture degradation is presented. The detailed evaluation included (1) comparison of ozone and hydroxyl peroxide processes; (2) comparison of catalytic and photocatalytic processes (including photocatalytic ozonation); (3) characterisation of catalysts using SEM, XRD, DRS, XPS techniques and BET isotherm; (4) mineralisation, biodegradability and toxicity assessment; and (5) cost assessment.

Research was focused on the photocatalytic process involving visible light (UVA and natural sunlight) and TiO2 catalysts modified by different metals (Ag, Pt, Pd, Au). Photocatalytic oxidation showed the lowest efficiency, while in combining ozone with catalysis and photocatalysis process, degradation efficiency and toxicity removal were improved. Photocatalytic ozonation slightly improved degradation efficiency but appreciably decreased transferred ozone dose (TOD).

While numerous studies have characterized the effects of EDCs on temperate fishes, less is known on the effects of EDCs on the growth and reproductive physiology of tropical species. To determine the long-term effects of early-life exposure to common estrogenic chemicals, we exposed Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) yolk-sac fry to 17β-estradiol (E2) and nonylphenol (NP) and subsequently characterized the expression of genes involved in growth and reproduction in adults. Fry were exposed to waterborne E2 (0.1 and 1 μg/L) and NP (10 and 100 μg/L) for 21 days. After the exposure period, juveniles were reared for an additional 112 days until males were sampled. Gonadosomatic index was elevated in fish exposed to E2 (0.1 μg/L) while hepatosomatic index was decreased by exposure to NP (100 μg/L). Exposure to E2 (0.1 μg/L) induced hepatic growth hormone receptor (ghr) mRNA expression. The high concentration of E2 (1 μg/L), and both concentrations of NP, increased hepatic insulin-like growth-factor 1 (igf1) expression; E2 and NP did not affect hepatic igf2 and pituitary growth hormone (gh) levels. Both E2 (1 μg/L) and NP (10 μg/L) induced hepatic igf binding protein 1b (igfbp1b) levels while only NP (100 μg/L) induced hepatic igfbp2b levels. By contrast, hepatic igfbp6b was reduced in fish exposed to E2 (1 μg/L). There were no effects of E2 or NP on hepatic igfbp4 and igfbp5a expression. Although the expression of three vitellogenin transcripts was not affected, E2 and NP stimulated hepatic estrogen receptor (erα and erβ) mRNA expression.

We and others have published evidence of developmental neurotoxicity and sex specific effects of FM 550 on anxiety-like and exploratory behaviors. Using a prosocial animal model, we investigated the impact of perinatal FM 550 exposure on a range of socioemotional behaviors including anxiety, attachment, and memory. Virtually unknown to toxicologists, but widely used in the behavioral neurosciences, the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is a uniquely valuable model organism for examining environmental factors on sociality because this species is spontaneously prosocial, biparental, and displays attachment behaviors including pair bonding. Dams were exposed to 0, 500, 1000, or 2000 μg of FM 550 via subcutaneous (sc) injections throughout gestation, and pups were directly exposed beginning the day after birth until weaning. Adult offspring of both sexes were then subjected to multiple tasks including open field, novel object recognition, and partner preference. Effects were dose responsive and sex-specific, with females more greatly affected. Exposure-related outcomes in females included elevated anxiety, decreased social interaction, decreased exploratory motivation, and aversion to novelty. Exposed males also had social deficits, with males in all three dose groups failing to show a partner preference. Our studies demonstrate the utility of the prairie vole for investigating the impact of chemical exposures on social behavior and support the hypothesis that developmental FR exposure impacts the social brain. Future studies will probe the possible mechanisms by which these effects arise.",PMC7214199

Known steroidal estrogens were quantified and changes in signaling pathway molecular initiating events (activation of estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, peroxisome proliferator-activated, pregnane X receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling networks) were identified in water extracts. In initial multi-endpoint assays geographic and receptor-specific endocrine activity patterns in transcription factor signatures and nuclear receptor activation were discovered. In subsequent single endpoint receptor-specific bioassays, estrogen (16 of 18 samples; 0.01 to 28 ng estradiol equivalents [E2Eqs]/L) glucocorticoid (3 of 18 samples; 1.8 to 21 ng dexamethasone equivalents [DexEqs]/L), and androgen (2 of 18 samples; 0.95 to 2.1 ng dihydrotestosterone equivalents [DHTEqs]/L) receptor transcriptional activation occurred above respective assay method detection limits (0.04 ng E2Eqs/L, 1.2 ng DexEqs/L, and 0.77 ng DHTEqs/L) in multiple sampling events. Estrogen activity, the most often detected, correlated well with measured concentrations of known steroidal estrogens (r2 = 0.890). Overall, activity indicative of multiple types of endocrine active compounds was highest in wastewater effluent samples, while activity downstream was progressively lower, and negligible in unfinished treated drinking water. Not only was estrogenic and glucocorticoid activity confirmed in the effluent by utilizing multiple methods concurrently, but other activated signaling networks that historically received less attention (i.e. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) were also detected.",PMC9136853

This work extends previous analysis of the HT-H295R dataset and model by examining the utility of a novel prioritization metric based on the Mahalanobis distance that reduced these 11-dimensional data to 1-dimension via calculation of a mean Mahalanobis distance (mMd) at each chemical concentration screened for all hormone measures available. Herein, we evaluated the robustness of mMd values, and demonstrate that covariance and variance of the hormones measured appear independent of the chemicals screened and are inherent to the assay; the Type I error rate of the mMd method is less than 1%; and, absolute fold changes (up or down) of 1.5 to 2-fold have sufficient power for statistical significance. As a case study, we examined hormone responses for aromatase inhibitors in the HT-H295R assay and found high concordance with other ToxCast assays for known aromatase inhibitors.

Among them, bisphenol A (BPA) has been previously analyzed as potential modifier of puberty. Yet, disparate results have been reported, with BPA advancing, delaying, or being neutral in its effects on puberty onset. Likewise, mechanistic analyses addressing the central and peripheral actions/targets of BPA at puberty remain incomplete and conflictive. We aimed to provide a comprehensive characterization of the impact of early BPA exposures, especially at low, real-life doses, on the postnatal development of hypothalamic Kiss1/NKB neurons, and its functional consequences on female pubertal maturation. Pregnant CD1 female mice were orally administered BPA at 5, 10, or 40μg/kg body weight (BW)/d from gestational day 11 to postnatal day 8 (PND8). Vaginal opening, as an external marker of puberty onset, was monitored daily from PND19 to PND30 in the female offspring. Blood and brain samples were collected at PND12, 15, 18, 21, and 30 for measuring circulating levels of gonadotropins and analyzing the hypothalamic expression of Kiss1/kisspeptin and NKB. Perinatal exposure to BPA, in a range of doses largely below the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL; 5mg/kg BW/d, according to the FDA), was associated with pubertal differences in the female progeny compared with those exposed to vehicle alone, with an earlier age of vaginal opening but consistently lower levels of circulating luteinizing hormone. Mice treated with BPA exhibited a persistent, but divergent, impairment of Kiss1 neuronal maturation, with more kisspeptin cells in the rostral (RP3V) hypothalamus but consistently fewer kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Detailed quantitative analysis of the ARC population, essential for pubertal development, revealed that mice treated with BPA had persistently lower Kiss1 expression during (pre)pubertal maturation, which was associated with lower Tac2 (encoding NKB) levels, even at low doses (5μg/kg BW/d), in the range of the tolerable daily intake (TDI), recently updated by the European Food Safety Authority. Our data attest to the consistent, but divergent, effects of gestational exposures to low concentrations of BPA, via the oral route, on phenotypic and neuroendocrine markers of puberty in female mice, with an unambiguous impact on the developmental maturation not only of Kiss1, but also of the NKB system, both essential regulators of puberty onset. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5570.",PMC6867420

In particular, the hormone balance during gestation is delicate, and disturbance may cause acute or chronic long-term health effects. A potential endocrine disruption may be provoked by in utero exposure to xenoestrogens mimicking endogenous estrogens. The mycoestrogen zearalenone (ZEN), a toxic fungal secondary metabolite and mycotoxin found frequently in food and feed, constitutes a prominent example. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the transfer as well as phase I and phase II metabolism of ZEN at the human placental barrier. Human placentas were perfused with 1μM (318μg/L) ZEN for 6 h. Samples from the maternal and fetal compartment, placental tissue, and fetal plasma were analyzed by a highly sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS assay to detect ZEN as well as nine key metabolites (α-zearalenol, β-zearalenol, zearalanone, α-zearalanol, β-zearalanol, ZEN-14-glucuronide, α-zearalenol-14-glucuronide, β-zearalenol-14-glucuronide, ZEN-14-sulfate). The model revealed a fast maternofetal transfer of ZEN across the human placental barrier. We also unraveled phase I and phase II metabolism of the parent toxin ZEN into the approximately 70-times more estrogenic α-zearalenol and the less active ZEN-14-sulfate conjugate, which are effectively released into the maternal and fetal circulation in considerable amounts. Our findings suggest that exposure to ZEN (such as through consumption of ZEN-contaminated cereal-based products) during pregnancy may result in in utero exposure of the fetus, not only to ZEN but also some of its highly estrogenically active metabolites. In the light of the known affinity of ZEN and potentially co-occurring xenoestrogens to the estrogen receptor, and our results demonstrating placental transfer of ZEN and its metabolites in an ex vivo model, we recommend further research and more comprehensive assessment of gestational exposures in women. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4860.",PMC6867367

First, a method for extraction and fractionation of a broad range of polar and nonpolar EDCs was developed and validated. Maximal recoveries of reference compounds and minimal interference from the matrix were achieved with a combination of solid phase extraction and dispersive liquid/liquid extraction. Bioassay analysis using cell-based reporter gene assays revealed estrogenic, androgenic, and dioxin-like activity in AF extract corresponding to 1.4 nmol EEQ/L, 76.6 pmol DHT-EQ/L, and 10.1 pmol TEQ/L, respectively.

Bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), which have been substituted for BPA in some consumer products, have also shown endocrine-disrupting effects in experimental models. However, the effects of BPF and BPS on fetal growth in humans are unknown. Our goal was to investigate trimester-specific associations of urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS with size at birth. The present study included 845 pregnant women from Wuhan, China (2013-2015), who provided one urine sample in each of the first, second, and third trimesters. Linear regressions with generalized estimating equations were applied to estimate trimester-specific associations of urinary bisphenol concentrations with birth weight, birth length, and ponderal index. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify potential critical windows of susceptibility to bisphenols by comparing the exposure patterns of newborns in the 10th percentile of each birth anthropometric measurement to that of those in the 90th percentile. Medians (25th-75th percentiles) of urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS were 1.40 (0.19-3.85), 0.65 (0.34-1.39), and 0.38 (0.13-1.11) ng/mL, respectively. Urinary BPA concentrations in different trimesters were inversely, but not significantly, associated with birth weight and ponderal index. Urinary concentrations of BPF and BPS during some trimesters were associated with significantly lower birth weight, birth length, or ponderal index, with significant trend p-values (ptrend<0.05) across quartiles of BPF and BPS concentrations. The observed associations were unchanged after additionally adjusting for other bisphenols. In addition, newborns in the 10th percentile of each birth anthropometry measure had higher BPF and BPS exposures during pregnancy than newborns in the 90th percentile of each outcome.

We randomly selected 50 healthy pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies from a pregnancy cohort who had available serum/urine samples in each trimester for measuring 144 persistent and 48 nonpersistent EDCs. We used unsupervised machine-learning techniques capable of handling hierarchical clustering of exposures to identify EDC patterns across pregnancy, and linear mixed-effects modeling with false-discovery rate correction to identify those that change over pregnancy trimesters. We estimated the percent variation in chemical concentrations accounted for by time (pregnancy trimester) using Akaike Information Criterion-based R methods. Four chemical clusters comprising 80 compounds, of which six consistently increased, 63 consistently decreased, and 11 reflected inconsistent patterns over pregnancy. Overall, concentrations tended to decrease over pregnancy for persistent EDCs; a reverse pattern was seen for many nonpersistent chemicals.

However, despite the role that the skeletal muscle plays in glucose homeostasis, it remains unknown whether gestational exposure to BPA, or its analog bisphenol S (BPS), impairs skeletal muscle development. We hypothesized that gestational exposure to BPA or BPS will impair fetal muscle development and lead to muscle-specific insulin resistance. To test this, pregnant sheep (n = 7-8/group) were exposed to BPA or BPS from gestational day (GD) 30 to 100. At GD120, fetal skeletal muscle was harvested to evaluate fiber size, fiber type, and gene and protein expression related to myogenesis, fiber size, fiber type, and inflammation. Fetal primary myoblasts were isolated to evaluate proliferation and differentiation. In fetal skeletal muscle, myofibers were larger in BPA and BPS groups in both females and males. BPA females had higher MYH1 (reflective of type-IIX fast glycolytic fibers), whereas BPS females had higher MYH2 and MYH7, and higher myogenic regulatory factors (Myf5, MyoG, MyoD, and MRF4) mRNA expression. No differences were observed in males. Myoblast proliferation was not altered in gestationally BPA- or BPS-exposed myoblasts, but upon differentiation, area and diameter of myotubes were larger independent of sex. Females had larger myofibers and myotubes than males in all treatment groups.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most commonly environmental EDCs. As the nitric oxide (NO) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathways both contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension, we evaluated whether resveratrol, an antioxidant and an AHR antagonist, can prevent hypertension programmed by a maternal BPA and HF diet. Sixteen-week-old male rat offspring were assigned to six groups (n = 8 per group): Control, HF (D12331, Research Diets), BPA (50 μg/kg/day), HF + BPA, BPA + R (resveratrol 50mg/L in drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation), and HF + BPA + R. Maternal BPA exposure exacerbated hypertension programmed by HF consumption in adult male offspring, which was protected by maternal resveratrol therapy. The BPA and HF diet synergistically induced oxidative stress in offspring kidneys, which resveratrol treatment prevented. We observed that HF + BPA-induced programmed hypertension was associated with a decreased NO bioavailability, increased oxidative stress, and an activated AHR signaling pathway. The beneficial effects of resveratrol are relevant to restoring NO bioavailability, reducing oxidative stress, and antagonizing the AHR signaling pathway. Our results cast a new light on resveratrol as a reprogramming strategy to protect against hypertension programmed by combined BPA and HF exposure, but this strategy has yet to be translated into clinical applications.",PMC6770559

Pre-implantation and post-implantation urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA concentrations were measured in pooled urine samples designed to limit single-measure variability due to the likely episodic nature of these exposures and the short half-life of these compounds. We estimated associations between these exposure biomarkers early in pregnancy with length of gestation from implantation to spontaneous birth. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard of birth among 125 naturally-conceived, singleton live births with censoring for medical interventions that artificially shortened pregnancy. Higher concentrations of mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (a metabolite of di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)) during the pre-implantation window were associated with reduced probability of birth, i.e., longer gestations (hazard ratio (HR): 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.86; p = 0.01).

In comparison, small RNAs were minimally affected by DBP exposure. While initial study medication (high or background) implicates different biological pathways, initiation on the high-DBP condition activated oxidative stress and DNA damage pathways.

In utero development and adolescence are critical windows of susceptibility to EDC exposure. With the exception of a few heavy metals, few human studies have evaluated the impact of metal exposure on pubertal development. Our aim was to investigate measures of in utero and peripubertal metal exposure in relation to reproductive hormone levels and sexual maturation and progression among girls from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohorts. We measured urinary concentrations of aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), antimony (Sb), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) in samples collected from women during their third trimester of pregnancy and from their female children at 8-13 years (n = 132). We measured serum testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), inhibin B, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) at age 8-13, and assessed Tanner stages for sexual maturation (breast, pubic hair development, and menarche status), at two time points (8-13, 14-18 years). We used linear regression to independently examine in utero and peripubertal metal concentrations as predictors of peripubertal hormones. In a longitudinal analysis using generalized estimation equations, we evaluated Tanner stage and menarche progression in relation to individual in utero and peripubertal metal concentrations. We found that higher in utero Zn was associated with increased inhibin B. Several metals at 8-13 years were associated with higher DHEA-S and estradiol, while Ni was positively but Cu was negatively associated with testosterone. In utero Ni, Al, and Cd were associated with slower progression of breast development after adjustment for child age and BMI z-score. For example, an IQR increase in in utero Al exposure was associated with 0.82 times lower odds of progressing to a higher Tanner stage for breast development per year (95% CI: 0.68, 0.99). Peripubertal concentrations of Ba and Al were also associated with being at a higher pubic hair Tanner stage and menarche at 8-13, but lower odds of progressing to the next stage at 14-18 years. We used Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to model the joint effect of multiple metals while accounting for correlated exposures, as well as potential non-linear relationships between metals and outcomes of interest, which yielded results similar to individual analyses. These findings suggest that female reproductive development may be vulnerable to the effects of metal exposure, and using both Tanner stages and hormone levels may provide clues about underlying mechanisms in two sensitive periods of development.",PMC6734930

EDCs have been linked to pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes (GDM), and PCP use could represent a modifiable source of exposure in this sensitive time window. Yet, to our knowledge, no study has directly evaluated the association between pregnancy use of PCP and late pregnancy glucose levels, established risk factors for complications such as GDM. A total of 233 women from the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study had data available on 1st and/or 2nd trimester PCP use, assessed through self-reported use over the previous 24 h, and blood glucose levels after the glucose loading test (GLT), taken at late 2nd trimester. Associations between each individual PCP and total PCP with glucose levels were evaluated in multivariable adjusted linear regression models. Both positive and negative differences in glucose levels were observed when comparing users vs. non-users of several PCPs including 2nd trimester use of deodorant (adjusted mean difference: 12.2 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.6, 24.9); bar soap (6.9 mg/dL, 95% CI: -0.9, 14.7 mg/dL); and liquid soap (-13.3, 95% CI: -26.8, 0.1 mg/dL), and 1st trimester use of sunscreen (-14.6 mg/dL, 95% CI: -27.8, -1.5 mg/dL). Total number of PCPs used in the 2nd trimester was also associated with higher glucose levels, with the largest difference of 20 mg/dL when comparing individuals who used eight vs none PCPs (95% CI: 3-37). In a pregnancy cohort of women seeking care at a fertility clinic, we found the use of several PCPs to be positively or negatively associated with glucose levels in the late second trimester, which may reflect increased risk of GDM and subsequent perinatal outcomes. These results strengthen the role of product use as a potentially modifiable source of EDCs that may impact glucose levels.",PMC6868339

This integration is achieved through logical rules that describe the association between genes, proteins, and reactions (GPRs). However, current gene-to-reaction formulation lacks the stoichiometry describing the transcript copies necessary to generate an active catalytic unit, which limits our understanding of how genes modulate metabolism. The present work introduces a new state-of-the-art GPR formulation that considers the stoichiometry of the transcripts (S-GPR). As case of concept, this novel gene-to-reaction formulation was applied to investigate the metabolic effects of the chronic exposure to Aldrin, an endocrine disruptor, on DU145 prostate cancer cells. To this aim we integrated the transcriptomic data from Aldrin-exposed and non-exposed DU145 cells through S-GPR or GPR into a human GSMM by applying different constraint-based-methods. Our study revealed a significant improvement of metabolite consumption/production predictions when S-GPRs are implemented. Furthermore, our computational analysis unveiled important alterations in carnitine shuttle and prostaglandine biosynthesis in Aldrin-exposed DU145 cells that is supported by bibliographic evidences of enhanced malignant phenotype. The method developed in this work enables a more accurate integration of gene expression data into model-driven methods. Thus, the presented approach is conceptually new and paves the way for more in-depth studies of aberrant cancer metabolism and other diseases with strong metabolic component with important environmental and clinical implications.",PMC6694502

Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic, ubiquitous endocrine disrupting chemicals that can cross the placental barrier. Lower levels of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), a biomarker of ovarian reserve, are associated with reduced fertility. We investigated the association between in utero PFAS exposure and AMH levels in female adolescents using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a British pregnancy cohort recruited between 1991 and 1992. Maternal serum samples were collected during pregnancy and analyzed for concentrations of commonly found PFAS-perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). AMH levels were measured in serum of female offspring (mean age, 15.4 years) and log-transformed for analyses. We used a sample of 446 mother-daughter dyads for multivariable linear regression analyses, controlling for maternal age at delivery, pre-pregnancy body-mass index, and maternal education. Multiple imputation was utilized to impute missing values of AMH (61.2%) and covariates. Median PFAS concentrations (ng/mL) were as follows: PFOS 19.8 (IQR:15.1, 24.9), PFOA 3.7 (IQR: 2.8, 4.8), PFHxS 1.6 (IQR: 1.2, 2.2), PFNA 0.5 (IQR: 0.4, 0.7).

We hypothesized that the effect of prenatal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of BPA will be evident during fetal organogenesis and fetal/postnatal growth trajectory. Pregnant ewes were administered BPA subcutaneously from 30 to 90 days of gestation (term 147 days). Fetal organ weight, anthropometric measures, maternal/fetal hormones and postnatal growth trajectory were measured in both sexes. Gestational BPA administration resulted in higher accumulation in male than female fetuses only at fetal day 65, with minimal impact on fetal/maternal steroid milieu in both sexes at both time points. BPA-treated male fetuses were heavier than BPA-treated female fetuses at fetal day 90 whereas this sex difference was not evident in the control group. At the organ level, liver weight was reduced in prenatal BPA-treated female fetuses, while heart and thyroid gland weights were increased in BPA-treated male fetuses relative to their sex-matched control groups. Prenatal BPA treatment also altered the postnatal growth trajectory in a sex-specific manner. Males grew slower during the early postnatal period and caught up later. Females, in contrast, demonstrated the opposite growth trend. Prenatal BPA-induced changes in fetal organ differentiation and early life growth strongly implicate translational relevance of in utero contributions to reproductive and metabolic defects previously reported in adult female offspring.",PMC6810745

The current research aimed to evaluate the effect of BPA on the in vitro maturation (IVM) and subsequent embryo development of mouse oocytes following in vitro fertilization (IVF). IVM was performed in the presence of different concentrations (0, 20, 50, or 100 μg/mL) of BPA. Nuclear maturation, IVF efficiency and embryonic development were determined. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) in the BPA (50 μg/mL) group were evaluated. We explored the ability of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in the IVM medium to rescue the BPA-induced damage by examining changes in nuclear maturation, IVF rate, blastocyst formation, ROS levels and GSH content. Compared with the control, BPA (50 μg/mL) supplementation during oocyte IVM significantly inhibited nuclear maturation and decreased fertilization and blastocyst formation rates. In addition, BPA exposure increased ROS levels and decreased GSH content in oocytes. The addition of NAC weakened the BPA-induced suppression of nuclear maturation, relieved the BPA-induced downregulation of the fertilization and blastocyst formation rates, and mitigated the increased ROS levels and decreased GSH content. BPA affects mouse oocyte maturation and subsequent early embryonic developmental competence following IVF by increasing intracytoplasmic oxidative stress in mature oocytes. NAC can reduce these harmful effects to a certain extent.",PMC6647297

Human exposure to dibutyl phthalate (DBP) occurs via consumer products (7-10 μg/kg/day) and medications (1-233 μg/kg/day). Most DBP toxicity studies have focused on high supraphysiological exposure levels; thus, very little is known about exposures occurring at environmentally relevant levels. CD-1 female mice (80 days old) were treated with tocopherol-stripped corn oil (vehicle control) or DBP dissolved in oil at environmentally relevant (10 and 100 μg/kg/day) or higher (1000 μg/kg/day) levels for 30 days to evaluate effects on DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genes and folliculogenesis. DBP exposure caused dose-dependent effects on folliculogenesis and gene expression. Specifically, animals exposed to the high dose of DBP had more atretic follicles in their ovaries, while in those treated with environmentally relevant doses, follicle numbers were no different from vehicle-treated controls. DBP exposure significantly reduced the expression of DDR genes including those involved in homologous recombination (Atm, Brca1, Mre11a, Rad50), mismatch repair (Msh3, Msh6), and nucleotide excision repair (Xpc, Pcna) in a dose-specific manner. Interestingly, staining for the DNA damage marker, γH2AX, was similar between treatments. DBP exposure did not result in differential DNA methylation in the Brca1 promoter but significantly reduced transcript levels for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1, in the ovary. Collectively, these findings show that oral exposure to environmentally relevant levels of DBP for 30 days does not significantly impact folliculogenesis in adult mice but leads to aberrant ovarian expression of DDR genes.",PMC6930367

Atrazine can seep into the water body through surface, posing a potential threat to the aquatic ecological environment and human drinking water source. In vertebrate, studies have shown that it can affect reproduction and development seriously, but its molecular mechanism for aquatic animals is unknown. Aquaculture is very common in China, especially common carp, whose females grow faster than males. However, the effects of atrazine on the reproduction of carp, especially miRNA, have not been investigated. In this study, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) at two key developmental stages were exposed to atrazine in vitro. Sex ratio was observed to analyze the effect of atrazine on the sex. MiRNA expression profiles were analysed to identify miRNAs related to gonad development and to reveal the atrazine mechanisms interfering with gonad differentiation. The results showed that the sex ratio was biased towards females. Atrazine exposure caused significant alteration of multiple miRNAs. Predicted targets of differently-expressed miRNAs were involved in many reproductive biology signalling pathways. Our results indicate that atrazine promoted the expression of female-biased genes by decreasing miRNAs in primordial gonad. In addition, our results indicate that atrazine can up-regulate aromatase expression through miRNAs, which supports the hypothesis that atrazine has endocrine-disrupting activity by altering the gene expression profile of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonad axis through its corresponding miRNAs.",PMC6636164

Here we study EE2 effects on gene expression around the onset of sex differentiation in a population of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) that suffers from sex ratio distortions. We exposed singly-raised embryos to one dose of 1 ng/L EE2, studied gene expression 10 days before hatching, at the day of hatching, and around the end of the yolk-sac stage, and related it to genetic sex (sdY genotype). We found that exposure to EE2 affects expression of a large number of genes, especially around hatching. These effects were strongly sex-dependent. We then raised fish for several months after hatching and found no evidence of sex reversal in the EE2-exposed fish. We conclude that ecologically relevant (i.e. low) levels of EE2 pollution do not cause sex reversal by simply tipping the balance at early stages of sex differentiation, but that they interfere with sex-specific gene expression.",PMC6631537

Sprague Dawley rat's pups were administered subcutaneously at the neonatal stage from postnatal day PND1 to PND 27. Thirty animals were divided into six experimental groups (6 animals/group). The first group served as control and was provided with normal olive oil. The four groups were treated with 2 μg/kg and 200 μg/kg of BPA and BPS, respectively. The sixth group was given with 50 μg/kg of estradiol dissolved in olive oil as a standard to find the development of dopaminergic tyrosine hydroxylase neurons in AVPV regions. Histological analysis for testicular tissues and immunohistochemistry for brain tissues was performed. The results revealed adverse histopathological changes in testis after administration of different doses of BPA and BPS. These degenerative changes were marked by highly significant (p < 0.001) decrease in tubular and luminal diameters of seminiferous tubule and epithelial height among bisphenols treated groups as compared to control. Furthermore, significantly increased (p < 0.001) TH-ir cell bodies in the AVPV region of the brain with 200 μg/kg dose of BPA and BPS was evident.

The main source of BPA exposure comes from the contamination of food and water by plastic storage containers or disposable bottles, among others, in which case BPA is easily ingested. Exposure to BPA during early pregnancy leads to lifelong effects; however, its effect on the immune system has not been fully studied. Since endocrine and immune systems interact in a bidirectional manner, the disruption of the former may cause permanent alterations of the latter, thus affecting a future anti-parasitic response. In this study, neonate BALB/c mice were exposed to a single dose of BPA (250 μg/kg); once sexual maturity was reached, they were orally infected with Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis). The analyses performed after 5 days of infection revealed a decreased parasitic load in the duodenum of mice in the BPA-treated group. Flow cytometry analyses also revealed changes in the immune cell subpopulations of the infected animals when compared to the BPA-treated group. RT-PCR analyses of duodenum samples showed an increased expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-9 in the BPA-treated group.

In the F2 generation, exposure to DEHP decreased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, apoptosis factors, and ten-eleven translocation compared to controls. It also dysregulated the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) factors. In the F3 generation, ancestral DEHP exposure decreased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, PI3K factors, cell cycle regulators, apoptosis factors, Esr2, DNA methylation mediators, and the percentage of 5-mC compared to controls. Overall, the data show that prenatal and ancestral DEHP exposure greatly suppress gene expression of pathways required for folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis in the ovary in a transgenerational manner and that gene expression may be influenced by DNA methylation. These results provide insight into some of the mechanisms of DEHP-mediated toxicity in the ovary across generations.",PMC6708485

Bisphenol A (BPA), a well-studied xenoestrogen, is known to alter development of estrogen-sensitive organs including the brain, reproductive tract, and mammary gland. Bisphenol S (BPS; 4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol), which has a similar chemical structure to BPA, is also used in many consumer products, but its effects on estrogen-sensitive organs in mammals has not been thoroughly examined. Here, we quantified the effects of perinatal exposures to BPS on the male mouse mammary gland. In our first study, pregnant CD-1 mice were orally exposed to BPS (2 or 200 μg/kg/day) starting on pregnancy day 9 through lactation day 20, and male mammary glands were evaluated on embryonic day 16, prior to puberty, and in early adulthood. We observed modest changes in tissue organization in the fetal gland, and significant increases in growth of the gland induced by developmental BPS exposure in adulthood. In our second study, pregnant CD-1 mice were orally exposed to BPS (2, 200 or 2000 μg/kg/day) starting on pregnancy day 9 through lactational day 2. After weaning, the male pups were administered either oil (vehicle) or an estrogen challenge (1 μg ethinyl estradiol/kg/day) for ten days starting prior to puberty. After the 10-day estrogen challenge, we examined hormone-sensitive outcomes including anogenital index (AGI), weight of the seminal vesicles, and morphological parameters of the mammary gland. Although AGI and seminal vesicle weight were not affected by BPS, we observed dose-specific effects on the response of male mammary glands to the peripubertal estrogen challenge. Because male mammary glands are structurally less developed compared to females, they may provide a simple model tissue to evaluate the effects of putative xenoestrogens.",PMC6736534

C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP develop a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) at adulthood, but similarly-exposed FVB/N mice are not affected. Here we aim to understand the reasons behind this drastic difference that should depend on the genome of the strain. In both backgrounds, pregnant female mice received per os either DEHP or corn oil vehicle and the male filiations were examined. Computer-assisted sperm analysis showed a DEHP-induced decreased sperm count and velocities in C57BL/6J. Sperm RNA sequencing experiments resulted in the identification of the 62 most differentially expressed RNAs. These RNAs, mainly regulated by hormones, produced strain-specific transcriptional responses to prenatal exposure to DEHP; a pool of RNAs was increased in FVB, another pool of RNAs was decreased in C57BL/6J. In FVB/N, analysis of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) impacting SHP identified rs387782768 and rs29315913 respectively associated with absence of the Forkhead Box A3 (Foxa3) RNA and increased expression of estrogen receptor 1 variant 4 (NM_001302533) RNA. Analysis of the role of SNPs modifying SHP binding sites in function of strain-specific responses to DEHP revealed a DEHP-resistance allele in FVB/N containing an additional FOXA1-3 binding site at rs30973633 and four DEHP-induced beta-defensins (Defb42, Defb30, Defb47 and Defb48). A DEHP-susceptibility allele in C57BL/6J contained five SNPs (rs28279710, rs32977910, rs46648903, rs46677594 and rs48287999) affecting SHP and six genes (Svs2, Svs3b, Svs4, Svs3a, Svs6 and Svs5) epigenetically silenced by DEHP. Finally, targeted experiments confirmed increased methylation in the Svs3ab promoter with decreased SEMG2 persisting across generations, providing a molecular explanation for the transgenerational sperm velocity decrease found in C57BL/6J after DEHP exposure. We conclude that the existence of SNP-dependent mechanisms in FVB/N inbred mice may confer resistance to transgenerational endocrine disruption.",PMC6557477

The physicochemical properties of known organic EACs vary greatly and typically require different sample preparation techniques to identify different classes of compounds. EAC sources are similarly diverse, including both endogenous compounds and anthropogenic chemicals found in personal care products, pharmaceuticals, and their transformation products, which are often disposed of to sewers at their end of use. Looking for EACs in sewage sludge proposes a bottom-up, or end-of-use and treatment approach to discover environmentally relevant EACs, since many EACs accumulate in sludges even after application of robust wastewater treatment processes. This study demonstrates an extraction and analytical method capable of detecting a broad spectrum of known and suspected EACs via High Resolution Liquid Chromatography Quadropole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) suspect screening of fourteen California sewage sludge samples. Spike-recovery experiments were performed using twelve carefully selected surrogates to assess different extraction solvents, sample weights, extraction pH values, procedures for combining extracts with different extraction pH's, and solid phase extraction cartridges. Using LC-QTOF-MS, identifications of several other organic compounds in the samples were made, a goal unachievable with unit resolution mass spectrometry. Suspect screening of California sludge samples discovered 118 compounds including hormones, pharmaceuticals, phosphate flame retardants, recreational drugs, antimicrobials, and pesticides. Additionally, 22 of these identified compounds are predicted to interfere with estrogen receptors or other reproductive/developmental pathways based on the VEGA QSAR toxicity prediction model.",PMC7036296

In this work, we integrate epidemiological and experimental evidence toward a whole mixture strategy for risk assessment. To illustrate, we conduct the following four steps in a case study: (1) identification of single EDCs (""bad actors"")-measured in prenatal blood/urine in the SELMA study-that are associated with a shorter anogenital distance (AGD) in baby boys; (2) definition and construction of a ""typical"" mixture consisting of the ""bad actors"" identified in Step 1; (3) experimentally testing this mixture in an in vivo animal model to estimate a dose-response relationship and determine a point of departure (i.e., reference dose [RfD]) associated with an adverse health outcome; and (4) use a statistical measure of ""sufficient similarity"" to compare the experimental RfD (from Step 3) to the exposure measured in the human population and generate a ""similar mixture risk indicator"" (SMRI). The objective of this exercise is to generate a proof of concept for the systematic integration of epidemiological and experimental evidence with mixture risk assessment strategies. Using a whole mixture approach, we could find a higher rate of pregnant women under risk (13%) when comparing with the data from more traditional models of additivity (3%), or a compound-by-compound strategy (1.6%).",PMC6973107

Because of continued persistence and ubiquity of these contaminants, risk of exposure to people living in industrialized countries is still high. Experimental research show that developmental exposure to PCB may alter function of brain pleasure centers and potentially influence disinhibitory behaviors, including tobacco and alcohol use. Yet, the potential effects of developmental PCB exposure on adolescent substance use have not been studied in humans. We used the Child Health and Development Studies (CHDS), a prospective birth cohort study in the Oakland and East Bay areas of California, to investigate associations between prenatal exposure to PCB congeners (66, 74, 99, 118, 138, 153, 170, 180, 187, and 203) and later disinhibitory behaviors in adolescents, specifically alcohol consumption and smoking, in a randomly selected sample (n = 554). Total prenatal PCB exposure was not associated with disinhibitory behaviors, among adolescents. However, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for being a current smoker, was higher in subjects within the third quartile of maternal PCB 66 exposure compared to those below the median (aOR = 1.93; 95% CI 1.05, 3.55). The aOR for drinking >2 alcoholic beverages per week, were also higher for adolescents within the third (aOR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.86, 2.47) and fourth quartile of PCB 66 exposure (aOR = 1.39; 95% CI 0.83, 2.35), but the differences did not reach statistical significance. These results suggest that this specific PCB congener may play a role inducing neurodevelopmental alterations that could potentially increase the risk of becoming a long-term user of tobacco and possibly alcohol.

However, the effects of this polyphenol on the prostate are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-term chrysin exposure on the ventral male and female prostates of adult gerbils. To evaluate the androgenic potential of chrysin, gerbils were also exposed to testosterone. Male and female gerbils were exposed to chrysin (50 mg/kg/day, orally) or testosterone cypionate (1 mg/kg/week, subcutaneously) for 3, 7 and 21 days. Prostates were dissected for morphological, stereological and immunohistochemical analyses. Serum levels of testosterone and 17β-estradiol were measured by ELISA. Serum testosterone levels were not increased by chrysin supplementation in males or females. However, only females treated with chrysin for 21 days showed an increase in estradiol levels. Increased androgen receptor immunoreactivity, higher proliferation rates and glandular hyperplasia were observed in male and female prostates for all chrysin treatment times.

In this study, we investigate the dissolved organic matter (DOM) effect on the release and distribution of EDCs under varied hydrodynamic conditions. A water chamber mesocosm was designed to simulate the hydrodynamic forces in a shallow lake. The contents of bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenol (NP) in colloid-bound and soluble phases were measured under four increasing hydrodynamic intensities that were 5%, 20%, 50%, and 80% of the critical shear stress. The total BPA and NP contents in overlying water grew linearly with the hydrodynamic intensity (R2 = 0.997 and 0.987), from 108.28 to 415.92 ng/L of BPA and 87.73 to 255.52 ng/L of NP. The exponential relationships of EDC content and hydrodynamic intensity in soluble phase (R2 = 0.985 of BPA and 0.987 of NP) and colloid phase (R2 = 0.992 of BPA and 0.995 of NP) were also detected.

We analyzed the ratio (αDOM) of sDOM and cDOM that grew logarithmically with the hydrodynamic intensity (R2 = 0.999). Moreover, the ratio (αEDCs) of BPA and NP contents in soluble and colloid-bound phases varied differently with αDOM.

BPA, bisphenol C (BPC) and a newly synthesized bisphenol A/C (BPA/C) differ only by one methyl group attached to the phenolic ring. Their EC50 values for cytotoxicity and logPOW values are comparable. However, the estrogenic activities of these bisphenols are not comparable and among this group only BPC leads to a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP concentration in HepG2 cells. Conversely, the cell division rate was decreased by BPS, BPA, BPC and BPA/C at 10% toxicity (EC10). At lower concentrations, only BPC significantly affected proliferation. The pro-inflammatory cytokines TGFB1 and TNF were significantly upregulated by BPC only, while SPP1 was upregulated by BPA, BPA/C and BPS. BPC led to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, indicating that this compound is capable of inducing apoptosis.

Importantly, increasing evidence indicates that the impacts of DEHP exposure on reproduction and social behavior persist across multiple generations. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that transgenerational DEHP exposure alters anxiety-like behavior and neural gene expression in both male and female mice. Pregnant CD-1 mice were orally dosed daily with either tocopherol-stripped corn oil or DEHP (20 or 200 μg/kg/day; 500 or 750 mg/kg/day) from gestational day 10.5 until birth to produce the F1 generation. Females from each generation were bred with untreated, unrelated CD-1 males to produce subsequent generations. Behavior and gene expression assays were performed with adult, intact F3 males and females. Transgenerational DEHP exposure increased time spent in the open arm in the elevated plus maze for adult females (750 mg/kg/day lineage), but not males.

The developed analytical protocol for this research requires two main steps: (i) optimized solid phase extraction (SPE) for selective isolation, purification and pre-concentration of target fraction, and (ii) selective temperature-dependent inclusion chromatography for samples analysis via a HPLC-UV-VisDAD system using isocratic elution and internal standard quantification approach. The chromatographic experiment revealed that both β-CD and its hydroxypropyl derivative strongly interact with selected bisphenols. This is in contrast to the steroids and PAHs molecules investigated previously, where a strong interaction with β-cyclodextrin was observed. Integrated areas derived from acquired chromatographic profiles for each individual sample were used as the simple classification variable enabling samples comparison.

Notably, developmental exposure to the mixture of UOG chemicals at the tadpole stage affected metamorphic development and fitness by significantly decreasing body mass after metamorphosis completion. Furthermore, developmental exposure to UOGs resulted in perturbation of immune homeostasis in adult frogs, as indicated by significantly decreased number of splenic innate leukocytes, B and T lymphocytes; and a weakened antiviral immune response leading to increased viral load during infection by the ranavirus FV3.

The presence of endocrine disruption compounds (EDCs) in many coastal marine systems and their associated risks have elicited great concern, especially in the case of nonylphenol (NP), which is classified as a priority contaminate by the U.S. EPA. In this context, batch experiments were conducted to investigate the intracellular absorption, extracellular adsorption and biodegradation of NP by four species of marine microalgae: Phaeocystis globosa, Nannochloropsis oculata, Dunaliella salina and Platymonas subcordiformis. The results showed a sharp reduction of NP in medium containing the four microalgal species during the first 24 h of incubation, and the four species exhibited the greatest capacity for NP adsorption and absorption within 24 h of culture. However, the amount of NP absorbed and adsorbed by all four microalgae decreased with increasing time in culture, and intracellular absorption was greater than extracellular adsorption. After 120 h of exposure to NP, the four species could biodegrade most of the NP in the medium, with efficiencies ranging from 43.43 to 90.94%. In sum, we found that the four microalgae have high biodegradation percentages and can thus improve the bioremediation of NP-contaminated water.",PMC6437302

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) cross the placenta, and evidence suggests that for many children, body burdens may peak during the toddler years. This study aimed to understand the impact of exposure timing by examining both pre- and postnatal exposure to BDE-47, the predominant penta-brominated diphenyl ether congener detected in humans, in relation to thyroid hormone parameters measured during early childhood. Methods: The Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study is a prospective birth cohort of African American and Dominican maternal-child pairs. Pregnant women were recruited from two prenatal clinics in Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx between 1998 and 2006. Participants included 158 children with (i) plasma PBDE concentrations measured at birth and in the toddler years (age 2-3 years), and (ii) serum thyroid parameters measured at three and/or five years of age. Outcomes included concentrations of serum thyrotropin, free thyroxine, and total thyroxine. Results: Children with high exposure to BDE-47 during the prenatal period (-17% [confidence interval -29 to -2]) or toddler age (-19% [confidence interval -31 to -5]) had significantly lower geometric mean thyrotropin levels compared to children with low BDE-47 exposure throughout early life. Associations with thyroxine were also inverse; however, they did not reach statistical significance at the p = 0.05 level. Sex-stratified models suggest associations with postnatal exposure may be stronger among boys compared to girls. Conclusions: The thyroid regulatory system may be sensitive to BDE-47 during pre- and postnatal periods.",PMC6533780

Perturbation of steroid hormone signaling within the uterine milieu could contribute to the development of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. It is well established that bisphenol-A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical with weak estrogenic effects, although little is known about how it affects steroid hormone signaling in the adult uterus. Because BPA acts as a weak E, we hypothesized that chronic exposure to BPA would create an imbalance between E and P signaling and cause changes in the uterus, such as aberrant epithelial proliferation. Indeed, exposure to an environmentally relevant dose of BPA had a uterotrophic affect. BPA-treated mice showed increased proliferation, notably in the glandular epithelium, which are sites of origin for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Increased proliferation appeared to be mediated through a similar mechanism as E-induced proliferation, via activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway and phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases in the epithelium. Interestingly, BPA reduced expression of heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 2 (HAND2), a known mediator of the antiproliferative effects of P. BPA also increased methylation of a CpG island in the Hand2 gene promoter, suggesting that BPA may promote epithelial proliferation through epigenetic silencing of antiproliferative factors like HAND2. Collectively, these findings establish that chronic exposure to BPA impairs steroid hormone signaling in the mouse uterus, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of uterine hyperplasia and cancer.",PMC6482033

Many of these compounds are endocrine disruptors (EDCs) that target estrogen signaling, with effects on reproductive and non-reproductive tissues. We recently reported that zebrafish larvae transiently exposed to the pharmaceutical EDC 4-OH-A display visual deficits as adults. Here, we examine whether these long-term effects are due to compound-induced morphological and/or cellular changes. Zebrafish aged 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, or 7 days post-fertilization (larvae) or 3-4mos (adults) were exposed to either 4-OH-A or PCB1254 for 24 h. After that time, notochord length, eye diameter, inter-eye distance, and heart rate were measured from larvae; and aromatase (estrogen synthase) activity was measured in homogenates of adult brain tissue. In general, indices of larval growth and development were not altered by 24 h exposure to either compound. 4-OH-A potently inhibited aromatase activity, while PCB1254 did not, with inhibition continuing even after removal from treatment. These results support differential function of EDCs and indicate that developmental exposure to 4-OH-A causes sustained inhibition of aromatase, which could be associated with altered adult behaviors.",PMC6516860

However, few studies have evaluated the effect of this exposure on cardiometabolic risk factors in preschool-age children. The health and disease development paradigm (DOHaD) proposes that the physiological and metabolic adaptations triggered by the exposure to these compounds, coupled with postnatal conditions, can modify the risk of disease. In this context, cardiometabolic risk factors in children are not only an important outcome derived from prenatal exposure but a predictor/mediator of the children's future health. To conduct a systematic review of the evidence published in the last 10 years from cohort studies on the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and cardiometabolic risk factors in preschoolers. Studies published from January 1, 2007 to May 1, 2017 in PubMed were analyzed. The research strategy was based on specified keywords and following the application of strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, 16 studies were identified and reviewed. Data were extracted and aspects of quality were assessed using an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies. Only 5 of the 16 studies reviewed analyzed cardiometabolic risk factors in addition to anthropometric measures in children. The cohort studies included in this review suggest that prenatal exposure to low concentrations of EDCs has an impact on anthropometric variables and biochemical parameters in preschool-age children. Positive associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and percentage of fat mass, body mass index, waist circumference, skinfolds and risk of overweight persisted after adjustment for important confounding variables. No association was found with lipid profile and glucose levels.

Testicular development during fetal life is crucial for subsequent male reproductive function. Non-genomic factors such as environmental chemicals, pharmaceuticals and lifestyle have been proposed to impact on human fetal testicular development resulting in subsequent effects on male reproductive health. Whilst experimental studies using animal models have provided support for this hypothesis, more recently a number of experimental studies using human tissues and cells have begun to translate these findings to determine direct human relevance. The objective of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive description of the evidence for effects of prenatal exposure(s) on human fetal testis development and function. We present the effects of environmental, pharmaceutical and lifestyle factors in experimental systems involving exposure of human fetal testis tissues and cells. Comparison is made with existing epidemiological data primarily derived from a recent meta-analysis. For identification of experimental studies, PubMed and EMBASE were searched for articles published in English between 01/01/1966 and 13/07/2018 using search terms including 'endocrine disruptor', 'human', 'fetal', 'testis', 'germ cells', 'testosterone' and related search terms. Abstracts were screened for selection of full-text articles for further interrogation. Epidemiological studies involving exposure to the same agents were extracted from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis. Additional studies were identified through screening of bibliographies of full-texts of articles identified through the initial searches. A total of 25 experimental studies and 44 epidemiological studies were included. Consistent effects of analgesic and phthalate exposure on human fetal germ cell development are demonstrated in experimental models, correlating with evidence from epidemiological studies and animal models. Furthermore, analgesic-induced reduction in fetal testosterone production, which predisposes to the development of male reproductive disorders, has been reported in studies involving human tissues, which also supports data from animal and epidemiological studies. However, whilst reduced testosterone production has been demonstrated in animal studies following exposure(s) to a variety of environmental chemicals including phthalates and bisphenol A, these effects are not reproduced in experimental approaches using human fetal testis tissues. Direct experimental evidence for effects of prenatal exposure(s) on human fetal testis development and function exists. However, for many exposures the data is limited. The increasing use of human-relevant models systems in which to determine the effects of environmental exposure(s) (including mixed exposures) on development and function of human tissues should form an important part of the process for assessment of such exposures by regulatory bodies to take account of animal-human differences in susceptibility.",PMC6601394

This method has the potential to be applied for discovering molecular initiating events (MIEs) in the Adverse Outcome Pathway framework. In this study, we aimed to develop in silico⁻in vivo combined approach as a tool for identifying potential MIEs. We used environmental chemicals from Tox21 database to identify potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) through molecular docking simulation, using estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR) and their homology models in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (NHR-14 and NHR-69, respectively). In vivo validation was conducted on the selected EDCs with C. elegans reproductive toxicity assay using wildtype N2, nhr-14, and nhr-69 loss-of-function mutant strains. The chemicals showed high binding affinity to tested receptors and showed the high in vivo reproductive toxicity, and this was further confirmed using the mutant strains. The present study demonstrates that the binding affinity from the molecular docking potentially correlates with in vivo toxicity. These results prove that our in silico⁻in vivo combined approach has the potential to be applied for identifying MIEs.

Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor (ED), can lead to aberrant immunity and gut microbiota. We determined whether BPA had age-dependent effects on T1D by modulating immune homeostasis following various windows of exposure in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Juvenile NOD females were orally exposed to 0 or 30 µg BPA/kg BW from postnatal day (PND) 28 to PND56. Adult NOD females were exposed to 0 or 300 µg BPA/kg BW. Female and male NOD offspring were exposed to 0 or 300 µg BPA/kg BW perinatally from gestation day 5 to PND28 by dosing the dams. It was found that BPA increased T1D risk in juvenile females with gut microbiota shifted towards pro-inflammation (e.g. increased Jeotgalicoccus). In agreement with our previous study, adult females had a trend of increased T1D and a general increase in immune responses. However, female offspring had a reduced T1D development. Consistently, female offspring had a shift towards anti-inflammation (e.g. decreased pro-inflammatory F4/80+Gr1+ cells). In contrast, BPA had minimal effects on immunity and T1D in male offspring. Thus, it was concluded that BPA had age- and sex-dependent effects on T1D with the alteration of gut microbiota and inflammation being the primary mechanisms for T1D exacerbation in juvenile exposure and decreases of inflammation being responsible for attenuated T1D in perinatally exposed females.",PMC6538306

However, humans are typically exposed to many man-made chemicals simultaneously. Thus, investigating one chemical at a time may not represent the effect of mixtures. To investigate whether urinary concentrations of BPA, parabens, and phthalate metabolite mixtures are associated with reproductive outcomes among women undergoing IVF. This prospective cohort study included 420 women contributing 648 IVF cycles who provided up to two urine samples per cycle prior to oocyte retrieval (N = 1145) between 2006 and 2017 at the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center, and had available urine biomarker data. Urinary concentrations of BPA, parabens, and phthalate metabolites were quantified using isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Intermediate and clinical end-points of IVF treatments were abstracted from electronic medical records. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were used to identify main patterns of BPA, parabens, and phthalate metabolites concentrations. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the association between PCA-derived factor scores, in quartiles, and IVF outcomes, using random intercepts to account for multiple IVF cycles and adjusting for known confounders. Because of temporal trends in exposure, we conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted to women who underwent IVF cycles in the earlier years of study (2006-2012). Urinary concentrations of BPA, parabens, and most phthalate metabolites were significantly lower during the second half of the study period (2013-2017) than during the first half (2006-2012). None of the three factors derived from the PCA [di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), non-DEHP, and paraben] was associated with IVF outcomes in the main analyses. Similarly, BKRM analyses did not identify any associations of individual urinary concentrations of BPA, paraben and phthalate metabolites with IVF outcomes while accounting for correlation between exposures. However, in sensitivity analyses restricted to women who underwent IVF cycles from 2006 to 2012, where concentrations of most phthalates and phenols were higher, there were decreases in implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth across quartiles of the DEHP factor. Specifically, women in the highest quartile of the DEHP factor had, on average, lower probabilities of implantation (-22% p, trend = 0.08), clinical pregnancy (-24% p, trend = 0.14), and live birth (-38% p, trend = 0.06) compared to women in the lowest quartile. Among this group of women, BKMR results did not identify any single contributor driving the decreased probabilities of live birth within the DEHP factor. We confirmed that women undergoing IVF are concurrently exposed to multiple endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). While we found no overall significant associations, we observed diminished pregnancy success with specific clusters of chemicals among women who underwent IVF cycles in earlier years of study, when urinary concentrations of these EDCs were higher.",PMC6469504

With growing evidence of the harmful effects of EDCs on the male reproductive system, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture adversely affects reproductive outcomes and androgen synthesis. In this study, an environmentally relevant composition of phthalates (15% DiNP, 21% DEHP, 36% DEP, 15% DBP, 8% DiBP, and 5% BBzP) that were detected in urine samples of pregnant women in Illinois, United States, was used.

Then, the indices of the reproductive function of the F1 males born to these dams were assessed. Those male mice prenatally exposed to the phthalate mixture had smaller gonads, prostates and seminal vesicles, especially in the 20 µg/kg/day and 500 mg/kg/day phthalate mixture groups, compared to the controls. Importantly, at the age of 12 months, those prenatally exposed mice had significantly lower serum testosterone concentrations accompanied by the decreased mRNA expression of testicular steroidogenic genes (StAR, Cyp11, and Cyp17) and impaired spermatogenesis.

Odds of ASD and intellectual disability did not change with increasing concentration for any specific endocrine disruptor. The effect estimates for each chemical were centered on or near an odds ratio of 1.00 in both models where we applied a shared mean or a mixture prior.

Redox signaling underlies several aspects of WAT physiology; however, the thiol redox environment of WAT has not yet been fully characterized. Dietary and endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposures during development can transiently impact the cellular redox environment, but it is unknown whether these exposures can reprogram the WAT thiol redox environment. To characterize the WAT thiol redox environment, we took a descriptive approach and measured thiol redox parameters using high-performance liquid chromatography in mouse mesenteric (mWAT), gonadal (gWAT) and subinguinal (sWAT) depots. Cysteine (CYSS:CYS) and glutathione (GSSG:GSH) redox potentials (Eh) were more oxidizing in gWAT and sWAT than mWAT. Increased body weight, relative WAT weight and age were associated with oxidizing GSSG:GSH Eh in mWAT in a sex-specific manner.

We carried out a second mouse study with perinatal exposures to bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean and Western high-fat diets (HFDs) to determine whether early-life chemical and dietary factors have long-lasting impacts on mWAT redox parameters. Mice exposed to Mediterranean HFD or BPA had more oxidizing GSSG:GSH mWAT Eh than controls, with more pronounced differences in females. These findings suggest an important role for the thiol redox environment in WAT physiology.

Although the thyroid hormone (TH) disrupting potential of BPA has been thought to be responsible for the neuropsychiatric deficits in the animals that experienced perinatal BPA exposure, the TH availability change at the level of specific brain structures has not been subject to systematic investigation. In the present study the impacts of perinatal BPA exposure (0.1 mg/L in drinking water) spanning gestation and lactation on TH homeostasis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day 21 (PND21) and PND90. As TH regulates brain glucose metabolism at multiple levels，the effects of BPA treatment on glucose metabolism in the brain tissues were also assessed in adult rats. The results showed heterogeneous changes in TH concentration induced by BPA between serum and brain tissues, additionally, in the BPA-treated pups, up-regulated expression of the TH transporter monocarboxylate 8 mRNA at PND21 and increased type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase mRNA expressions at PND21 and PND90 were observed. Meanwhile, decreased glucose metabolism was seen in the PFC and hippocampus, while deficits in locomotor activity, spatial memory and social behaviors occurred in BPA-treated groups. These data support the concept that the developing brain possesses potent mechanisms to compensate for a small reduction in serum TH, such as serum hypothyrodism induced by BPA exposure, however, the long-term negative effect of BPA treatment on TH homeostasis and glucose metabolism may be attributable to neuropsychiatric deficits after mature.",PMC6422808

Two different concentration of TBPH were applied to sensitive early life stages of an ecologically important test species, Fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic killifish), with a well-annotated genome. Exposed fish embryos were sampled for transcriptomics or chemical analysis of parent compound and primary metabolite or observed for development and survival through larval stage. Global transcript profiling using RNA-seq was conducted (n = 16 per treatment) to provide a non-targeted and statistically robust approach to characterize TBPH gene expression patterns. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a dose-response in the expression of genes associated with a surprisingly limited number of biological pathways, but included the aryl hydrocarbon receptor signal transduction pathway, which is known to respond to several toxicologically-important chemical classes. A transcriptional fingerprint using Random Forests was developed that was able to perfectly discriminate exposed vs. non-exposed individuals in test sets. These results suggest that TBPH has a relatively low potential for developmental toxicity (at least in fishes), despite concerns related to its structural similarities to endocrine disrupting chemicals and that the early life stage Fundulus system may provide a convenient test system for exposure characterization.

We found that exposure to 20 000 ng/ml BPA was associated with decreased levels of EV-miR-27b-3p (FC = 0.58, p = .04) and increased levels of its biologically relevant target genes FADD (FC = 1.22, p = .01), IGF1 (FC = 1.59, p = .06), and PPARG (FC = 1.73, p = .001) as compared with the control. In addition, we observed that under the same exposure conditions, the expression levels of miR-27b-3p in granulosa cells were also downregulated (FC = 0.65, p = .03) as compared with the control. Our findings suggest that both cellular and extracellular changes in gene expression may mediate BPA toxicity in granulosa cells.",PMC6804414

PFAAs have been reported to induce estrogen receptor (ER) transactivity, and estrogens may influence human fetal growth. We hypothesize that mixtures of PFAAs may affect human fetal growth by disrupting the ER. We aimed to study the associations between the combined xenoestrogenic activity of PFAAs in pregnant women's serum and offspring BW, length, and head circumference. We extracted the actual mixture of PFAAs from the serum of 702 Danish pregnant women (gestational wk 11–13) enrolled in the Aarhus Birth Cohort (ABC) using solid phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and weak anion exchange. PFAA-induced xenoestrogenic receptor transactivation (XER) was determined using the stable transfected MVLN cell line. Associations between XER and measures of fetal growth were estimated using multivariable linear regression with primary adjustment for maternal age, body mass index (BMI), educational level, smoking, and alcohol intake, and sensitivity analyses with additional adjustment for gestational age (GA) (linear and quadratic). On average, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in XER was associated with a [Formula: see text] [95% confidence interval (CI): [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]] decrease in BW and a [Formula: see text] (95% CI: 0.1, 0.5) decrease in birth length. Upon additional adjustment for GA, the estimated mean differences were [Formula: see text] (95% CI: [Formula: see text], 4) and [Formula: see text] (95% CI: [Formula: see text], 0.0), respectively. Higher-serum PFAA-induced xenoestrogenic activities were associated with lower BW and length in offspring, suggesting that PFAA mixtures may affect fetal growth by disrupting ER function. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1884.",PMC6381822

Endometriosis incidence has risen; however, whether this rise is due to disease awareness or environmental contamination is not known. The objective of this study was to determine if bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol AF (BPAF) potentiate the development of endometriosis and if hormonal status alters how toxicant exposure affects disease. A mouse model of endometriosis, where minced uterine tissue is injected into the peritoneal cavity of a host mouse, was used to examine the effects of BPA and BPAF on endometriosis lesion development in ovariectomized and hormonally intact mice. BPA and BPAF were delivered through diet to include no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the low-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) exposure levels. After six weeks (at necropsy), lesions, ovaries, and blood were collected to examine characteristics, gene expression, and hormonal regulation. BPA and BPAF treatments affected endometriosis in a manner specific to dose and hormonal status of the host mouse. Estrogen and endometriosis-mediated differences in lesion target gene expression also depended on hormonal status. In intact mice, ovarian steroidogenic pathways were disrupted, progesterone levels were lowered, and atretic oocyte numbers were higher with toxicant exposure. BPAF, more so than BPA, resulted in more endometriosis lesion growth, but both toxicants disrupted normal ovarian signaling. These findings further our understanding of the effects and hormonal impacts of BPA and BPAF on endometriosis perturbation in ovariectomized and hormonally intact mice. BPAF appeared to be similar if not more estrogenic than BPA and may be affecting an environmental contribution of the increased incidence of endometriosis. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3802.",PMC6371646

We examined the relationship of prenatal exposure to TCDD with obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in children born to a unique cohort of TCDD-exposed women resulting from a 1976 explosion in Seveso, Italy. In 2014, nearly 40 years after the explosion, we enrolled 611 post-explosion offspring, 2 to 39 years of age, in the Seveso Second Generation Study. In utero TCDD exposure was defined primarily as TCDD concentration measured in maternal serum collected soon after the explosion and alternately as TCDD estimated at pregnancy. We measured height, weight, waist circumference, body fat, blood pressure, and fasting blood levels of lipids and glucose, which were combined to assess body mass index (BMI) and MetS. Children (314 female, 297 male) averaged 23.6 (±6.0) years of age. Among the 431 children ≥18 years, a 10-fold increase in initial maternal TCDD concentration was inversely associated with BMI in daughters (adj-β = -0.99 kg/m2; 95% CI -1.86, -0.12), but not sons (adj-β = 0.41 kg/m2; 95% CI -0.35, 1.18) (p-int = 0.02). A similar relationship was found in the younger children (2-17 years); a 10-fold increase in initial maternal TCDD was inversely associated with BMI z-score (adj-β = -0.59 kg/m2; 95% CI -1.12, -0.06) among daughters, but not sons (adj-β = 0.04 kg/m2; 95% CI -0.34, 0.41) (p-int = 0.03). In contrast, in sons only, initial maternal TCDD was associated with increased risk for MetS (adj-RR = 2.09, 95% CI 1.09, 4.02). Results for TCDD estimated at pregnancy were comparable. These results suggest prenatal TCDD exposure alters cardiometabolic endpoints in a sex-specific manner. In daughters, in utero TCDD is inversely associated with adiposity measures.

This is concerning because DEHP is an endocrine disruptor and ovarian toxicant. Diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) is a DEHP replacement that is a rising human toxicant due to its increased use as a DEHP substitute. However, little is known about the effects of DEHP or DiNP exposure during adulthood on female reproduction. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that DEHP or DiNP exposure during adulthood has long-term consequences for female reproduction in mice. Adult female CD-1 mice (39-40 days) were orally dosed with vehicle control (corn oil), DEHP (20 µg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day), or DiNP (20 µg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. Females were paired with untreated male mice for breeding trials immediately post-dosing and again at 3 and 9 months post-dosing. Immediately post-dosing, DEHP and DiNP did not affect fertility. At 3 months post-dosing, DiNP (20 and 100 µg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day) significantly disrupted estrous cyclicity, and DiNP and DEHP (20 µg/kg/day) significantly reduced the ability of females to get pregnant. At 9 months post-dosing, DiNP significantly disrupted estrous cyclicity (100 µg/kg/day), reduced time to mating (100 µg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day), and borderline reduced percent of females who produced offspring (20 mg/kg/day). At 9 months post-dosing, DEHP (200 µg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day) and DiNP (100 µg/kg/day and 20 and 200 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of male-biased litters.

We studied two samples ([Formula: see text] and 445) from the Puberty Cohort, nested within the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), measuring PFAS in maternal plasma from early gestation. Data on pubertal development were collected biannually from the age of 11 y until full maturation, using web-based questionnaires. Outcomes were age at menarche, voice break, first ejaculation, and Tanner stages 2 to 5 for pubic hair, breast, genital development, and a combined puberty indicator. A regression model for censored data was used to estimate mean difference (months) in age at achieving the pubertal outcomes across tertiles of PFAS concentrations and with a doubling of PFAS concentrations (continuous). For perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a meta-analysis was used to provide a weighted average of the point estimates from samples 1 and 2.

However, the underlying mechanism by which the combination disrupts adipocyte morphology and fat storage remains unknown. The current study evaluated early-life programming by diet and phthalate exposure. During gestation and lactation, pregnant Long-Evans hooded rat dams were fed either a control (C) or high-fat (HF) diet and were orally administered one of three phthalate dosages (0, 200 or 1000 μg/kg/day), yielding six groups of offspring: C-0, C-200, C-1000, HF-0, HF-200 and HF-1000. On postnatal day (PND) 90, gonadal fat pads were collected and analyzed for histology, gene expression and DNA methylation. Differences in body weight were observed only in males. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed larger adipocyte size in HF-0 vs. C-0 females. Exposure to 200 or 1000 μg/kg/day phthalates modulated diet-induced changes in adipose morphology. Compared to C-0 females, HF-0 females also had higher expression of the adipogenesis gene Wnt receptor, frizzled 1 (Fzd1) and the triglyceride cleaving enzyme lipoprotein lipase (Lpl). These increases in gene expression were accompanied by lower DNA methylation surrounding the transcription start sites of the two genes. Diet-driven effects were observed in unexposed females but not in phthalate-treated rats. Results suggest a sex-specific association between perinatal HF diet and body weight, adipocyte size and DNA methylation.

Pubertal timing was assessed among 179 girls and 159 boys every 9 months between ages 9 and 13 using clinical Tanner staging. Accelerated failure time models were used to obtain mean shifts of pubertal timing associated with concentrations of prenatal and peripubertal biomarkers. In girls, we observed earlier onset of pubic hair development with prenatal urinary MEP concentrations and earlier menarche with prenatal triclosan and 2,4-dichlorophenol concentrations. Regarding peripubertal biomarkers, we observed: earlier breast development, pubic hair development and menarche with methyl paraben; earlier menarche with propyl paraben; and later pubic hair development with 2,5-dichlorophenol. In boys, we observed no associations with prenatal urinary biomarker concentrations and only one association with peripubertal concentrations: earlier genital development with propyl paraben.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are associated with metabolic syndrome and other endocrine abnormalities in humans. This led us to hypothesize that EDCs are detectable in horse plasma and play a role in the pathophysiology of EMS. EDCs acting through the aryl hydrocarbon and estrogen receptors, were measured in plasma of 301 horses from 32 farms.

TEQ was negatively associated with plasma fat extracted and batch analyzed. EEQ was positively associated with pregnancy and batch analyzed, and negatively associated with being male and superfund score ≤100 miles of the farm. Of particular interest, serum glucose and insulin, glucose and insulin post oral sugar challenge, and leptin concentrations were associated with EEQ, and serum triglyceride concentration was associated with TEQ.

These EDCs dysregulate a number of biomolecules and pathways, including microRNAs. MicroRNAs can be carried in transport systems called extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are present in most biofluids. EVs in the follicular fluid, which fills the ovarian follicle and influences oocyte developmental competency, carry microRNAs (EV-miRNAs) that have been associated with In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether EDCs affect EV-miRNAs in follicular fluid. This study sought to determine whether urinary concentrations of phenols and phthalates biomarkers are associated with EV-miRNAs expression in follicular fluid collected from women undergoing IVF treatment. This cross-sectional study included 130 women recruited between January 2014 and August 2016 in a tertiary university-affiliated hospital. Participants provided urine samples during ovarian stimulation and on the day of oocyte retrieval. We assessed urinary concentrations of five phenols, eight phthalate metabolites, and one phthalate alternative metabolite. EV-miRNAs were isolated from follicular fluid and their expression profiles were measured using the TaqMan Open Array® Human microRNA panel. We fitted multivariable linear regression models and principal component analysis to examine associations between individual and molar sums of exposure biomarkers and EV-miRNAs. Of 754 miRNAs tested, we detected 133 EV-miRNAs in the microRNA array which expressed in at least 50% of the follicular fluid samples. After adjusting for multiple testing, we identified eight EV-miRNAs associated with individual phenols and phthalate metabolites, as well as molar ΣDEHP that met a q < 0.10 false-discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-106b, hsa-miR-374a, and hsa-miR15b was associated with mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate concentrations, hsa-let-7c with concentrations mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), and the sum of metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, hsa-miR-24 with mono-n-butyl phthalate concentrations, hsa-miR-19a with cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid monohydroxy isononyl ester (MHiNCH), and hsa-miR-375 with ethyl paraben concentrations. Using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, gene targets and pathways of these EV-miRNAs were predicted in silico and 17 KEGG FDR-significant pathways related to follicular development and oocyte competence were identified. Our results show that urinary concentrations of select phenol and phthalate metabolites are correlated with altered EV-miRNAs expression in follicular fluid. These findings may provide insight regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying adverse effects of phenol and phthalate exposure on female fertility.",PMC6343661

Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used for targeted analysis of selected EDCs as well as to identify and quantify a few metabolites using post-acquisition data mining. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was applied to liquid matrices in order to reduce matrix effects and provide required sample concentration and ultimately, high sensitivity and selectivity of measurements. SPE recoveries in liquid samples ranged from 49 to 140% with method quantification limits not exceeding 1 ng L-1 for the majority of EDCs. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was applied to solid samples and when followed by SPE, it permitted the analysis of EDCs in digested sludge. MAE/SPE recoveries varied from 11 to 186% and MQLs between 0.03 and 8.1 ng g-1 with the majority of compounds showing MQLs below 2 ng g-1. Mass error for quantifier and qualifier ions was below 5 ppm when analysing river water and effluent wastewater and below 10 ppm when analysing influent wastewater and solid samples. The method was successfully applied to environmental samples, with 33 EDCs identified and quantified in wastewater and receiving waters. In addition, several EDCs were found in digested sludge, which confirms that for a more comprehensive understanding of exposure patterns and environmental impact, analysis of solids cannot be neglected. Finally, post-acquisition data mining permitted the identification and quantification of a metabolite of BPA and the identification of a metabolite of 4-Cl-3-methylphenol.

However, the personal characteristics associated with phthalate exposure are unclear. We sought to describe personal, behavioral, and reproductive characteristics associated with phthalate metabolite concentrations in an ongoing study nested within the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). We measured thirteen phthalate metabolites in two or three archived urine samples collected in 1993-2001 from each of 1257 WHI participants (2991 observations). We fit multivariable generalized estimating equation models to predict urinary biomarker concentrations from personal, behavioral, and reproductive characteristics. Older age was predictive of lower concentrations of monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-carboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP), mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP), and the sum of di-n-butyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDBP). Phthalate metabolite concentrations varied by race/region, with generally higher concentrations observed among non-Whites and women from the West region. Higher neighborhood socioeconomic status predicted lower MBzP concentrations, and higher education predicted lower monoethyl phthalate (MEP) and higher concentrations of the sum of metabolites of di-isobutyl phthalate (ΣDiBP). Overweight/obesity predicted higher MBzP, MCOP, monocarboxynonyl phthalate (MCNP), MCPP, and the sum of metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (ΣDEHP) and lower MEP concentrations. Alcohol consumption predicted higher concentrations of MEP and ΣDBP, while current smokers had higher ΣDBP concentrations. Better diet quality as assessed by Healthy Eating Index 2005 scores predicted lower concentrations of MBzP, ΣDiBP, and ΣDEHP. Factors predictive of lower biomarker concentrations included increased age and healthy behaviors (e.g. lower alcohol intake, lower body mass index, not smoking, higher quality diet, and moderate physical activity). Racial group (generally higher among non-Whites) and geographic regions (generally higher in Northeast and West compared to South regions) also were predictive of phthalate biomarker concentrations.",PMC6347530

This has raised concerns about the accumulation of EDCs in aquatic species via continuous exposure. This study evaluated the uptake of EDCs by quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), an invasive species in a water supply reservoir. The field sampling results showed that steroid hormones were not detected in the water samples, and only pharmaceuticals and personal care products were present (0.49 to 36 ng/L). Additionally, testosterone was the most abundant steroid in the mussel tissue (6.3 to 20 ng/g dry weight), and other synthetic chemicals (i.e., bisphenol A, triclosan, and salicylic acid) were also detected in the mussel tissue (24 to 47 ng/g dry weight). After being exposed to exogenous EDCs for 7, 21, and 42 days under controlled laboratory conditions, testosterone was not detected in the mussel anymore, but bisphenol A, triclosan, and salicylic acid were found at relatively high levels in the mussel tissue, although the concentrations did not increase over time.

Spanish brooms are flowering plants, which are native and abundant to Mediterranean regions. The functionalized fibers (FF) were found to have the best adsorption efficiency at pH 5, due to the optimal hydrophobic interaction between the FF fiber and BPA. Adsorption kinetics of BPA was found to fit well a pseudo-second order reaction. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted by Langmuir and Freundlich models. A very fast and simple regeneration method was developed and it was observed that adsorption capacity of the fibers was kept almost unchanged after 3 consecutive uses. Bottled water and synthetic wastewater were also tested to assess the efficiency of the process under more realistic water and wastewater treatment conditions. It was found that BPA removal was slightly decreased from 77% in ultrapure water to 64% in synthetic wastewater matrix, indicating that FF has a high selectivity toward BPA, even in the presence of other organic compounds.

However, no human study has investigated the association between pregnancy exposure to parabens, a class of EDCs, and pregnancy glucose levels, a risk factor for GDM. Furthermore, little is known about this association in subfertile women-a group at high risk of GDM. A total of 241 women from the Environment and Reproductive Health Study had data available on 1st and/or 2nd trimester urinary methylparaben, propylparaben, and butylparaben concentrations, and blood glucose levels after the glucose loading test (GLT), a non-fasting 50 g glucose loading test taken at late 2nd trimester. Trimester-specific associations between specific gravity adjusted methylparaben, butylparaben, and propylparaben with adjusted mean of pregnancy glucose levels were evaluated in linear regression models, using quartiles of each paraben's distribution, and as a paraben mixture, using mutual adjustment and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), a recently proposed method for investigating chemical mixtures that flexibly models the joint effect of chemicals. Investigating parabens one at the time did not provide any significant results. When investigating parabens as a chemical mixture with both multiple regression and BKMR, we observed positive associations of butylparaben (e.g comparing the 4th and 1st quartiles) with glucose levels, for both the 1st trimester (adjusted difference=12.5 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.9, 24.2) and 2nd trimester (adjusted difference=11.2 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.2, 22.3), and a negative association between 1st trimester propylparaben and glucose (adjusted difference=-22.3 mg/dL; 95% CI: -43.2, -1.4). We found 1st trimester butylparaben and propylparaben urinary concentrations to be associated with glucose levels in a pregnancy cohort of women at high risk of GDM, even after adjusting for potential confounders.

In this study, we determined the transgenerational effects (F3) of BPA on metabolic health and pancreatic islets in our model. Adult F3 LowerB and UpperB male offspring had increased body weight relative to Controls, however glucose tolerance was similar in the three groups. F3 LowerB, but not UpperB, males had reduced β-cell mass and smaller islets which was associated with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Similar to F1 and F2 BPA male offspring, staining for markers of T-cells and macrophages (CD3 and F4/80) was increased in pancreas of F3 LowerB and UpperB male offspring, which was associated with changes in cytokine levels. In contrast to F3 BPA males, LowerB and UpperB female offspring had comparable body weight, glucose tolerance and insulin secretion as Controls.

The aim of the current study was to examine the association between triclosan (TCS) and PCOS, and explore possible mechanisms on how TCS may contribute to the development of clinical manifestations of PCOS. Cross-sectional study. This study was conducted in one tertiary-level hospital located in Zhejiang, China. A total of 674 infertile women at 18-45 years of age were recruited in 2014-2015. Participants with (n=84) and without (n=212) PCOS with urinary TCS concentration available were included in the analyses. Urinary TCS concentration was measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry. Logistic regression model was used to examine the association between TCS and PCOS. Fractional polynomial regression models were built to fit the potential non-linear relationship between TCS concentrations and luteinising hormone (LH) and LH/follicle stimulate hormone (FSH). The PCOS group had significantly higher level of TCS concentration than the non-PCOS group (the median of TCS (IQR), μg/g creatinine: 1.49 (0.68-3.80) vs 1.06 (0.52-3.02), p=0.0407).

To assess the association between phthalate metabolites and BPA with early pregnancy endpoints in a cohort of women followed from before conception. We quantified 11 phthalate metabolites and BPA in 137 conception cycles from naturally conceived clinical pregnancies. Phthalate metabolites and BPA concentrations were measured in a pooled sample of three daily morning urine specimens. Daily urinary hormone measurements had previously been used to define ovulation, implantation, and corpus luteum rescue. We assessed associations between conception cycle exposures (phthalate biomarkers and BPA) and 1) time from ovulation to implantation; 2) type of corpus luteum rescue (timing and pattern of rise in progesterone: early, late, or no rise); and 3) rate of initial rise in hCG. Mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) and mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) were associated with earlier implantation (6-8 days vs. 9 days (the most commonly observed); per natural log-unit, OR (95% CI) = 2.8 (1.2, 6.7) and OR (CI) = 2.1 (1.2, 3.7), respectively). Monoethyl phthalate (MEP) was associated with later implantation (10-12 days vs. 9 days); OR (CI) = 1.5 (1.0, 2.1). Compared with implantation on day 9, BPA was significantly associated with both earlier and later implantation (OR=2.2 for both).

A qualitative study based on the Health Belief Model was carried out through interviews of pregnant women and focus group with perinatal, environmental health and prevention professionals in 2015 in the city of Poitiers, France. Then, determinants of risk perception were included in a questionnaire administered to 300 women in the perinatal period through a quantitative study. Scores were subsequently calculated. Perception of EDC risk was defined as perceived severity for different stages of the infant's development and perceived susceptibility to EDC exposure. The determinants reported in the qualitative study were: age, strong maternal figure, socio-professional category, level of knowledge, and involuntariness of exposure. Age and level of knowledge were confirmed in our statistical model as determinants. Mean score of EDC risk perception was 55.0 ± 18.3 on 100 points.

Few epidemiologic studies have examined the impact of non-persistent chemicals specifically on TTP, and the results of these studies have not been synthesized. We undertook a systematic review to summarize the strength of evidence for associations of common non-persistent chemicals with couple fecundability and to identify gaps and limitations in the literature, with the aim of informing policy decisions and future research. We performed an electronic search of English language literature published between 1 January 2007 and 25 August 2017 in MEDLINE, EMBASE.com, Global Health, DART/TOXLINE, POPLINE and DESTAF. We included human retrospective and prospective cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies that examined phthalates, bisphenol A, triclosan, triclocarban, benzophenones, parabens and glycol ethers in consumer products, and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome among women, men and couples conceiving without medical assistance. We excluded editorials, opinion pieces, introductions to special sections, articles that described only lifestyle (e.g. caffeine, stress) or clinical factors (e.g. semen parameters, IVF success). Standardized forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software and completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. The search returned 3456 articles. There were 15 papers from 12 studies which met inclusion criteria, of which eight included biomarkers of chemical exposure. Studies varied widely in terms of exposure characterization, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Among the studies that measured exposure using biospecimens, results were equivocal for associations between either male or female phthalate exposure and TTP. There was preliminary support for associations of female exposure to some parabens and glycol ethers and of male exposure to benzophenone with longer TTP, but further research and replication of these results are needed. The results provided little to no indication that bisphenol A, triclocarban or triclosan exposure was associated with TTP. Despite a growing literature on couple exposure to non-persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals and fecundability, evidence for associations between biologically measured exposures and TTP is limited. Equivocal results with different non-persistent chemical compounds and metabolites complicate the interpretation of our findings with respect to TTP, but do not preclude action, given the documented endocrine disrupting effects on other reproductive outcomes as well as fetal development. We therefore advocate for common-sense lifestyle changes in which both females and males seeking to conceive minimize their exposure to non-persistent chemicals. CRD42018084304.",PMC6295794

Mothers reported on children's behavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at age 7 (650 singletons and 138 twins). Difficulties in total behavior (i.e., emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems) and prosocial behavior were classified using validated cut-offs. We used logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to estimate the odds of having difficulties per exposure category. In total, 111 children (12.1%) had total behavioral difficulties and 60 (6.5%) had difficulties in prosocial behavior.

Higher PFOS levels were associated with increased odds of having behavioral difficulties (OR per SD of log PFOS = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.03-1.65).

Although it has been reported to affect the development of a variety of fetal reproductive tissues, data on the effect of fetal BPA exposure on oviducts were extremely limited and were only available in mice. To determine if there are adverse effects of gestational BPA exposure on fetal oviduct, we exposed pregnant rhesus macaques with female fetuses to oral or nonoral BPA during the last trimester of gestation (day 100 to term). After the treatment, fetal oviducts were collected for morphology evaluation. BPA exposure altered the percentages of different cell types (ciliated, nonciliated, and secretory) in the fetal oviduct and resulted in a significant high ciliated cell population in the BPA-exposed fetal oviduct. The distribution of ciliated cells on the epithelium in the BPA-exposed fetal oviduct was also altered. Gestational BPA exposure reduced the expression of mucosubstance and uteroglobin in secretory cells in the fetal oviduct. A comparison of the outcome of the fetal oviduct studies with similar outcomes previously reported in the lung from the same fetuses demonstrates that BPA exhibits opposite effects in these two organs. In conclusion, the BPA-associated alterations in the fetal oviduct could potentially affect the oviduct morphology and function later in life with a negative impact on fertility.

Rats were treated with a PCB commercial mixture, Aroclor 1221 (A1221), estradiol benzoate (EB) as a positive control for estrogenic effects of A1221, or the vehicle (4% DMSO), on embryonic day (E) 16 and 18. In adult F1 offspring, we first conducted tests of ultrasonic vocalization (USV) calls in a sociosexual context as a measure of motivated communications.

In a test of sociosexual preference for a hormone-vs. a non-hormone-primed opposite sex conspecific, male (but not female) nose-touching with opposite-sex rats was significantly diminished by EDCs. Gene expression profiling was conducted in two brain regions that are part of the social decision-making network in the brain: the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and the ventromedial nucleus (VMN). In both regions, many more genes were affected by A1221 or EB in females than males. In female MPN, A1221 changed expression of steroid hormone receptor and neuropeptide genes (e.g., Ar, Esr1, Esr2, and Kiss1). In male MPN, only Per2 was affected by A1221. The VMN had a number of genes affected by EB compared to vehicle (females: Kiss1, Kiss1r, Pgr; males: Crh) but not A1221. These differences between EB and A1221 indicate that the mechanism of action of A1221 goes beyond estrogenic pathways.

Twenty-one pregnant C57BL/6mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group, a group receiving 0.2 μg/mL (LBPA), and a group receiving 2 μg/mL of BPA (HBPA), all via drinking water from gestational day 6 to the end of lactation. After weaning, one male mouse was randomly selected from each group (n = 7/group); these three mice were fed a normal diet and drinking water for 1 month. Levels of serum testosterone (T) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were then measured in all mice. Sperm count and the proportion of sperm malformation were also determined. The levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein expression in the testis tissue were determined. Analysis showed that the proportion of sperm malformation increased in the LBPA and HBPA groups (p < 0.05). Sperm count significantly decreased only in the HBPA group (p < 0.05), while the levels of serum TNF-α increased in the LBPA and HBPA groups (p < 0.05).

In human placenta, the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the ABCB1 gene, extrudes its substrates from the trophoblasts back into the maternal circulation. Alterations in levels of placental P-gp could therefore significantly affect fetal exposure to xenobiotics that are P-gp substrates. The ABCB1 promoter contains many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the genome, SNPs are not arrayed as independent variants but as combinations forming defined haplotypes. Recently, we determined the haplotype sequences encompassing the ABCB1 promoter SNPs and found that promoter haplotypes differentially affect ABCB1 promoter activity. Here we investigate the effect of BPA and BPS on ABCB1 promoter activity by testing the hypothesis that BPA and BPS exposure affect ABCB1 promoter activity in a haplotype-dependent manner. Our data indicate that acute exposure to 50 nM BPA induced a significant haplotype-dependent increase in ABCB1 promoter activity (P < .05). However, acute exposure to 0.5 nM BPS induced a significant decrease (P < .05) in promoter activity that was haplotype-dependent. Chronic exposure to BPA and BPS individually (5 nM and 0.3 nM, respectively) or as a mixture (5 nM BPA:1.5 nM BPS) induced significant haplotype-dependent increases (P < .01) in ABCB1 promoter activity.

Subsequent rodent studies demonstrated developmental effects of exposure with repercussions on adult health and fertility (e.g., [2-9]; reviewed in [10-17]). Studies in monkeys, humans, fish, and worms suggest BPA effects extend across species (e.g., [18-30]; reviewed in [31-33]). Widespread use has resulted in ubiquitous environmental contamination and human BPA exposure. Consumer concern resulted in ""BPA-free"" products produced using structurally similar bisphenols that are now detectable environmental and human contaminants (e.g., [34-41]). We report here studies initiated by meiotic changes mirroring our previous BPA experience and implicating exposure to BPS (a common BPA replacement) from damaged polysulfone cages. Like with BPA [1, 2, 5], our data show that exposure to common replacement bisphenols induces germline effects in both sexes that may affect multiple generations. These findings add to growing evidence of the biological risks posed by this class of chemicals. Rapid production of structural variants of BPA and other EDCs circumvents efforts to eliminate dangerous chemicals, exacerbates the regulatory burden of safety assessment, and increases environmental contamination. Our experience suggests that these environmental contaminants pose a risk not only to reproductive health but also to the integrity of the research environment. EDCs, like endogenous hormones, can affect diverse processes. The sensitivity of the germline allows us to detect effects that, although not immediately apparent in other systems, may induce variability that undermines experimental reproducibility and impedes scientific advancement.",PMC6156992

Generalized estimating equations with robust standard errors were used to assess the associations for twins. Chemicals were largely quantified above the limits of detection (>99% for PFOS and PFOA; 90% for BPA). Overall, we observed no significant associations between PFASs and birth size irrespective of plurality of birth. However, among twins, BPA was associated with decreases in gestational age (adjusted β = -0.09 weeks; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -0.16, -0.02) and birthweight (adjusted β = -32.52 g; 95% CI: -60.99, -4.05), head circumference (adjusted β = -0.18 cm; 95% CI: -0.38, -0.02) and increased PI in singletons (adjusted β = 0.02 cm; 95% CI: 0.004, 0.04).

Limited evidence suggests consequences on the F2 generation, exposed as germ cells within the F1 fetus. These F2s provide a unique window into the programming effects of EDCs. This study assessed intergenerational effects of EDC exposure on adult physiology and behavior in Sprague-Dawley rats. Pregnant rats were exposed to either a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture, Aroclor 1,221 (A1221), the fungicide vinclozolin (VIN), or the vehicle (VEH) (6% dimethylsulfoxide in sesame oil) alone. A1221 is weakly estrogenic, while VIN is antiandrogenic, enabling us to compare different classes of EDCs. The F1 male and female offspring were bred to generate the paternal- and maternal-lineage F2 generation. This F2 generation was assessed for physiological outcomes, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), and sexual behavior in adulthood. Each EDC caused phenotypic effects in a sex- and lineage-dependent manner. The most robustly affected group was the paternal-lineage males. F2 VIN paternal male descendants had increased body weight throughout the lifespan, lower concentrations of circulating estradiol, and lower adrenal and testicular indices. Both VIN and A1221 paternal-lineage males also exhibited the greatest number of changes in the characteristics of USVs in response to an opposite-sex animal and changes in sexual behaviors in a mating test. Exposure of rats to EDCs at the germ cell stage led to differences in the physiological and behavioral phenotype later in life, especially in males.

We quantified urinary concentrations of eight phthalate metabolites and BPA at two time points during pregnancy among participating mothers ([Formula: see text]) and conducted clinical Tanner staging of puberty on their children every 9 months between 9 and 13 y of age. We conducted accelerated failure time models and examined the role of child overweight/obese status in this association. The sum of urinary metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate [Formula: see text], monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and BPA were associated with later onset of at least one of the three outcomes assessed in girls (thelarche, pubarche, or menarche) and with earlier onset of at least one of the two outcomes assessed in boys (gondarche and pubarche). We found that monocarboxynonyl phthalate, monocarboxyoctyl phthalate, mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate, and BPA were associated with later pubarche and menarche mostly among normal-weight girls but not overweight/obese girls. MBzP was associated with later thelarche in all girls, and [Formula: see text] was associated with later thelarche and menarche in all girls.

The process is made more difficult when accounting for complex human exposures to multiple environmental chemicals. Herein we propose a new class of nonlinear statistical models for human data that incorporate and evaluate regulatory guideline values into analyses of health effects of exposure to chemical mixtures using so-called 'desirability functions' (DFs). The DFs are incorporated into nonlinear regression models to allow for the simultaneous estimation of points of departure for risk assessment of combinations of individual substances that are parts of chemical mixtures detected in humans. These are, in contrast to published so-called biomonitoring equivalent (BE) values and human biomonitoring (HBM) values that link regulatory guideline values from in vivo studies of single chemicals to internal concentrations monitored in humans. We illustrate the strategy through the analysis of prenatal concentrations of mixtures of 11 chemicals with suspected endocrine disrupting properties and two health effects: birth weight and language delay at 2.5 years. The strategy allows for the creation of a Mixture Desirability Function i.e., MDF, which is a uni-dimensional construct of the set of single chemical DFs; thus, it focuses the resulting inference to a single dimension for a more powerful one degree-of-freedom test of significance. Based on the application of this new method we conclude that the guideline values need to be lower than those for single chemicals when the chemicals are observed in combination to achieve a similar level of protection as was aimed for the individual chemicals. The proposed modeling may thus suggest data-driven uncertainty factors for single chemical risk assessment that takes environmental mixtures into account.",PMC6261378

For in vitro BPA exposure, primary pre-adipocyte cell cultures from healthy newborns were utilized. We studied pre-adipocyte proliferative and differentiation effects of BPA and explored putative signal factors which partly explain adipose responses and underlying epigenetic mechanisms mediated by BPA. Maternal BPA-induced offspring adiposity, hypertrophic adipocytes and increased adipose tissue protein expression of pro-adipogenic and lipogenic factors. Consistent with in vivo data, in vitro BPA exposure induced a dose-dependent increase in pre-adipocyte proliferation and increased adipocyte lipid content.

Timed pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed to vehicle, BPA (0.5, 5, 50 mg/kg), BPAF (0.05, 0.5, 5 mg/kg), or BPS (0.05, 0.5, 5 mg/kg) via oral gavage between gestation days 10–17.

In the bisphenol-exposed mice, accelerated mammary gland development was evident during early puberty and persisted into adulthood. By late adulthood, mammary glands from bisphenol-exposed female offspring exhibited adverse morphology in comparison with controls; most prominent were undifferentiated duct ends, significantly more lobuloalveolar hyperplasia and perivascular inflammation, and various tumors, including adenocarcinomas. Effects were especially prominent in the BPAF 5 mg/kg and BPS 0.5 mg/kg groups. Serum steroid concentrations and mammary mRNA levels of Esr1, Pgr, Ar, and Gper1 were similar to controls. These data demonstrate that prenatal exposure of mice to BPAF or BPS induced precocious development of the mammary gland, and that siblings were significantly more susceptible to spontaneous preneoplastic epithelial lesions and inflammation, with an incidence greater than that observed in vehicle- and BPA-exposed animals. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3189.",PMC6108869

We aimed at revealing the sex-specific miRNA expression profile of single porcine blastocysts developing in gilts orally exposed to exogenous estradiol-17 (E2). Therefore we analyzed the miRNA profile specifically focusing on isomiRs and potentially embryo-specific miRNAs. Deep sequencing of small RNA (small RNA-seq) result in the detection of miRNA sequences mapping to known and predicted porcine miRNAs as well as novel miRNAs highly conserved in human and cattle. A set of highly abundant miRNAs and a large number of rarely expressed miRNAs were identified by using a small RNA analysis pipeline, which was integrated into a novel Galaxy workflow specifically benefits incompletely annotated species. In particular, orthologue species information increased the total number of annotated miRNAs, while mapping to other non-coding RNAs avoided falsely annotated miRNAs. Neither the low nor the high dose of E2 treatment (10 and 1000 µ E2/kg body weight daily, respectively) affected the miRNA profile in blastocysts despite the distinct differential mRNA expression and DNA methylation found in previous studies. The high number of generated sequence reads enabled a comprehensive analysis of the isomiR repertoire showing various templated and non-templated modifications. Furthermore, potentially blastocyst-specific miRNAs were identified. In pre-implantation embryos, numerous distinct isomiRs were discovered indicating a high complexity of miRNA expression.

Human exposure to environmental estrogens occurs throughout the life span, but the urologic health risks in men are largely unknown. Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor implicated in male urogenital malformations. Given the role of estrogens in male LUTS, we studied the effects of BPA administered in combination with testosterone (T) on the urinary voiding behavior of adult male mice. Adult male mice underwent subcutaneous implantation with slow-release pellets of 25 mg BPA or 2.5 mg estradiol-17β (E2), plus 25 mg T, and were compared with untreated (UNT) mice that underwent sham surgery. We studied urinary voiding behavior noninvasively for 1 mo before treatment and for 4 mo after treatment. After euthanasia, we evaluated bladder volume and mass. Mice treated with T+BPA had increased bladder volume ( P < 0.05) and mass ( P < 0.01) compared with UNT mice. After 4 mo of treatment with T+BPA, three of five mice developed voiding dysfunction in the form of droplet voiding or an intermediate pattern of voiding different from both UNT and T+E2-treated mice.

This region is particularly important given its involvement in executive functions and implication in the pathology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we examine the long-term effects of perinatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds, the phthalates, on the mPFC and associated behavior. This investigation is pertinent as humans are ubiquitously exposed to phthalates through a variety of consumer products and phthalates can readily cross the placenta and be delivered to offspring via lactation. Pregnant dams orally consumed an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates at 0, 200, or 1000 μg/kg/d through pregnancy and for 10 d while lactating. As adults, offspring were tested in an attentional set-shifting task, which assesses cognitive flexibility. Brains were also examined in adulthood for stereological quantification of the number of neurons, glia, and synapses within the mPFC. We found that, independent of sex, perinatal phthalate exposure at either dose resulted in a reduction in neuron number, synapse number, and size of the mPFC and a deficit in cognitive flexibility. Interestingly, the number of synapses was correlated with cognitive flexibility, such that rats with fewer synapses were less cognitively flexible than those with more synapses. These results demonstrate that perinatal phthalate exposure can have long-term effects on the cortex and behavior of both male and female rats.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans globally are exposed on a daily basis to a variety of phthalates, which are endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The effects of phthalate exposure on the developing brain, especially on cognitively relevant regions, such as the mPFC, are not known. Here, we use a rat model of human prenatal exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates and find that there is an appreciable reduction in neuron number, synapse number, and size of the mPFC and a deficit in cognitive flexibility. These results may have serious implications for humans given that the mPFC is involved in executive functions and is implicated in the pathology of many neuropsychiatric disorders.",PMC6070669

After exposing embryos to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 parts per billion (ppb) ATZ, we monitored the expression of cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (cyp17a1), glyoxalase I (glo1), ring finger protein 14 (rnf14), salt inducible kinase 2 (sik2), tetratricopeptide domain 3 (ttc3), and tumor protein D52 like 1 (tpd52l1) at multiple embryonic time points to determine normal expression and if ATZ exposure altered expression. Only cyp17a1 had normal dynamic expression, but ttc3 and tpd52l1 had ATZ-related expression changes before 72 h. Larvae exposed to 0.3 ppb ATZ had increased brain length, while larvae exposed to 30 ppb ATZ were hypoactive. Proteomic analysis identified altered protein abundance in pathways related to cellular function, neurodevelopment, and genital-tract cancer. The results indicate embryonic ATZ toxicity involves interactions of multiple pathways. This is the first report of proteomic alterations following embryonic exposure to atrazine, an environmentally persistent pesticide and common water contaminant. Although the transcriptomic alterations in larval zebrafish with embryonic atrazine exposure have been reported, neither the time at which gene expression changes occur nor the resulting proteomic changes have been investigated. This study seeks to address these knowledge gaps by evaluating atrazine's effect on gene expression through multiple time points during embryogenesis, and correlating changes in gene expression to pathological alterations in brain length and functional changes in behavior. Finally, pathway analysis of the proteomic alterations identifies connections between the molecular changes and functional outcomes associated with embryonic atrazine exposure.",PMC6193558

Here we used tadpoles of the amphibian Xenopus laevis and the ranavirus Frog virus 3 (FV3) as a model relevant to aquatic environment conservation research for investigating the immunotoxic effects of exposure to a mixture of 23 UOG-associated chemicals with EDC activity. Xenopus tadpoles were exposed to an equimass mixture of 23 UOG-associated chemicals (range from 0.1 to 10 µg/l) for 3 weeks prior to infection with FV3. Our data show that exposure to the UOG chemical mixture is toxic for tadpoles at ecological doses of 5 to 10 µg/l. Lower doses significantly altered homeostatic expression of myeloid lineage genes and compromised tadpole responses to FV3 through expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and Type I IFN genes, correlating with an increase in viral load. Exposure to a subset of 6 UOG chemicals was still sufficient to perturb the antiviral gene expression response.

RNA and DNA were isolated from both regions. Expression of ten genes (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, Esr1, Esr2, Avp, Ar, Oxt, Otr, and Bdnf) presumably altered by early-life BPA/EE exposure was examined. Three genes (Bdnf, Dnmt3b, and Esr1) were studied for DNA methylation changes in their putative 5' promoter regions. Molecular changes in hippocampus were correlated to prior Barnes maze performance, including sniffing correct holes, distance traveled, and velocity. Exposure to BPA and/or EE disrupted patterns of sexually dimorphic gene expression/promoter DNA methylation observed in hippocampus and hypothalamus of controls. In the hippocampus of female offspring, BPA exposure resulted in hypermethylation of the putative 5' promoter region of Bdnf, while EE exposure induced hypomethylation. Bdnf methylation was weakly associated with Bdnf expression in hippocampi of female rats. Hippocampal Bdnf expression in females showed a weak negative association with sniffing correct hole in Barnes maze.

Ongoing prospective preconception cohort of women and men seeking fertility evaluation between 2005 and 2016 in a large fertility center in an academic hospital in Boston, MA, USA. We examined the association between maternal and paternal preconception, as well as maternal prenatal urinary BPA and BPS concentrations, and size at birth among 346 singletons from couples recruited in the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study using multivariable linear regression. Infant birth weight and head circumference were abstracted from delivery records. Mean preconception and prenatal exposures were estimated by averaging urinary ln-BPA and ln-BPS concentrations in multiple maternal and paternal urine samples collected before pregnancy, and maternal pregnancy samples collected in each trimester. Maternal preconception urinary BPA concentrations were inversely associated with birth weight and head circumference in adjusted models: each ln-unit increase was associated with a decrease in birth weight of 119 g (95% CI: -212, -27), and a head circumference decrease of 0.72 cm (95% CI: -1.3, -0.1). Additional adjustment by gestational age or prenatal BPA exposure modestly attenuated results. Women with higher prenatal BPA concentrations had infants with lower mean birth weight (-75 g, 95% CI: -153, 2) although this did not achieve statistical significance. Paternal preconception urinary BPA concentrations were not associated with either birth weight or head circumference. No consistent patterns emerged for BPS concentrations measured in either parent.

Heightened public awareness of their potential danger has led to concern about whether EDC and their metabolites have significant negative biological effects. Studies have shown that EDC like DDT and other organochlorine pesticides, such as methoxychlor (MXC), have adverse effects on immune cells, but no studies have addressed the impact of HPTE, the primary metabolite of MXC. To elucidate the presence and significance of HPTE adverse effects, this study explored the impact of HPTE on a critical window and component of immune system development, embryonic T-cell development. Lesions at this phase of development can lead to lifelong immune dysfunction and increased incidence of immune disease, such as autoimmunity. Embry-onic thymocytes (GD 16-18) from C57BL/6 mice were subjected to an in vitro differentiation culture that mimicked early steps in thymocyte development in the presence of 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, or 50 μM HPTE, or a model endocrine disruptor, DES. The results indicated that compared to the vehicle control, HPTE- and DES-induced death of thymocytes. Annexin-V staining and Caspase 8, markers of programed cell death, revealed that the loss of cells was due at least in part to induction of apoptosis. Moreover, HPTE-induced cell death not only resulted in selective loss of double positive thymocytes, but also loss of developing CD4 intermediate cells (post-double positive partially differentiated thymocyte population). Phenotypic analysis of thymocyte maturation (T-cell receptor, TCR) and TCR ligation (CD5) surface markers revealed that surviving embryonic thymocytes expressed low levels of both. Taken together these data demonstrate that immature embryonic thymocytes are sensitive to HPTE exposure and that HPTE exposure targets thymocyte populations undergoing critical differentiation steps. These findings suggest HPTE may play a pivotal role in MXC exposure-induced immune dysfunction.",PMC6120686

Sex was correlated with 8 EDCs including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) ( p < 0.05). Shared household explained 43% and 41% of the total variance for PFASs and blood metals, respectively, but less than 20% for the remaining 11 EDC classes.

Previously, we identified 2 novel plasticizers, 1,4-butanediol dibenzoate (BDB) and dioctyl succinate (DOS), as potential substitutes for DEHP that did not reproduce classically described endocrine disrupting phenotypes in prepubertal male offspring after maternal exposure. Here, we investigated the consequences of in utero and lactational exposure to BDB and DOS on adult male rat reproductive function in a comparative study with DEHP and a commercially available alternative plasticizer, 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH).

Reductions in F1 parental behaviors might also be due to decreased emissions of F2 pup vocalizations. Thus, vocalizations of F2 male and female California mice pups born to F1 parents developmentally exposed to BPA, EE, or controls were examined. Postnatal days (PND) 2-4 were considered early postnatal period, PND 7 and 14 were defined as mid-postnatal period, and PND 21 and 28 were classified as late postnatal period.

In mid-postnatal period, F2 BPA and EE pups emitted greater number of phrases than F2 control pups. Results indicate aspects of vocalizations were disrupted in F2 pups born to F1 parents developmentally exposed to BPA or EE, but their responses were not always identical, suggesting BPA might not activate estrogen receptors to the same extent as EE.

Here, we studied how BPA exposure around implantation affects pregnancy, particularly concentrating on placentation and uterine remodeling. We exposed pregnant female mice to 50 µg/kg BPA/day or 0.1% ethanol by oral gavage from day 1 to 7 of gestation. High frequency ultrasound was employed to document the presence and size of implantations, placentas and fetuses throughout pregnancy. Blood velocity in the arteria uterina was analyzed by Doppler measurements. The progeny of mothers exposed to BPA was growth-restricted compared to the controls; this was evident in vivo as early as at day 12 as analyzed by ultrasound and confirmed by diminished fetal and placenta weights observed after sacrificing the animals at day 14 of gestation. The remodeling of uterine spiral arteries (SAs) was considerably impaired. We show that short-term exposure to a so-called ""safe"" BPA dose around implantation has severe consequences. The intrauterine growth restriction observed in more than half of the fetuses from BPA-treated mothers may owe to the direct negative effect of BPA on the remodeling of uterine SAs that limits the blood supply to the fetus.

The 3 generations analyzed in this study were the participants (F1 generation), their mothers (F0 generation), and their live-born children (F2 generation). Participant- and mother-reported exposure to diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy and physician-diagnosed child ADHD. The total number of women included in this study was 47 540. Of the 47 540 F0 mothers, 861 (1.8%) used diethylstilbestrol and 46 679 (98.2%) did not while pregnant with the F1 participants. Use of diethylstylbestrol by F0 mothers was associated with an increased risk of ADHD among the F2 generation: 7.7% vs 5.2%, adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.36 (95% CI, 1.10-1.67) and an OR of 1.63 (95% CI, 1.18-2.25) if diethylstilbestrol was taken during the first trimester of pregnancy. No effect modification was observed by the F2 children's sex. This study provides evidence that diethylstilbestrol exposure is associated with multigenerational neurodevelopmental deficits. The doses and potency level of environmental endocrine disruptors to which humans are exposed are lower than those of diethylstilbestrol, but the prevalence of such exposure and the possibility of cumulative action are potentially high and thus warrant consideration.",PMC6137513

Early life exposure to some EDCs, including TCDD, is linked to the occurrence of adult-onset and multigenerational disease. Previous work exposing juvenile F0 zebrafish (Danio rerio) to 50 ppt (parts per trillion) TCDD during reproductive development has shown male-mediated transgenerational decreases in fertility (F0-F2) and histologic and transcriptomic alterations in F0 testes. Here, we analyzed male germline alterations in F1 and F2 adult fish, looking for changes in testicular histology and gene expression inherited through the male lineage that could account for decreased reproductive capacity. Testes of TCDD-lineage F1 fish displayed an increase in spermatogonia (immature germ cells) and decrease in spermatozoa (mature germ cells). No histological changes were present in F2 fish. Transcriptomic analysis of exposed F1 and F2 testes revealed alterations in lipid and glucose metabolism, oxidation, xenobiotic response, and sperm cell development and maintenance genes, all of which are implicated in fertility outcomes. Overall, we found that differential expression of reproductive genes and reduced capacity of sperm cells to mature could account for the reproductive defects previously seen in TCDD-exposed male zebrafish and their descendants, providing insight into the distinct multigenerational effects of toxicant exposure.",PMC6061693

However, the underlying mechanisms driving these changes are not well understood. We investigated the molecular perturbations associated with EDC-induced behavioral changes in first (F1) and second (F2) filial generations, using the model EDC bisphenol A (BPA). C57BL/6J dams were exposed to BPA from preconception until lactation through the diet at doses (10 μg/kg bw/d-lower dose or 10 mg/kg bw/d-upper dose) representative of human exposure levels. As adults, F1 male offspring exhibited increased depressive-like behavior, measured by the forced swim test, while females were unaffected. These behavioral changes were limited to the F1 generation and were not associated with altered maternal care. Transcriptome analysis by RNA-sequencing in F1 control and upper dose BPA-exposed adult male hippocampus revealed neurotransmitter systems as major pathways disrupted by developmental BPA exposure. High performance liquid chromatography demonstrated a male-specific reduction in hippocampal serotonin. Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (20 mg/kg bw) rescued the depressive-like phenotype in males exposed to lower, but not upper, dose BPA, suggesting distinct mechanisms of action for each exposure dose. Finally, high resolution mass spectrometry revealed reduced circulating levels of the neuroactive steroid dehydroepiandrosterone in BPA-exposed males, suggesting another potential mechanism underlying the depressive-like phenotype. Thus, behavioral changes associated with early life BPA exposure may be mediated by sex-specific disruptions in the serotonergic system and/or sex steroid biogenesis in male offspring.",PMC6261494

However, few studies have examined potential estrogenicity of soy protein isolate as opposed to that of pure isoflavones. In this study, we fed weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats a semi-purified diet with casein or soy protein isolate as the sole protein source from postnatal day 21 to 33. Additional groups were fed casein or soy protein isolate and treated s.c. with 10 µg/kg/d estradiol via osmotic minipump. Estradiol treatment reduced testis, prostate weights, and serum androgen concentrations ( P < 0.05). Soy protein isolate had no effect. Estradiol up-regulated 489 and down-regulated 1237 testicular genes >1.5-fold ( P < 0.05). In contrast, soy protein isolate only significantly up-regulated expression of 162 genes and down-regulated 16 genes. The top 30 soy protein isolate-up-regulated genes shared 93% concordance with estradiol up-regulated genes. There was little overlap between soy protein isolate down-regulated genes and those down-regulated by estradiol treatment. Functional annotation analysis revealed significant differences in testicular biological processes affected by estradiol or soy protein isolate. Estradiol had major actions on genes involved in reproductive processes including down-regulation of testicular steroid synthesis and expression of steroid receptor activated receptor (Star) and cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/(Cyp17a1). In contrast, soy protein isolate primarily affected pathways associated with macromolecule modifications including ubiquitination and histone methylation. Our results indicate that rather than acting as a weak estrogen in the developing testis, soy protein isolate appears to act as a selective estrogen receptor modulator with little effect on reproductive processes. Impact statement Soy protein isolate (SPI) is the sole protein used to make soy-based infant formulas. SPI contains phytoestrogens, which are structurally similar to estradiol. These phytoestrogens, daidzein, genistein, and equol, fit the definition of endocrine-disrupting compounds, and at high concentrations, have estrogenic actions resulting in reproductive toxicity in the developing male, when provided as isolated chemicals. However, few animal studies have examined the potential estrogenicity of SPI as opposed to pure isoflavones. In this study, SPI feeding did not elicit an estrogenic response in the testis nor any adverse outcomes including reduced testicular growth, or androgen production during early development in rats when compared to those receiving estradiol. These findings are consistent with emerging data showing no differences in reproductive development in males and female children that received breast milk, cow's milk formula, or soy infant formula during the postnatal feeding period.",PMC6378512

Intergenerational effects were investigated in the liver of 1-year old female offspring (F1). During gestation, sows were orally exposed to two low doses and a high dose of E2 (0.05, 10, and 1000 µg/kg body weight/day). In F0, perturbed tissue specific mRNA expression of cell cycle regulation and tumour suppressor genes was found at low and high dose exposure, being most pronounced in the endometrium and corpus luteum. The liver showed the most significant DNA hypomethylation in three target genes; CDKN2D, PSAT1, and RASSF1. For CDKN2D and PSAT1, differential methylation in blastocysts was similar as observed in the F0 liver. Whereas blastocysts showed hypomethylation, the liver of 1-year old offspring showed subtle, but significant hypermethylation.

The causes of spontaneous PTB are poorly understood; however, recent studies suggest that this condition may arise as a consequence of the parental fetal environment. Specifically, we previously demonstrated that developmental exposure of male mice (F1 animals) to the environmental endocrine disruptor 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was associated with reduced sperm quantity/quality in adulthood and control female partners frequently delivered preterm. Reproductive defects persisted in the F2 and F3 descendants, and spontaneous PTB was common. Reproductive changes in the F3 males, the first generation without direct TCDD exposure, suggest the occurrence of epigenetic alterations in the sperm, which have the potential to impact placental development. Herein, we conducted an epigenetic microarray analysis of control and F1 male-derived placentae, which identified 2171 differentially methylated regions, including the progesterone receptor (Pgr) and insulin-like growth factor (Igf2). To assess if Pgr and Igf2 DNA methylation changes were present in sperm and persist in future generations, we assessed methylation and expression of these genes in F1/F3 sperm and F3-derived placentae. Although alterations in methylation and gene expression were observed, in most tissues, only Pgr reached statistical significance. Despite the modest gene expression changes in Igf2, offspring of F1 and F3 males consistently exhibited IUGR. Taken together, our data indicate that paternal developmental TCDD exposure is associated with transgenerational placental dysfunction, suggesting epigenetic modifications within the sperm have occurred. An evaluation of additional genes and alternative epigenetic mechanisms is warranted.",PMC6203877

Especially the prenatal and early postnatal period is highly vulnerable to adverse effects by environmental exposure, promoting developmental reprogramming by epigenetic alterations. To obtain a deeper insight into the role of prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure in children's overweight development, we combine epidemiological data with experimental models and BPA-dependent DNA methylation changes. BPA concentrations were measured in maternal urine samples of the LINA mother-child-study obtained during pregnancy (n = 552), and BPA-associated changes in cord blood DNA methylation were analyzed by Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays (n = 472). Methylation changes were verified by targeted MassARRAY analyses, assessed for their functional translation by qPCR and correlated with children's body mass index (BMI) z scores at the age of 1 and 6 years. Further, female BALB/c mice were exposed to BPA from 1 week before mating until delivery, and weight development of their pups was monitored (n ≥ 8/group). Additionally, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells were treated with BPA during the adipocyte differentiation period and assessed for exposure-related epigenetic, transcriptional and morphological changes (n = 4). In prenatally BPA-exposed children two CpG sites with deviating cord blood DNA-methylation profiles were identified, among them a hypo-methylated CpG in the promoter of the obesity-associated mesoderm-specific transcript (MEST). A mediator analysis suggested that prenatal BPA exposure was connected to cord blood MEST promoter methylation and MEST expression as well as BMI z scores in early infancy. This effect could be confirmed in mice in which prenatal BPA exposure altered Mest promoter methylation and transcription with a concomitant increase in the body weight of the juvenile offspring. An experimental model of in vitro differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells also revealed an epigenetically induced MEST expression and enhanced adipogenesis following BPA exposure. Our study provides evidence that MEST mediates the impact of prenatal BPA exposure on long-term body weight development in offspring by triggering adipocyte differentiation.",PMC5910578

A notable knowledge gap is their impact on development and function of the immune system. Herein, we report an investigation of whether developmental exposure to a mixture of chemicals associated with UOG operations affects the development and function of the immune system. We used a previously characterized mixture of 23 chemicals associated with UOG, and which was demonstrated to affect reproductive and developmental endpoints in mice. C57Bl/6 mice were maintained throughout pregnancy and during lactation on water containing two concentrations of this 23-chemical mixture, and the immune system of male and female adult offspring was assessed. We comprehensively examined the cellularity of primary and secondary immune organs, and used three different disease models to probe potential immune effects: house dust mite-induced allergic airway disease, influenza A virus infection, and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In all three disease models, developmental exposure altered frequencies of certain T cell sub-populations in female, but not male, offspring. Additionally, in the EAE model disease onset occurred earlier and was more severe in females. Our findings indicate that developmental exposure to this mixture had persistent immunological effects that differed by sex, and exacerbated responses in an experimental model of autoimmune encephalitis. These observations suggest that developmental exposure to complex mixtures of water contaminants, such as those derived from UOG operations, could contribute to immune dysregulation and disease later in life.",PMC5974794

Maternal-fetal signaling is mediated in part by signaling molecules (eg, microRNAs [miRNAs]) contained in extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are released by the placenta into the maternal circulation. We investigated whether maternal exposure to the EDCs phthalates and personal care products alters the miRNA profile of placental-derived EVs circulating in maternal blood. Blood and urine samples from pregnant women with uncomplicated term dichorionic, diamniotic twin pregnancies were analyzed as part of a larger study investigating correlations between exposure of phthalate and personal care products and epigenetic alterations in twin pregnancies. We explored correlations between maternal urinary levels of 13 phthalate and 12 personal care products metabolites and the miRNA profile of placental EVs (EV-miRNAs) circulating in maternal blood. The expression of miR-518e was highest among women with high urinary levels of monobenzyl phthalate and methyl paraben. miR-373-3p was the least expressed in women exposed to high levels of methyl paraben, and miR-543 was significantly downregulated in women exposed to high levels of paraben metabolites, dichlorophenol metabolites, and triclosan.

This study applied a more complex behavioral apparatus, an X-shaped Plexiglas apparatus (FourPlex), that enabled an experimental animal exposed to PCBs or a vehicle to distinguish and choose among 4 stimulus animals of the same or opposite sex, and of different hormonal status. We found that rats were able to differentiate among the stimuli in the FourPlex and showed the expected preference for an opposite sex, hormone-treated rat, particularly for behaviors conducted in proximity. Prenatal treatment caused subtle shifts in behavior toward stimulus rats in the FourPlex; more robust effects were seen for the sexual dimorphisms in behavior. Importantly, the results differ from our previous results of a simple binary choice model, showing that how an animal behaves in a more complex social paradigm does not predict the outcome in a simple choice model, and vice versa.

PCBs were used primarily for industrial applications due to their insulating and fire retardant properties, but were banned in the 1970s in the United States and in the 1980s in the United Kingdom, as adverse health effects following exposure were identified. Previous studies of populations with high PCB exposure have reported inverse associations with birth weight and gestational length. Birth weight is a powerful predictor of infant survival, and low birth weight can predispose infants to chronic conditions in adult life such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we investigated the association between prenatal exposure to PCBs and fetal growth in a sample of 448 mother-daughter dyads. Concentrations of three common PCB analytes, PCB-118, PCB-153 and PCB-187, were measured in maternal serum collected during pregnancy, and fetal growth was measured by birth weight and birth length. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the associations between PCB analytes and measures of fetal growth, after adjusting for parity, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, educational status, tobacco use and gestational age of infant at sample collection. Birth length, ponderal index and gestational age were not associated with any of the PCB analytes. Mothers' educational status modified associations for PCB analytes with birthweight. We observed significant inverse associations with birth weight only among daughters of mothers with less education. Daughter's birth weight was -138.4 g lower (95% CI: -218.0, -58.9) for each 10 ng/g lipid increase in maternal serum PCB-118. Similarly, every 10 ng/g lipid increase in maternal serum PCB-153 was associated with a -41.9 g (95% CI: -71.6, -12.2) lower birth weight. Every 10 ng/g lipids increase in maternal serum PCB-187, was associated with a -170.4 g (95% CI: -306.1, -34.7) lower birth weight, among girls with mothers in the lowest education group.

We determined epigenome-wide DNA methylation marks (Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850k BeadChip) and gene expression (Agilent whole human genome array) associated with phthalate exposure in first trimester placenta. Integrative genomic analysis of candidate genes was performed to define gene methylation-expression relationships. We identified 39 genes with significantly altered methylation and gene expression in the high phthalate exposure group. Most of these relationships were inversely correlated. This analysis identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a critical candidate gene mediating the effects of phthalates on early placental function.

The synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) are exogenous EDs whereas the estrogenic hormone 17β-estradiol is a natural endogenous ED. Although the biological effects of these individual EDs have partially been studied previously, their toxicity when acting in combination has not yet been investigated. Here we treated Wistar rats with BaP, EE2 and estradiol alone or in combination and studied the influence of EE2 and estradiol on: (i) the expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 and 1B1 in rat liver on the transcriptional and translational levels; (ii) the inducibility of these CYP enzymes by BaP in this rat organ; (iii) the formation of BaP-DNA adducts in rat liver in vivo; and (iv) the generation of BaP-induced DNA adducts after activation of BaP with hepatic microsomes of rats exposed to BaP, EE2 and estradiol and with recombinant rat CYP1A1 in vitro. BaP acted as a strong and moderate inducer of CYP1A1 and 1B1 in rat liver, respectively, whereas EE2 or estradiol alone had no effect on the expression of these enzymes. However, when EE2 was administered to rats together with BaP, it significantly decreased the potency of BaP to induce CYP1A1 and 1B1 gene expression. For EE2, but not estradiol, this also correlated with a reduction of BaP-induced CYP1A1 enzyme activity in rat hepatic microsomes. Further, while EE2 and estradiol did not form covalent adducts with DNA, they affected BaP-derived DNA adduct formations in vivo and in vitro. The observed decrease in BaP-DNA adduct levels in rat liver in vivo resulted from the inhibition of CYP1A1-mediated BaP bioactivation by EE2 and estradiol. Our results indicate that BaP genotoxicity mediated through its activation by CYP1A1 in rats in vivo is modulated by estradiol and its synthetic derivative EE2.",PMC6593260

Identifying and characterizing toxic hazards based on the manner by which adverse effects are produced rather than on the nature of those adverse effects departs from traditional practice and requires a proper interpretation of the evidence regarding the chemical's ability to produce physiological effect(s) via a specific mode of action (MoA). The ability of any chemical to produce a physiological effect depends on its pharmacokinetics and the potency by which it acts via the various MoAs that can lead to the particular effect. A chemical's potency for a specific MoA-its mechanistic potency-is determined by two properties: (1) its affinity for the functional components that comprise the MoA, i.e., its specific receptors, enzymes, transporters, transcriptional elements, etc., and (2) its ability to alter the functional state of those components (activity). Using the agonist MoA via estrogen receptor alpha, we illustrate an empirical method for determining a human-relevant potency threshold (HRPT), defined as the minimum level of mechanistic potency necessary for a chemical to be able to act via a particular MoA in humans. One important use for an HRPT is to distinguish between chemicals that may be capable of, versus those likely to be incapable of, producing adverse effects in humans via the specified MoA. The method involves comparing chemicals that have different ERα agonist potencies with the ability of those chemicals to produce ERα-mediated agonist responses in human clinical trials. Based on this approach, we propose an HRPT for ERα agonism of 1E-04 relative to the potency of the endogenous estrogenic hormone 17β-estradiol or the pharmaceutical estrogen, 17α-ethinylestradiol.

We seek to determine the relationship between several known endocrine disrupting compounds and a marker of ovarian responsivity, the FSH:LH ratio (higher ratio indicates less ovarian responsivity). For this analysis, 169 naturally cycling women between 21 and 38 years of age completed interviews and had their blood drawn on day 3 of their menstrual cycle for analyses of toxicants, gonadal sex hormones (E2 and P4), and gonadotropins (FSH and LH). PCB congeners were classified into five groups based on their environmental persistence, distribution in human tissue, and toxicological action, reflecting the structure, mechanism, and known biological activity of individual PCB congeners. For every unit (ppb) increase in the level of the estrogenic PCB group, there was a 5-fold greater risk of a FSH:LH ratio ≥ 2, controlling for individual differences in age, percent body fat, cycle day 3 estradiol levels, parity, alcohol use and cigarette smoking in the past year (exp[ß] = 5; p = ≤0.01). PCB congeners identified as estrogenic were analyzed individually, and, of the 19 potentially estrogenic congeners, five were significantly, and positively related to an increased FSH:LH ratio. Four of these congeners are non-persistent, easily volatilize in the environment, and are easily metabolized, and hence, are indicative of very recent or current exposure. p,p'-DDE and HCB were not associated with FSH:LH ratio. We find a clinical indicator of ovarian responsivity, FSH:LH ratio, is associated with a specific group of estrogenic PCBs. These congeners may become airborne when they volatilize from dredged PCB-contaminated soil or from indoor PCB-containing window caulk and sealants in older buildings leading to inhalation exposure.

In a prospective cohort study, we investigated whether maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and phthalate mixtures measured during pregnancy were associated with thyroid hormones among pregnant women and newborns. We measured nine phthalate metabolites [monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and four monoesthers of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] in urine collected at approximately 16 and 26 weeks' gestation among women in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study (2003-2006, Cincinnati, Ohio). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free and total thyroxine and triiodothyronine were measured in maternal serum at 16 weeks' gestation (n = 202) and cord serum at delivery (n = 276). We used multivariable linear regression to assess associations between individual urinary phthalate metabolites and concentrations of maternal or cord serum thyroid hormones. We used weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) to create a phthalate index describing combined concentrations of phthalate metabolites and to investigate associations of the phthalate index with individual thyroid hormones. With each 10-fold increase in 16-week maternal urinary MEP, maternal serum total thyroxine (TT4) decreased by 0.52 μg/dL (95% CI: -1.01, -0.03). For each 10-fold increase in average (16- and 26-week) maternal urinary MBzP, cord serum TSH decreased by 19% (95% CI: -33.1, -1.9). Among mothers, the phthalate index was inversely associated with maternal serum TT4 (WQS beta = -0.60; 95% CI: -1.01, -0.18). Among newborns, the phthalate index was inversely associated with both cord serum TSH (WQS beta = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.20, -0.03) and TT4 (WQS beta = -0.53; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.16). Our results suggest that co-exposure to multiple phthalates was inversely associated with certain thyroid hormones (TT4 in pregnant women and newborns, and TSH in newborns) in this birth cohort.

NCTR Sprague Dawley rat dams were gavaged from gestational day (GD) 6 until parturition, and their pups were directly gavaged daily from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 90 with BPA (2.5, 25, 250, 2500, 25,000, 250,000 μg/kg/d) or vehicle control. At PND 90, the testes and sperm were collected for evaluation. The testes were histologically evaluated for altered germ cell apoptosis, sperm production, and altered spermiation. RNA and DNA isolated from sperm were assessed for elicited changes in global mRNA transcript abundance and altered DNA methylation. Effects of BPA were observed in changes in body, testis and epididymis weights only at the highest administered dose of BPA of 250,000 μg/kg/d. Genome-wide transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses failed to detect robust alterations in sperm mRNA and DNA methylation levels. These data indicate that prolonged exposure starting in utero to BPA over a wide range of levels has little, if any, impact on the testes and sperm molecular profiles of 90 day old rats as assessed by the histopathologic, morphometric, and molecular endpoints evaluated.",PMC6412024

We have previously reported that exposure of C. elegans embryos to low doses of different bisphenols decreases fecundity. In addition, we have shown that the effects of exposure during the very early stages of development persist into adulthood as assayed by quantifying habituation behavior, a form of non-associative learning.

The discovery and development of photoconvertible proteins have greatly aided our understanding of these dynamic changes by providing a method to optically highlight cells and tissues. However, while photoconversion, time-lapse microscopy, and subsequent image analysis have proven to be very successful in uncovering cellular dynamics in organs such as the brain or the eye, this approach is generally not used in the developing heart due to challenges posed by the rapid movement of the heart during the cardiac cycle. This protocol consists of two parts. The first part describes a method for photoconverting and subsequently tracking endocardial cells (EdCs) during zebrafish atrioventricular canal (AVC) and atrioventricular heart valve development. The method involves temporally stopping the heart with a drug in order for accurate photoconversion to take place. Hearts are allowed to resume beating upon removal of the drug and embryonic development continues normally until the heart is stopped again for high-resolution imaging of photoconverted EdCs at a later developmental time point. The second part of the protocol describes an image analysis method to quantify the length of a photoconverted or non-photoconverted region in the AVC in young embryos by mapping the fluorescent signal from the three-dimensional structure onto a two-dimensional map. Together, the two parts of the protocol allows one to examine the origin and behavior of cells that make up the zebrafish AVC and atrioventricular heart valve, and can potentially be applied for studying mutants, morphants, or embryos that have been treated with reagents that disrupt AVC and/or valve development.",PMC5931328

However, the effects of emerging bisphenolic compounds, such as bisphenol S (BPS), on placental function remain untested. The aim was to determine if bisphenol A (BPA) or BPS, at an environmentally relevant dose, impairs placental function. Pregnant sheep were randomly distributed into three treatment groups (n = 7-8/group): control, BPA, and BPS. All animals received daily injections of corn oil (control), BPA, or BPS (0.5 mg/kg; s.c.; internal fetal doses were ~ 2.6 ng/mL unconjugated BPA and ~ 7.7 ng/mL of BPS) from gestational day 30-100. After a 20-day washout period, placentas were weighed and placentomes collected. Placental endocrine function was assessed on biweekly maternal blood samples.

However, for routine toxicity assessment of, for example, water samples, current EDA approaches are considered time-consuming and laborious. We achieved faster EDA and identification by downscaling of sensitive cell-based hormone reporter gene assays and increasing fractionation resolution to allow testing of smaller fractions with reduced complexity. The high-resolution EDA approach is demonstrated by analysis of four environmental passive sampler extracts. Downscaling of the assays to a 384-well format allowed analysis of 64 fractions in triplicate (or 192 fractions without technical replicates) without affecting sensitivity compared to the standard 96-well format. Through a parallel exposure method, agonistic and antagonistic androgen and estrogen receptor activity could be measured in a single experiment following a single fractionation. From 16 selected candidate compounds, identified through nontargeted analysis, 13 could be confirmed chemically and 10 were found to be biologically active, of which the most potent nonsteroidal estrogens were identified as oxybenzone and piperine. The increased fractionation resolution and the higher throughput that downscaling provides allow for future application in routine high-resolution screening of large numbers of samples in order to accelerate identification of (emerging) endocrine disruptors.",PMC5947935

Second generation pups sired by affected males exhibited decreased neonatal body weight but only when dam was unexposed. Offspring from M2 treatments, B6 dams, 8nrCG sires or additional mutant lines were not similarly affected.

However, few epidemiologic studies have examined the influence of EDCs on measures of inflammation and cellular aging during pregnancy and postpartum. We investigated associations between prenatal exposures to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PBDE metabolites (OH-PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and per- and polyfluorochemicals (PFASs) with repeated biomarker measurements of inflammation and cellular aging in women during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Overweight or obese pregnant women were recruited from the San Francisco Bay area (n = 103) during their first or second trimester of pregnancy. Blood samples were collected from participants at baseline (median 16 weeks gestation) and at three and nine months postpartum. Serum concentrations of PBDEs, OH-PBDEs, PCBs, and PFASs were measured at baseline. Inflammation biomarkers (interleukin 6 [IL-6], interleukin 10 [IL-10], and tumor necrosis factor [TNF-α]) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a biomarker of cellular aging, were measured at all three time points. Associations between serum chemical concentrations and repeated measures of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and LTL were examined using linear mixed models. We also examined the potential for effect modification by time (visit) and obesity. In adjusted models, we observed positive relationships between PBDEs and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). A doubling in ∑PBDEs was associated with a 15.26% (95% CI 1.24, 31.22) and 3.74% (95% CI -0.19, 7.82) increase in IL-6 and TNF-α, respectively.

Identifying toxicoepigenetic mechanisms of developmental exposure-induced effects for EDCs, such as phthalates or bisphenol A (BPA), is essential. Here, we investigate whether maternal exposure to EDCs is predictive of infant DNA methylation at candidate gene regions. In the Michigan Mother-Infant Pairs (MMIP) cohort, DNA was extracted from cord blood leukocytes for methylation analysis by pyrosequencing (n = 116) and methylation changes related to first trimester levels of 9 phthalate metabolites and BPA. Growth and metabolism-related genes selected for methylation analysis included imprinted (IGF2, H19) and non-imprinted (PPARA, ESR1) genes along with LINE-1 repetitive elements. Findings revealed decreases in methylation of LINE-1, IGF2, and PPARA with increasing phthalate concentrations. For example, a log unit increase in ΣDEHP corresponded to a 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.83, -0.22] percentage point decrease in PPARA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation were also inversely correlated with PPARA gene expression determined by RT-qPCR (r = -0.34, P = 0.02), thereby providing evidence in support of functional relevance. A sex-stratified analysis of EDCs and DNA methylation showed that some relationships were female-specific. For example, urinary BPA exposure was associated with a 1.35 (95%CI: -2.69, -0.01) percentage point decrease in IGF2 methylation and a 1.22 (95%CI: -2.27, -0.16) percentage point decrease in PPARA methylation in females only.

Assessment of serum thyroxine (T4) demonstrated a significant dose-dependent decrease by TCS (50 or 200 mg/kg/day) co-administered with TP and TCS (200 mg/kg) without TP, but no differences in liver or thyroid weights. In the H295R assay, TCS from 0.01 to 10 μM had no effect on testosterone production but TCS at 3 μM and above did induce a significant increase in estrogen production. At 10 μM, TCS produced significant cytotoxicity which confounded the interpretation of the estrogenic effect at that concentration.

Data on measures of ovarian reserve, as indicated by serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B (INHB) levels, were retrieved retrospectively through electronic medical charts. Multivariate linear models were performed to estimate the associations of urinary phthalate metabolites and serum AMH and INHB. We further explored the potential nonlinearity of the relationships with restricted cubic spline analysis. Overall, we found largely null associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and serum AMH.

Previous studies demonstrated that developmental exposure to the weakly estrogenic PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221) in Sprague-Dawley rats altered sexual development, adult reproductive physiology and body weight. The current study tested the hypothesis that prenatal A1221 exposure not only disrupts these endpoints within an exposed individual's (F1 generation) lifespan, but may also affect subsequent generations (F2-F3). We treated pregnant female rats on embryonic days (E) 16 and E18 with A1221 (1 mg/kg), estradiol benzoate (50 μg/kg, positive estrogenic control), or vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil, negative control). Endpoints related to sexually dimorphic developmental trajectories of reproductive and developmental physiology were measured, and as adults, reproductive endocrine status was assessed, in the F1, F2, and F3 generations. Significant effects of transgenerational EDCs were found for body weight and serum hormones. The A1221 descendants had significantly higher body weight in the F2-maternal lineage throughout postnatal development, and in F3-maternal lineage animals after weaning. In females, generation- and lineage-specific effects of exposure were found for serum progesterone and estradiol. Specifically, serum progesterone concentrations were lower in F2-A1221 females, and higher in F3-A1221 females, compared to their respective F2- and F3-vehicle counterparts. Serum estradiol concentrations were higher in F3-A1221 than F3-vehicle females. Reproductive and adrenal organ weights, birth outcomes, sex ratio, and estrous cycles, were unaffected. It is notable that effects of A1221 were only sometimes mirrored by the estrogenic control, EB, indicating that the mechanism of action of A1221 was likely via non-estrogenic pathways. PCBs caused body weight and hormonal effects in rats that were not observed in the directly exposed F1 offspring, but emerged in F2 and F3 generations. Furthermore, most effects were in the maternal lineage; this may relate to the timing of exposure of the F1 fetuses at E16 and 18, when germline (the future F2 generation) epigenetic changes diverge in the sexes. These results showing transgenerational effects of EDCs have implications for humans, as we are now in the 3rd generation since the Chemical Revolution of the mid-twentieth century, and even banned chemicals such as PCBs have a persistent imprint on the health of our descendants.",PMC5819226

In contrast, mice exposed to NP at 5 μg/kg/day emitted an increased number and duration of ultrasonic vocalizations, took longer to reach ejaculation and showed increased number of mounts, intromissions and thrusts. This was associated with normal olfactory preference and locomotor activity, and increased anxiety level. Analysis of the neural circuitry that underlies sexual behavior showed changes in the number of cells expressing androgen and estrogen receptors in males exposed to NP at 5 μg/kg/day. The neural circuitry underlying sexual behavior is thus highly sensitive to adult exposure to NP. Furthermore, almost all the observed effects were induced at 5 μg/kg/day of NP, indicating that this endocrine disrupter triggers a non-monotonic response in the adult male mouse brain.",PMC5813014

Cox regression with discrete-time was used to estimate fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each chemical to estimate the probability of pregnancy. While most EDCs were detected in seminal plasma, concentrations were lower than urinary concentrations previously analyzed for the cohort. None of the EDCs were significantly associated with fecundability even after covariate adjustment, though benzophenones consistently yielded FORs <1.0 (ranging from 0.72 to 0.91) in couple-adjusted models suggestive of diminished fecundity (longer TTP). The findings underscore that a range of EDCs can be quantified in seminal plasma, but the lower concentrations may require a large cohort for assessing couple fecundability, as well as the need to consider other fecundity outcomes such as semen quality.",PMC5878734

Two previous studies examined mice exposed during early development to a 23-chemical mixture of UOG compounds (UOG-MIX) commonly used or produced in the process. Both male and female offspring exposed prenatally to one or more doses of UOG-MIX displayed alterations to endocrine organ function and serum hormone concentrations. We hypothesized that prenatal UOG-MIX exposure would similarly disrupt development of the mouse mammary gland. Female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to ~3, ~30, ~ 300, or ~3000 μg/kg/d UOG-MIX from gestational day 11 to birth. Although no effects were observed on the mammary glands of these females before puberty, in early adulthood, females exposed to 300 or 3000 μg/kg/d UOG-MIX developed more dense mammary epithelial ducts; females exposed to 3 μg/kg/d UOG-MIX had an altered ratio of apoptosis to proliferation in the mammary epithelium. Furthermore, adult females from all UOG-MIX-treated groups developed intraductal hyperplasia that resembled terminal end buds (i.e., highly proliferative structures typically seen at puberty). These results suggest that the mammary gland is sensitive to mixtures of chemicals used in UOG production at exposure levels that are environmentally relevant. The effect of these findings on the long-term health of the mammary gland, including its lactational capacity and its risk of cancer, should be evaluated in future studies.",PMC5809159

In this study, we report that early life exposure in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos to 6-OH-BDE-47 (50 and 100 nM) resulted in higher coiling frequency and significantly increased apoptotic cells in the brain. These effects were partially rescued by overexpression of thyroid hormone receptor β (THRβ) mRNA. Moreover, exposure to 100 nM 6-OH-BDE-47 significantly reduced the number of hypothalamic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin)-immunoreactive (5-HT-ir) neurons and the mRNA expression of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2). These results indicate that 6-OH-BDE-47 affected thyroid hormone regulation through THRβ and negatively impacted the nervous system, in turn, affecting coiling behavior. Correlations of these endpoints suggest that coiling frequency could be used as an indicator of neurotoxicity in embryos.",PMC7006228

Recent studies have reported alarming levels of NP, as the final metabolite of NPEOs, in Vietnamese urban waters, whilst response to this issue is negligible. With the aim of addressing how the public perceives and expects to avoid the risk of endocrine disrupting surfactants (EDSs), the study tested the hypothesized roles of specific knowledge, general knowledge, and perceived uncertainty using structural equation modelling. The findings revealed that different types of knowledge played certain roles in explaining risk perception, risk acceptability, and self-protective response, which are distinguished by experience amongst the public. Evidence of the mediating role that perceived uncertainty may play in the decrease of risk perception and the increase of risk unacceptance has been provided. The insights gained from the study may help answer why the public are in favor of taking non-diet-related self-protective measures rather than changing their dietary habits, which illustrates a comparison with the basis of health belief model. The needs for building cognitive capacity amongst the public, particularly pregnant women and young mothers, and risk communication concerning endocrine disrupting contamination linked to reproductive health are highlighted.",PMC5858365

We measured urinary concentrations of 15 phthalate metabolites and 11 phenols in 446 pregnant women enrolled in the Healthy Start pre-birth cohort. Creatinine-adjusted geometric means (GM) for each urinary biomarker were compared across categories of potential sociodemographic and dietary predictors. To assess the independent relationship between each significant food group predictor and biomarker we used multivariable models, adjusted for sociodemographic predictors. The phthalate metabolites with the highest concentrations were monoethyl phthalate (GM: 41.1µg/g creatinine) and monocarboxyisooctyl phthalate (GM: 20.5µg/g creatinine). Benzophenone-3 (GM: 124.6µg/g creatinine) and methyl paraben (GM: 119.9µg/g creatinine) were the phenols with the highest concentrations. Concentrations of the metabolites of di-n-butyl phthalate and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were significantly higher in younger, unmarried or unemployed mothers, those who were overweight or obese, those with lower educational attainment, or those of minority race/ethnicity (p-values < 0.05). Metabolites of di-n-butyl phthalate concentrations were 18% lower in those who consumed milk ≥ 7 times per week (95% CI: 30-4%).

We sought to explore the association between maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and lncRNA expression in human placenta to better understand potential mechanisms through which lncRNAs participate in mediating phthalate toxicity. Ten patients with uncomplicated dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies at term were included in this study. Urinary (n = 10) and placenta samples (n = 20) were collected for all participants. Urinary samples were analyzed for 15 phthalate metabolites and 2 phthalate alternative metabolites. Real-time PCR arrays were used to identify and quantify 87 lncRNAs from the placental samples. We tested the Spearman correlation matrix to compare prenatal phthalate measures against placental lncRNA levels. lncRNA levels showed large variations across samples, with no significant differences in lncRNA expression within twin pairs. Mono-(carboxynonyl) phthalate demonstrated consistently strong correlations with most lncRNAs. The strongest correlation was observed between mono-hydroxyisobutyl phthalate and LOC91450 (Rspearman = 0.88, p < .001). This correlation remained significant after Bonferroni adjustment.

Moreover, not only the efficiency of treatment must be considered but also toxicological aspects. Taking into account all these aspects, the main goal of the study was to investigate the photochemical decomposition of hazardous phenolic compounds under simulated as well as natural sunlight from the toxicity point of view. The studies were focused on photodegradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol as well as mixture of phenol, 2-chlorophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol. Photosensitized oxidation process was carried out in homogeneous and heterogeneous system. V. fischeri luminescence inhibition was used to determine the changes of toxicity in mixture during simulated and natural irradiation. The photodegradation was carried out in three kinds of water matrix; moreover, the influence of presence of inorganic matter on the treatment process was investigated. The experiments with natural sunlight proved applicability of photosensitive chitosan for visible-light water pollutant degradation.

BPA is used in various food-contacting materials and is easily eluted into food; as a result, we are exposed to BPA on a daily basis. In adults, BPA is metabolized and eliminated rapidly from the body. However, numerous reports suggest that fetuses and young children are susceptible to BPA. One of the concerning adverse effects of BPA is disruption of behavior, especially anxiety-like behavior. In order to study the mechanism of influences on offspring, it is important to clarify the most vulnerable gestation period. We hypothesized that offspring in late pregnancy would be more susceptible to BPA, because late pregnancy is a critical time for functional brain development. In this study, C57BL/6 mouse fetuses were exposed prenatally by oral dosing of pregnant dams, once daily from gestational day 5.5 to 12.5 (early pregnancy) or 11.5 to 18.5 (late pregnancy), with BPA (0 or 10 mg/kg body weight). Following birth and weaning, the resulting pups were tested using an elevated plus maze at postnatal week 10.

Estrogenic ligands include both natural and manmade ""Environmental Estrogens"" (EEs) found in many consumer goods including Personal Care Products (PCPs), plastics, pesticides, and foods. EEs disrupt hormone signaling in humans and other animals, potentially reducing fertility and increasing disease risk. Despite the importance of EEs and other Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) to public health, endocrine disruption is not typically included in undergraduate curricula. This shortcoming is partly due to a lack of relevant laboratory activities that illustrate the principles involved while also being accessible to undergraduate students. This article presents an optimized YES for quantifying ligands in personal care products that bind estrogen receptors alpha (ERα) and/or beta (ERβ). The method incorporates one of the two colorimetric substrates (ortho-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) or chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG)) that are cleaved by β-galactosidase, a 6-day refrigerated incubation step to facilitate use in undergraduate laboratory courses, an automated application for LacZ calculations, and R code for the associated 4-parameter logistic regression analysis. The protocol has been designed to allow undergraduate students to develop and conduct experiments in which they screen products of their choosing for estrogen mimics. In the process, they learn about endocrine disruption, cell culture, receptor binding, enzyme activity, genetic engineering, statistics, and experimental design. Simultaneously, they also practice fundamental and broadly applicable laboratory skills, such as: calculating concentrations; making solutions; demonstrating sterile technique; serially diluting standards; constructing and interpolating standard curves; identifying variables and controls; collecting, organizing, and analyzing data; constructing and interpreting graphs; and using common laboratory equipment such as micropipettors and spectrophotometers.

Our previous rodent research has identified that prenatal stress (PS) modulates neurotoxicity of two endocrine active metals (EAMs), Pb and MeHg, by altering HPA and CNS systems disrupting behavior. Here, we review this research and further test the hypothesis that prenatal stress modulates metals neurotoxicity by expanding to test the effect of developmental As ± PS exposure. Serum corticosterone and behavior was assessed in offspring of dams exposed to As ± PS. PS increased female offspring serum corticosterone at birth, while developmental As exposure decreased adult serum corticosterone in both sexes. As + PS induced reductions in locomotor activity in females and reduced response rates on a Fixed Interval schedule of reinforcement in males, with the latter suggesting unique learning deficits only in the combined exposure. As-exposed males showed increased time in the open arms of an elevated plus maze and decreased novel object recognition whereas females did not. These data further confirm the hypothesis that combined exposure to chemical (EAMs) and non-chemical (PS) stressors results in enhanced neurobehavioral toxicity.

The aim of this study was to investigate how BPS (in a wide range of doses, including very low doses) affects granulosa cell and theca cell steroid hormone production and cell viability in the bovine. Granulosa cell oestradiol production was stimulated when cells were exposed to 100 μM BPS under basal conditions, but there was no effect of BPS when cells were stimulated with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Additionally, there was no effect of BPS on granulosa cell progesterone production or cell viability under basal or FSH-stimulated conditions. BPS did not affect theca cell androstenedione or progesterone production, or theca cell viability under basal or luteinizing hormone-stimulated conditions.

Because environmental contaminants, endocrine disruption, and pathogens often figure prominently in amphibian declines it is imperative that we understand how these factors are potentially interrelated to affect montane populations. One possibility is that increased precipitation associated with global warming promotes the deposition of contaminants in montane regions. Increased exposure to contaminants, in turn, potentially elicits chronic elevations in circulating stress hormones that could contribute to montane population declines by compromising resistance to pathogens and/or production of sex steroids regulating reproduction. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining contaminant levels, stress and sex steroid levels, and nematode abundances in male drab treefrogs, Smilisca sordida, from lowland and montane populations in Costa Rica. We found no evidence that montane populations were more likely to possess contaminants (i.e., organochlorine, organophosphate and carbamate pesticides or benzidine and chlorophenoxy herbicides) than lowland populations. We also found no evidence of elevational differences in circulating levels of the stress hormone corticosterone, estradiol or progesterone. However, montane populations possessed lower androgen levels, hosted more nematode species, and had higher nematode abundances than lowland populations. Although these results suggested that nematodes contributed to lower androgens in montane populations, we were unable to detect a significant inverse relationship between nematode abundance and androgen level. Our results suggest that montane populations of this species are not at greater risk of exposure to contaminants or chronic stress, but implicate nematodes and compromised sex steroid levels as potential threats to montane populations.",PMC5764372

Here, we use a rat model of human prenatal exposure to investigate the potential interactive effects of an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates and a maternal high-fat diet (HFD). From gestation through postnatal day (P)10, dams consumed the mixture of phthalates (0, 200, or 1000 μg/kg/d) and were fed a control diet or HFD. In males, perinatal exposure to the mixture of phthalates decreased prepubertal body weight and, in a dose-specific manner, periadolescent social play behavior. A dose-specific effect from phthalates with HFD was also seen in increased time alone in females during social play. HFD resulted in dams consuming more calories, having greater gestational weight gain, and licking and nursing their pups more, such that an early postnatal HFD generally increased pup body weight. There also was a tendency for increased oxidative stress markers at P10 within the medial prefrontal cortex of males exposed to the relatively high dose of phthalates and HFD. Effects on gene expression were inconsistent at P10 and P90 in both the medial prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus. Overall, this study demonstrates that phthalates and a maternal HFD only rarely interacted, except in oxidative stress markers in males. Additionally, perinatal exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates can have a modest, but lasting, impact on social behaviors in both males and females.",PMC5793791

The plant seems to present potent endocrine disrupting effects, and its excretion and disposal are not a concern. The effects of Ruta graveolens L. (Rutaceae) ethanol extract (RE) on reproductive behaviour, fertility, and steroid and thyroid hormone levels in zebrafish were investigated. We exposed subjects to varying concentrations of RE, and one-tenth the LC50 concentration (2.37 ppm) was established as the sublethal dose. After 2 weeks exposure, reproductive behaviour, cumulative number of eggs laid, percentage of fertilized eggs, and whole body steroid and thyroid hormones were measured. Reproductive association behaviour did not differ between control and RE-exposed animals, but spawning attempts were reduced in RE exposed animals. Cumulative egg production between days 9 to 14, RE exposed fish laid 672 eggs while control fish laid 1242 eggs. Also, percentage of fertilized eggs was higher for the control than for the RE exposed fish. Estradiol-17β (E2) levels were reduced in females exposed to RE and testosterone (T) was statistically lower in both males and females treated with RE. Furthermore, thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) declined in fish treated with RE. RE has endocrine disrupting potential in fish, which has important implications for studying the effects of unintentional pharmaceutical exposure. Moreover, the results demonstrate that drug exposure may affect more than just the overall level of behaviour, emphasizing the relevance of examining the effects of individual exposure. We reinforce the use of zebrafish as a model organism in physiology and behaviour, and raise concerns about the toxic effects of RE in non-target organisms such as aquatic vertebrates, which may ultimately affect human health.",PMC6130722

In vitro high-throughput screening (HTS) assays are needed to evaluate risk to testosterone production, yet the main steroidogenesis assay currently utilized is a human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, H295R, which does not synthesize gonadal steroids at the same level as the gonads, thus limiting assay sensitivity. Here, we propose a complementary assay using a highly purified rat Leydig cell assay to evaluate the potential for chemical-induced alterations in testosterone production by the testis. We evaluated a subset of chemicals that failed to decrease testosterone production in the HTS H295R assay. The chemicals examined fit into one of two categories based on changes in substrates upstream of testosterone in the adrenal steroidogenic pathway (17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone) that we predicted should have elicited a decrease in testosterone production. We found that 85% of 20 test chemicals examined inhibited Leydig cell testosterone production in our assay. Importantly, we adopted a 96-well format to increase throughput and efficiency of the Leydig cell assay. We identified a selection criterion based on the AC50 values for 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone generated from the HTS H295R assay that will help prioritize chemicals for further testing in the Leydig cell screen. We hypothesize that the greater dynamic range of testosterone production and sensitivity of the Leydig cell assay permits the detection of small, yet significant, chemical-induced changes not detected by the HTS H295R assay.",PMC6691738

However, how these two EDCs would affect prepubertal Sertoli cells development was rarely studied. In this study, primary prepubertal Sertoli cells were isolated from 22-day-old Sprague Dawley rats and exposed to MEHP at 1 μmol/L, 10 μmol/L, and 100 μmol/L (M1, M10, and M100), genistein at 10 μmol/L (G), and their combination (G + M1, G + M10, and G + M100). Cell proliferation inhibition rate, apoptosis and necrosis rate, and cellular redox state were evaluated. Our results revealed that MEHP could significantly increase cell proliferation inhibition rate, apoptosis rate, necrosis rate, and intracellular reactive oxidative species level. However, coadministration of genistein could partially alleviate MEHP-induced prepubertal Sertoli cells oxidative injuries via enhancement of testicular antioxidative enzymes activities and upregulation of Nrf2 and HO-1, indicating that genistein could partially attenuate MEHP-induced prepubertal Sertoli cells damage through antioxidative action and may have promising future on its curative role for attenuating other EDCs-induced reproductive disorders.",PMC5702931

Although DEHP is a known endocrine disruptor, little is known about the effects of DEHP exposure on female reproduction. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that prenatal DEHP exposure affects follicle numbers, estrous cyclicity, and hormone levels in multiple generations of mice. Pregnant CD-1 mice were orally dosed with corn oil (vehicle control) or DEHP (20 and 200 µg/kg/d and 500 and 750 mg/kg/d) from gestational day 11 until birth. The F1 females were mated with untreated males to create the F2 generation, and the F2 females were mated with untreated males to create the F3 generation. At 1 year, ovaries, hormones, and estrous cycles were analyzed in each generation. Prenatal DEHP exposure altered estrous cyclicity (750 mg/kg/d), increased the presence of ovarian cysts (750 mg/kg/d), and decreased total follicle numbers (750 mg/kg/d) in the F1 generation. It also decreased anogenital distance (200 µg/kg/d) and altered follicle numbers (200 µg/kg/d and 500 mg/kg/d) in the F2 generation, and it altered estrous cyclicity (20 and 200 µg/kg/d and 500 and 750 mg/kg/d) and decreased folliculogenesis (200 µg/kg/d and 500 mg/kg/d) in the F3 generation. Further, prenatal DEHP increased estradiol levels (F1 and F3), decreased testosterone levels (F1, F2, and F3), decreased progesterone levels (F2), altered gonadotropin hormone levels (F1 and F3), and decreased inhibin B levels (F1 and F3).

We previously showed that exposure of mouse fetuses to bisphenol A (BPA) caused adult-onset obesity. To examine roles of epigenetic changes in this delayed toxicity, we determined the effects of fetal mouse exposure to BPA on genome-wide DNA methylation and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in gonadal white adipose tissues (WATs) by deep sequencing, bisulfite pyrosequencing, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Pregnant CD-1 mice (F0) were dosed daily with 0, 5, or 500 μg/kg/d BPA during gestational days 9 to 18, and the weaned F1 animals were fed ad libitum with standard chow until they were euthanized at 19 weeks old. In the vehicle-exposed F1 animals, fggy promoter showed a clear bimodal pattern of very strong (55% to 95%) or very weak (5% to 30%) DNA methylation occurring at nearly equal incidence with no intermediate strength. Promoter hypermethylation completely suppressed mRNA expression. BPA exposure eliminated this naturally occurring dichotomy, shifting fggy promoter toward the hypomethylation state to release transcriptional suppression. The strength of Fggy mRNA expression significantly correlated with increased whole body weight and gonadal fat weight of males but not females. Bioinformatics studies showed that expression of Fggy mRNA is stronger in mouse WATs than in brown adipose tissues and enhanced in gonadal fat by diet-induced obesity. These observations suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA may disrupt the physiological bimodal nature of epigenetic regulation of fggy in mouse WATs, possibly contributing to the adult-onset obesity phenotype.",PMC5774244

Recently, a high-throughput H295R (HT-H295R) assay was developed as part of the ToxCast program that includes measurement of 11 hormones, including progestagens, corticosteroids, androgens, and estrogens. To date, 2012 chemicals have been screened at 1 concentration; of these, 656 chemicals have been screened in concentration-response. The objectives of this work were to: (1) develop an integrated analysis of chemical-mediated effects on steroidogenesis in the HT-H295R assay and (2) evaluate whether the HT-H295R assay predicts estrogen and androgen production specifically via comparison with the OECD-validated H295R assay. To support application of HT-H295R assay data to weight-of-evidence and prioritization tasks, a single numeric value based on Mahalanobis distances was computed for 654 chemicals to indicate the magnitude of effects on the synthesis of 11 hormones. The maximum mean Mahalanobis distance (maxmMd) values were high for strong modulators (prochloraz, mifepristone) and lower for moderate modulators (atrazine, molinate). Twenty-five of 28 reference chemicals used for OECD validation were screened in the HT-H295R assay, and produced qualitatively similar results, with accuracies of 0.90/0.75 and 0.81/0.91 for increased/decreased testosterone and estradiol production, respectively. The HT-H295R assay provides robust information regarding estrogen and androgen production, as well as additional hormones.

RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and subsequent data analyses revealed 50 differentially regulated genes in the brains of F3 juveniles from BPA vs control lineages. BPA exposure can lead to loss of imprinting, and one of the two imprinted genes in our data set, maternally expressed gene 3 (Meg3), has been associated with EDCs and neurobehavioral phenotypes. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine the two imprinted genes in our data set, Meg3 and microRNA-containing gene Mirg (residing in the same loci). Confirming the RNA-seq, Meg3 messenger RNA was higher in F3 brains from the BPA lineage than in control brains. This was true in brains from mice produced with two different BPA paradigms.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We recently demonstrated that perinatal BPA exposure is associated with higher body fat, impaired glucose tolerance, and reduced insulin secretion in first- (F1) and second-generation (F2) C57BL/6J male mice offspring. We sought to determine the multigenerational effects of maternal bisphenol A exposure on mouse pancreatic islets. Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these persistent changes were determined in F1 and F2 adult offspring of F0 mothers exposed to two relevant human exposure levels of BPA (10μg/kg/d-LowerB and 10mg/kg/d-UpperB). Both doses of BPA significantly impaired insulin secretion in male but not female F1 and F2 offspring. Surprisingly, LowerB and UpperB induced islet inflammation in male F1 offspring that persisted into the next generation. We also observed dose-specific effects of BPA on islets in males. UpperB exposure impaired mitochondrial function, whereas LowerB exposure significantly reduced β-cell mass and increased β-cell death that persisted in the F2 generation. Transcriptome analyses supported these physiologic findings and there were significant dose-specific changes in the expression of genes regulating inflammation and mitochondrial function. Previously we observed increased expression of the critically important β-cell gene, Igf2 in whole F1 embryos. Surprisingly, increased Igf2 expression persisted in the islets of male F1 and F2 offspring and was associated with altered DNA methylation. These findings demonstrate that maternal BPA exposure has dose- and sex-specific effects on pancreatic islets of adult F1 and F2 mice offspring. The transmission of these changes across multiple generations may involve either mitochondrial dysfunction and/or epigenetic modifications. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1674.",PMC5915189

The OCT-based assay includes metrics that quantify organoid intracellular kinetic energy and cross-sectional area (CSA). We compare the results to those obtained using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) mitochondrial dye conversion assay. Both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF7) and ER-negative (MCF10DCIS.com) breast cell lines were studied, beginning one hour after exposure and continuing for several days. Six days of exposure to 17β-estradiol or the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen respectively increased or decreased MCF7 organoid CSA (p < .01), consistent with the role of estrogen signaling in ER-positive mammary epithelial cell proliferation.

One such pollutant, arsenic, contaminates the drinking water of ~100 million people globally and has been associated with insulin resistance and diabetes in epidemiological studies. Despite these observations, the precise metabolic derangements induced by arsenic remain incompletely characterized. In the present study, the impact of arsenic on in vivo metabolic physiology was examined in 8-wk-old male C57BL/6J mice exposed to 50 mg/l inorganic arsenite in their drinking water for 8 wk. Glucose metabolism was assessed via in vivo metabolic testing, and feeding behavior was analyzed using indirect calorimetry in metabolic cages. Pancreatic islet composition was assessed via immunofluorescence microscopy. Arsenic-exposed mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance compared with controls; however, no difference in peripheral insulin resistance was noted between groups. Instead, early insulin release during glucose challenge was attenuated relative to the rise in glycemia. Despite decreased insulin secretion, pancreatic β-cell mass was not altered, suggesting that arsenic primarily disrupts β-cell function. Finally, metabolic cage analyses revealed that arsenic exposure induced novel alterations in the diurnal rhythm of food intake and energy metabolism. Taken together, these data suggest that arsenic exposure impairs glucose tolerance through functional impairments in insulin secretion from β-cells rather than by augmenting peripheral insulin resistance.

We assessed several components of maternal behavior including nesting behavior and pup retrieval; characterized the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)α in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a brain region critical for the display of maternal behavior; and measured expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for dopaminergic cells, in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain region important in maternal motivation. We found that developmental exposure to EE2 induces subtle effects on several aspects of maternal behavior including time building the nest and time spent engaged in self-care. Developmental exposure to EE2 also altered ERα expression in the central MPOA during both early and late lactation and led to significantly reduced tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the VTA.

The murine pituitary gland has two critical windows of development: embryonic gland establishment and neonatal hormone cell expansion. During embryonic development, one environmentally ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), has been shown to alter pituitary development by increasing proliferation and gonadotrope number in females but not males. However, the effects of exposure during the neonatal period have not been examined. Therefore, we dosed pups from postnatal day (PND)0 to PND7 with 0.05, 0.5, and 50 μg/kg/d BPA, environmentally relevant doses, or 50 μg/kg/d estradiol (E2). Mice were collected after dosing at PND7 and at 5 weeks. Dosing mice neonatally with BPA caused sex-specific gene expression changes distinct from those observed with embryonic exposure. At PND7, pituitary Pit1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was decreased with BPA 0.05 and 0.5 μg/kg/d in males only. Expression of Pomc mRNA was decreased at 0.5 μg/kg/d BPA in males and at 0.5 and 50 μg/kg/d BPA in females. Similarly, E2 decreased Pomc mRNA in both males and females. However, no noticeable corresponding changes were found in protein expression. Both E2 and BPA suppressed Pomc mRNA in pituitary organ cultures; this repression appeared to be mediated by estrogen receptor-α and estrogen receptor-β in females and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor in males, as determined by estrogen receptor subtype-selective agonists. These data demonstrated that BPA exposure during neonatal pituitary development has unique sex-specific effects on gene expression and that Pomc repression in males and females can occur through different mechanisms.",PMC5761589

These structures demonstrated robust cellularity, appropriate architecture and abundant Ki-67 expression. Expression patterns of cytokeratins 6, 7 and 10, uroplakin and the androgen receptor in xenografted specimens demonstrated characteristic male/female differences analogous to non-grafted specimens. DHT treatment reliably produced tubularization of nascent urethral and vestibular structures and male patterns of androgen receptor expression in grafts of both genetic sexes while estrogenic or hormonally absent conditions reliably resulted in a persistent open urethral/vestibular groove and female patterns of androgen receptor expression.

The first 48 couples provided a spot urine sample on the same day as semen sample procurement. Sperm DNA methylation was assessed with the HumanMethylation 450 K array. Seventeen urinary phthalate and 1,2-Cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH) metabolite concentrations were measured from spot urine samples. The A-clust algorithm was employed to identify co-regulated regions. DMRs associated with urinary metabolite concentrations were identified via linear models, corrected for false discovery rate (FDR). Adjusting for age, BMI, and current smoking, 131 DMRs were associated with at least one urinary metabolite. Most sperm DMRs were associated with anti-androgenic metabolites, including mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, n = 83), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP, n = 16), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP, n = 22) and cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-monocarboxy isooctyl (MCOCH, n = 7). The DMRs were enriched in lincRNAs as well as in regions near coding regions. Functional analyses of DMRs revealed enrichment of genes related to growth and development as well as cellular function and maintenance. Finally, 13% of sperm DMRs were inversely associated with high quality blastocyst-stage embryos after IVF. Our modest sample size only included 48 males and additional larger studies are necessary to confirm our observed results. Non-differential misclassification of exposure is also a concern given the single spot urine collection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that preconception urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations are associated with sperm DNA methylation in humans. These results suggest that paternal adult environmental conditions may influence epigenetic reprogramming during spermatogenesis, and in turn, influence early-life development.

The biochar samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), elemental analysis and BET surface area measurements. The influences of pyrolysis temperature, E2 concentration, pH, ionic strength, background electrolyte and humic acid were studied. Kinetic and isotherm results illustrated that the adsorption process could be well described by pseudo-second-order and Freundlich models. Experimental results showed that ionic strength had less influence on the adsorption of E2 by 500 and 600 °C rice straw biochar. Further, multivalent ions had positive impact on E2 removal than monovalent ions and the influence of the pyrolysis temperature was unremarkable when background electrolyte existed in solutions. The adsorption capacity of E2 decreased with the pH ranged from 3.0 to 12.0 and the humic acid concentration from 2 to 10 mg L-1. Electrostatic attractions and π-π interaction were involved in the adsorption mechanisms. Compared to low-temperature biochar, high-temperature biochar exhibited a better adsorption capacity for E2 in aqueous solution, indicated it had a greater potential for E2 pollution control.",PMC5664714

Environmental chemicals have been linked to TH disruption, yet the relationship between developmental exposures and decline in serum TH resulting in neurodevelopmental impairment is poorly understood. The present study developed a quantitative adverse outcome pathway where serum thyroxin (T4) reduction following inhibition of thyroperoxidase in the thyroid gland are described and related to deficits in fetal brain TH and the development of a brain malformation, cortical heterotopia. Pregnant rats were exposed to 6-propylthiouracil (PTU 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, or 3 parts per million [ppm]) from gestational days 6-20, sequentially increasing PTU concentrations in maternal thyroid gland and serum as well as in fetal serum. Dams exposed to 0.5 ppm PTU and higher exhibited dose-dependent decreases in thyroidal T4. Serum T4 levels in the dam were significantly decreased with exposure to 2 and 3 ppm PTU. In the fetus, T4 decrements were first observed at a lower dose of 0.5 ppm PTU. Based on these data, fetal brain T4 levels were estimated from published literature sources, and quantitatively linked to increases in the size of the heterotopia present in the brains of offspring. These data show the potential of in vivo assessments and computational descriptions of biologic responses to predict the development of this structural brain malformation and use of quantitative adverse outcome pathway approach to evaluate brain deficits that may result from exposure to other TH disruptors.",PMC10623382

Ovaries were collected for histological and gene expression analyses and sera were collected for hormone assays. In utero BPA exposure decreased preantral follicle numbers, cytochrome P450 aromatase mRNA levels, and estradiol levels in the F1 generation, whereas it decreased testosterone levels and altered steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1, and cytochrome P450 aromatase mRNA levels in the F2 generation.

To address the behavioral impact of developmental exposure to BPA, we tested offspring of mice exposed to a daily low dose of BPA during pregnancy. We also asked if preconception exposure of the sire affected behaviors in offspring. Sires that consumed BPA for 50days prior to mating weighed less than controls, but no effects on any reproductive measures were noted. Juvenile offspring exposed to BPA maternally, but not paternally, spent less time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze than controls, indicating increased anxiety-like behavior. However, neither parental exposure group differed significantly from controls in the social recognition task. We also assessed the behaviors of maternally exposed offspring in two novel tasks: ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in pups and operant reversal learning in adults. Maternal BPA exposure increased the duration and median frequency of USVs emitted by pups during maternal separation. In the reversal learning task, females responded more accurately and earned more rewards than males.

However, the amount of EDC uptake into the animal is often difficult to determine. Using radiolabeled estradiol ([3H]E2), we previously developed a rapid, straightforward assay to measure estradiol uptake from water into zebrafish embryos and larvae. Here, we extend this approach to measure the uptake of two additional EDCs, bisphenol A (BPA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE2). As with E2, the uptake of each compound by individual larvae was low (<6%), and increased with increasing concentration, duration, and developmental stage. We found that E2 and EE2 had similar uptake under equivalent exposure conditions, while BPA had comparatively lower uptake. One application of this assay is to test factors that influence EDC uptake or efflux. It has been suggested that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) inhibit ABC transporters that may normally efflux EDCs and their metabolites, inducing toxicity in aquatic organisms. We measured [3H]E2 levels in zebrafish in the presence or absence of the POP PDBE-100, and cyclosporine A, a known inhibitor of ABC transporters. Neither chemical significantly affected [3H]E2 levels in zebrafish, suggesting that zebrafish maintain estradiol efflux in the presence of PDBE-100, independently of cyclosporine A-responsive transporters. These uptake results will be a valuable reference for EDC exposure studies in developing zebrafish, and provide a rapid assay to screen for chemicals that influence estrogen-like EDC levels in vivo.",PMC5862746

We quantified 11 phthalate metabolites and nine phenols (four parabens, benzophenone-3, BPA, two dichlorophenols, triclosan) in spot urine samples collected during pregnancy among EDEN cohort mothers who delivered a boy. Mothers completed the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when their children were 3.1 (n=529) and 5.6 (n=464) y old. BPA was positively associated with the relationship problems subscale at 3 y [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.20] and the hyperactivity-inattention subscale scores at 5 y (IRR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.14).

We investigated the relationships between repeated measures of urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA and circulating total 25(OH)D in a prospective cohort of pregnant women. The present study population includes participants (n=477) in a nested case-control study of preterm birth drawn from a prospective birth cohort of pregnant women at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Urine and blood samples were collected for biomarker measurements at median 10 wk and 26 wk of gestation. In repeated measures analysis, we observed that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in urinary mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) was associated with a 4.48% decrease [95% confidence interval (CI): -7.37, -1.58] in total 25(OH)D. We also detected inverse associations for metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) [percent difference (%Δ)=-2.83 to -2.16]. For BPA, we observed a nonsignificant inverse association with total 25(OH)D in the overall population. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that the associations for some metabolites (e.g., MEHP) varied by race/ethnicity, which may reflect potential differences in susceptibility. In agreement with findings from repeated measures analysis, we reported that DEHP metabolites and BPA were significantly associated with an approximate 20% increase in the odds of vitamin D deficiency (≤20 ng/mL) [odds ratio (95% CI): 1.19 (1.06, 1.35) for molar sum of DEHP metabolites and 1.22 (1.01, 1.47) for BPA] at median 10 wk and 26 wk, respectively.

Although several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain NMDR relationships, they are largely undemonstrated. Using mouse pancreatic β-cells from wild-type and oestrogen receptor ERβ-/- mice, we found that exposure to increasing doses of BPA affected Ca2+ entry in an NMDR manner. Low doses decreased plasma membrane Ca2+ currents after downregulation of Cav2.3 ion channel expression, in a process involving ERβ. High doses decreased Ca2+ currents through an ERβ-mediated mechanism and simultaneously increased Ca2+ currents via oestrogen receptor ERα.

The current studies were conducted as part of the CLARITY-BPA (Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity) program and tested the hypothesis that perinatal BPA exposure would induce morphological changes in hormone sensitive, sexually dimorphic brain regions. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups: BPA (2.5, 25, or 2500μg/kgbw/day), a reference estrogen (0.5μg ethinylestradiol (EE2)/kgbw/day), or vehicle. Exposure occurred by gavage to the dam from gestational day 6 until parturition, and then to the offspring from birth through weaning. Unbiased stereology was used to quantify the volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN), the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), the posterodorsal portion of the medial amygdala (MePD), and the locus coeruleus (LC) at postnatal day 28. No appreciable effects of BPA were observed on the volume of the SDN or LC. However, AVPV volume was enlarged in both sexes, even at levels below the FDA NOAEL.

We explored, through mathematical modeling and simulations, the size of potential effects of random mixtures of aromatase inhibitors on the dynamics of women's menstrual cycles. We simulated random exposures to millions of potential mixtures of 86 aromatase inhibitors. A pharmacokinetic model of intake and disposition of the chemicals predicted their internal concentration as a function of time (up to 2 y). A ToxCast™ aromatase assay provided concentration-inhibition relationships for each chemical. The resulting total aromatase inhibition was input to a mathematical model of the hormonal hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian control of ovulation in women. Above 10% inhibition of estradiol synthesis by aromatase inhibitors, noticeable (eventually reversible) effects on ovulation were predicted. Exposures to individual chemicals never led to such effects. In our best estimate, ∼10% of the combined exposures simulated had mild to catastrophic impacts on ovulation. A lower bound on that figure, obtained using an optimistic exposure scenario, was 0.3%. These results demonstrate the possibility to predict large-scale mixture effects for endocrine disrupters with a predictive toxicology approach that is suitable for high-throughput ranking and risk assessment.

In secondary analyses, we evaluated estimated exposure at the midpoint of the first trimester and rates of change in exposure across pregnancy in relation to outcomes. Several phthalate metabolites measured throughout in utero development were associated with higher serum testosterone concentrations, while a number of metabolites measured in the third trimester were associated with higher DHEA-S. For example, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in mean monoethyl phthalate (MEP) levels across pregnancy was associated with 44% higher peripubertal testosterone (95% CI: 13-83%), while an IQR increase in di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP) specifically in the third trimester was associated with 25% higher DHEA-S (95%CI: 4.7-47%). In IQR increase in mean mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) levels across pregnancy was associated with lower odds of having a Tanner Stage >1 for breast development (OR = 0.32, 95%CI: 0.11-0.95), while MEHP in the third trimester was associated with higher odds of having a Tanner Stage >1 for pubic hair development (OR = 3.76, 95%CI: 1.1-12.8). Results from secondary analyses were consistent with findings from our main analysis. These findings suggest that female reproductive development may be more vulnerable to the effects of phthalate or BPA exposure during specific critical periods of in utero development. This highlights the need for comprehensive characterizations of in utero exposure and consideration of windows of susceptibility in developmental epidemiological studies. Future research should consider repeated measures of in utero phthalate and BPA exposure within each trimester and across pregnancy.",PMC5623649

Suppression of androgen synthesis in fetal life has been associated with testis maldescent, malformations of the genitalia at birth, and poor semen quality later in life. Our aim was to investigate whether chemicals can act together to disrupt androgen production in human fetal testis explants and to evaluate the importance of mixture effects when characterizing the hazard of individual chemicals. We used an organotypic culture system of human fetal testes explants called FEtal Gonad Assay (FEGA) with tissue obtained at 10 and 12 gestational wk (GW 10-12), to screen 27 chemicals individually for their possible anti-androgenic effect. Based on the results of the screen, we selected 11 compounds and tested them as mixtures. We evaluated mixtures composed of four and eight antiandrogens that contained the pharmaceuticals ketoconazole and theophylline and several previously untested chemicals, such as the pesticides imazalil and propiconazole. Mixtures of antiandrogens can suppress testosterone synthesis in human fetal testicular explants to an extent greater than that seen with individual chemicals. This revealed itself as a shift towards lower doses in the dose-response curves of individual antiandrogens that became more pronounced as the number of components increased from four to eight. Our results with the FEGA provide the foundations of a predictive human mixture risk assessment approach for anti-androgenic exposures in fetal life. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1014.",PMC5783658

We explored windows of vulnerability to BPA exposure in a multiethnic cohort of 228 mothers and their children from Cincinnati, Ohio. We measured urinary BPA concentrations at up to two prenatal and six postnatal time points from the 2nd trimester of pregnancy until the child was age 8years. At age 8years, we administered the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in composite scores from each instrument using a multiple informant model designed to identify heightened windows of vulnerability. Among all children, there was not strong evidence that the associations between BPA and neurobehavior varied by the timing of exposure (Visit x BPA p-values≥0.16). However, child sex modified the associations of repeated BPA measures with BASC-2 scores (Visit x Sex x BPA p-values=0.02-0.23).

First we showed that pyrimethanil induces underdevelopment of ovaries and interferes with normal sexual differentiation, thus revealing the endocrine disruption potential of this fungicide. Moreover we revealed that all considered organs are seriously affected by this fungicide and both necrosis and apoptosis contribute to the histological response.

The presence of TOs is often assumed to imply exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs); however, a definitive causal relationship has yet to be established, and TO prevalence is not consistently low in fish from areas lacking evident EDC sources. This might indicate any of a number of situations: 1) unknown or unidentified EDCs or EDC sources, 2) induction of TOs by other stressors, or 3) testicular oocytes occurring spontaneously during normal development. In the present study, we analyzed TO occurrence in smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) from 8 populations in northeastern Minnesota watersheds with differing degrees of human development and, hence, presumed likelihood of exposure to anthropogenic chemicals. Three watersheds were categorized as moderately developed, based on the presence of municipal wastewater discharges and higher human population density (4-81 per km2 ), and 5 watersheds were minimally developed, with very low human population density (0-1 per km2 ) and minimal built environment. Testicular tissues from mature fish were evaluated using a semiquantitative method that estimated TO density, normalized by cross-sectional area. Testicular oocyte prevalence and density among populations from moderately developed watersheds was higher than in populations from minimally developed watersheds. However, TO prevalence was unexpectedly high and variable (7-43%) in some populations from minimally developed watersheds, and only weak evidence was found for a relationship between TO density and watershed development, suggesting alternative or more complex explanations for TO presence in smallmouth bass from this region.

Exposure during early gestation, a critical period for reproductive development, is of particular concern. Anogenital distance (AGD) is a sensitive biomarker of the fetal hormonal milieu and a measure of reproductive toxicity in animal models. In some studies, the daughters of BPA-exposed dams have shorter AGD than controls. Here, we investigate this relationship in humans. BPA was assayed in first-trimester urine samples from 385 participants who delivered infant girls in a multicenter pregnancy cohort study. After birth, daughters underwent exams that included two measures of AGD (AGD-AC: distance from center of anus to clitoris; AGD-AF: distance from center of anus to fourchette). We fit linear regression models to examine the association between specific gravity-adjusted (SPG-adj) maternal BPA concentrations and infant AGD, adjusting for covariates. BPA was detectable in 94% of women. In covariate-adjusted models fit on 381 eligible subjects, the natural logarithm of SpG-adj maternal BPA concentration was inversely associated with infant AGD-AC [β=−0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.97, −0.15]. We observed no association between maternal BPA and infant AGD-AF. BPA may have toxic effects on the female reproductive system in humans, as it does in animal models. Higher first-trimester BPA exposure was associated with significantly shorter AGD in daughters, suggesting that BPA may alter the hormonal environment of the female fetus. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP875.",PMC5744699

Among vertebrate species, the molecular components of TH signaling are highly conserved, including the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), their heterodimer binding partners the retinoid-X receptors (RXRs), and their DNA recognition sequences (TREs). This molecular conservation allows examination of potential TH disruption in the tractable, in vivo model system of amphibian metamorphosis. Metamorphosis requires TH signaling for both instigation and progression, and it provides dramatic and well-characterized phenotypes involving different cell fates. Here we describe a quantitative, precocious-metamorphosis assay suite we developed using one-week post-fertilization (PF) Xenopus laevis tadpoles in order to assess disruption of TH signaling. Tadpoles at this developmental stage (Nieuwkoop-Faber (NF)-48) are competent to respond to TH hormone, although not yet producing TH, along many metamorphic pathways, and they are uniform in size. This allowed us to quantify changes in morphology associated with natural metamorphosis (e.g. gill and tail resorption, brain expansion, and craniofacial remodeling) after five days of treatment. Using the same tadpoles from morphological measurements, we quantified a 20-fold increase in TH-induced cellular proliferation in the rostral head region by whole-mount immunocytochemistry. At the molecular level, we used F3-generation tadpoles from a transgenic X. laevis line, which expresses luciferase under the control of a native TRE, to assess the ability of compounds to disrupt TR function. The luciferase reporter showed over 10-fold activation by physiologic concentrations of TH. We used the synthetic TR antagonist NH-3 to demonstrate the feasibility of our assay suite to measure inhibition of TH activity at the level of the receptor. Finally, we assessed the capabilities of suspected TH-disrupting chemicals tetrabrominated diphenyl ether 47 (BDE-47) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). We found that BDE-47 displays general toxicity rather than TH disruption, as it did not increase brain width nor affect the TRE-luciferase reporter. However, TBBPA, a suspected TR antagonist, although not effective in antagonizing cell proliferation, significantly inhibited the TRE-luciferase reporter, suggesting that it bears closer scrutiny as a TH disruptor. Overall the assay suite has important advantages over the classical tadpole metamorphosis assays with respect to the uniformity of animal size, small test volume, reproducibility, and short test period. The assays are performed before endogenous TH production and free feeding start, which further reduces complexity and variability.",PMC5558850

We measured BPA concentration in urine samples collected at ∼12 wk gestation among women enrolled in a 10-city Canadian cohort study. At approximately 3 y of age, we assessed children’s cognitive abilities with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of IntelligenceTM–III (WPPSI-III) and two scales of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function–Preschool (BRIEF-P). Parents reported children’s behavior using the Behavior Assessment System for Children–2 (BASC-2) and the Social Responsiveness ScaleTM–2 (SRS-2).

Levels of PFAAs in plasma and follicular fluid samples collected from women undergoing ovarian stimulation were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Six PFAAs were detected in both plasma and follicular fluid. PFAA concentrations in plasma correlate strongly to those detected in ovary and, with the exception of one compound, remain stable throughout ovarian stimulation. The concentration of PFHxS in follicular fluid inversely relates to baseline follicle counts. While no significant relationships were detected between ovarian response measures and PFAA concentrations, we identified a negative relationship between follicular fluid PFDA and PFuNA and blastocyst conversion rates.

The objective of this study was to assess trimester-specific in utero phthalate and BPA exposure in relation to measures of reproductive development among peripubertal boys in a Mexico City birth cohort. We measured maternal urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. We measured serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), inhibin B, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and assessed sexual maturation (Tanner staging and testicular volume) among male children at age 8-14 years (n = 109). Linear and logistic regression were used to investigate trimester-specific in utero exposure as predictors of peripubertal hormone levels and sexual maturation, respectively. In sensitivity analyses we evaluated estimated exposure at 7 weeks gestation and rates of change in exposure across pregnancy in relation to outcomes. Exposure to phthalates during the third trimester was associated with reduced odds of having a Tanner stage >1 for pubic hair development (e.g. MBzP OR = 0.18 per interquartile range (IQR) increase; 95% CI:0.03-0.97) and higher peripubertal SHBG levels (e.g. MBzP 15.2%/IQR; 95% CI:3.2-28%), while first and second trimester phthalates were not. In contrast, exposure to DEHP during the first trimester was associated with higher estradiol (11%/IQR; 95% CI:1.5-22%), while second or third trimester DEHP exposure was not.

Eight BDE congeners (BDE-28, -47, -99, -100, -153, -154, -183, -209) were measured by GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) in maternal hair samples collected at the time of recruitment. The ∑PBDE geometric mean for maternal hair was 45.35 pg/mg for controls and 50.27 pg/mg for cases; the concentrations of three BDEs (BDE-99, -100, and -154) were significantly higher in cases than controls in unadjusted models. In adjusted models, every 10-fold increase in the concentration of maternal hair BDE-99 [OR=2.53 (95% CI: 1.29, 4.95) or BDE-100 [OR=2.45 (95% CI: 1.31, 4.56)] was associated with more than a doubling in the risk of cryptorchidism. BDE-154 [OR=1.88 (95% CI: 1.08, 3.28) was also significant. Our results suggest that maternal exposure to BDE-99, -100, and -154 may be associated with abnormal migration of testes in the male fetus. This may be due to the anti-androgenic properties of the PBDEs. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP522.",PMC5726354

We previously showed that dietary exposure to 10 µg/kg body weight (bw)/d and 10 mg/kg bw/d of bisphenol A (BPA) during pregnancy induced metabolic abnormalities in F1 male offspring and gestational glucose intolerance in F0 pregnant mice. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying etiologies of BPA exposure-induced metabolic disease by analyzing the male fetal liver metabolome. Using the Metabolon Discover HD4 Platform, our laboratory identified metabolic pathways that were altered by BPA exposure, including biochemicals in lipid and amino acid metabolism. Specifically, primary and secondary bile acids were increased in liver from BPA-exposed embryonic day 18.5 male fetuses. We subsequently showed that increased bile acid was associated with a defective farnesoid X receptor-dependent negative feedback mechanism in BPA-exposed fetuses. In addition, through metabolomics, we observed that BPA-exposed fetuses had elevated tryptophan levels. Independent liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry measurement revealed that BPA-exposed dams also had increased tryptophan levels relative to those of controls. Because several key enzymes in tryptophan catabolism are vitamin B6 dependent and vitamin B6 deficiencies have been linked to gestational diabetes, we tested the impact of vitamin B6 supplementation and showed that it rescued gestational glucose intolerance in BPA-exposed pregnant mice. Our study has therefore identified two pathways (bile acid and tryptophan metabolism) that potentially underlie BPA-induced maternal and fetal metabolic disease.",PMC5551548

It is generally recognized that phenolic xenobiotics, a group of ubiquitous endocrine disruptors, undergo rapid phase II metabolism to generate more water-soluble glucuronide and sulfate conjugates as a detoxification pathway. However, the toxicological effects of the compounds invariably point to the phase I metabolic cytochrome P450 enzymes. Here we show that phenolic xenobiotics undergo an unknown metabolic pathway to form more lipophilic and bioactive products. In a nontargeted screening of the metabolites of a widely used antibacterial ingredient: triclosan (TCS), we identified a metabolic pathway via in vitro incubation with weever, quail, and human microsomes and in vivo exposure in mice, which generated a group of products: TCS-O-TCS. The lipophilic metabolite of TCS was frequently detected in urine samples from the general population, and TCS-O-TCS activated the constitutive androstane receptor with the binding activity about 7.2 times higher than that of the parent compound. The metabolic pathway was mediated mainly by phase I enzymes localized on the microsomes and widely observed in chlorinated phenols, phenols, and hydroxylated aromatics. The pathway was also present in different phenolic xenobiotics and formed groups of unknown pollutants in organisms (e.g., TCS-O-bisphenol A and TCS-O-benzo(a)pyrene), thus providing a cross-talk reaction between different phenolic pollutants during metabolic processes in organisms.",PMC5468616

To study the effects of environmental endocrine disruptors, embryos and larvae are commonly exposed to supraphysiologic concentrations of these compounds in the water, but their bioavailability in zebrafish is largely unknown. One hypothesis is that supraphysiologic concentrations of estrogens in the water are required to achieve physiologic levels in vivo; however, this has not been directly tested. To test this hypothesis, we developed an assay using radiolabeled estradiol ([3H]E2) to measure uptake from water at multiple concentrations and exposure durations in developing zebrafish from 0 to 5 days postfertilization (dpf). We found that [3H]E2 uptake increased with increasing concentration, duration, and developmental stage. Percent uptake from the total volume of treatment solution increased with increasing exposure duration and developmental stage, but remained constant with increasing concentration. We also found that the chorion, an acellular envelope surrounding embryos through 3 dpf, did not substantially affect [3H]E2 uptake. Finally, we found that at 1 dpf, E2 was preferentially taken up by the yolk at multiple exposure durations, while at 2 dpf E2 was preferentially taken up into the embryonic body. Our results support the hypothesis that exposing zebrafish embryos and larvae to supraphysiologic concentrations of estrogens is required to achieve physiologically relevant doses in vivo. The isotopic assay reported here will provide a foundation for determining the uptake of other compounds for teratogenicity, toxicology and drug discovery studies.",PMC5837308

We previously reported that parabens promoted adipocyte differentiation in vitro and increased adiposity but suppressed serum marker of bone formation in vivo. Here, we investigated the effects of parabens (methylparaben and butylparaben) on modulating cell fate of multipotent stem cell line C3H10T1/2. Both parabens modulated adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells in vitro. Butylparaben markedly promoted adipogenic differentiation, but suppressed osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation whereas methylparaben showed similar but less pronounced effects. Moreover, butylparaben, but not methylparaben, was shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ whereas neither of the paraben was shown to activate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) responsive reporter in C3H10T1/2 cells. The adipogenic effects of butylparaben were significantly attenuated by PPARγ knockdown, but not by GR knockdown. In contrast, paraben's effects on osteoblast differentiation were affected by both knockdowns. Collectively, the results demonstrate opposing effects of parabens on adipogenic and osteoblastogenic/chondrogenic differentiation of multipotent stem cells. In light of the recent findings that parabens are detected in human placenta and milk, our studies provide rationales to study paraben exposure during early development of life in the future.",PMC5528845

In humans, prenatal BPA exposure is associated with sex-specific behavioural problems in children, and HPA axis dysregulation may be a biological mechanism. The objective of the current study was to examine sex differences in associations between prenatal maternal urinary BPA concentration and HPA axis function in 3 month old infants. Mother-infant pairs (n = 132) were part of the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition study, a longitudinal birth cohort recruited (2010-2012) during pregnancy. Maternal spot urine samples collected during the 2nd trimester were analyzed for total BPA and creatinine. Infant saliva samples collected prior to and after a blood draw were analyzed for cortisol. Linear growth curve models were used to characterize changes in infant cortisol as a function of prenatal BPA exposure. Higher maternal BPA was associated with increases in baseline cortisol among females (β = 0.13 log μg/dL; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.26), but decreases among males (β = -0.22 log μg/dL; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.05). In contrast, higher BPA was associated with increased reactivity in males (β = .30 log μg/dL; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.56) but decreased reactivity in females (β = -0.15 log μg/dL; 95% CI: -0.35, 0.05). Models adjusting for creatinine yielded similar results. Prenatal BPA exposure is associated with sex-specific changes in infant HPA axis function. The biological plausibility of these findings is supported by their consistency with evidence in rodent models. Furthermore, these data support the hypotheses that sexually dimorphic changes in children's behaviour following prenatal BPA exposure are mediated by sexually dimorphic changes in HPA axis function.",PMC5437646

We investigated whether inhibition of deiodinases, which convert thyroxine (T4) to the more biologically active form, 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3), would impact swim bladder inflation. Two experiments were conducted using a model deiodinase inhibitor, iopanoic acid (IOP). First, fathead minnow embryos were exposed to 0.6, 1.9, or 6.0 mg/L or control water until 6 d postfertilization (dpf), at which time posterior swim bladder inflation was assessed. To examine anterior swim bladder inflation, a second study was conducted with 6-dpf larvae exposed to the same IOP concentrations until 21 dpf. Fish from both studies were sampled for T4/T3 measurements and gene transcription analyses. Incidence and length of inflated posterior swim bladders were significantly reduced in the 6.0 mg/L treatment at 6 dpf. Incidence of inflation and length of anterior swim bladder were significantly reduced in all IOP treatments at 14 dpf, but inflation recovered by 18 dpf. Throughout the larval study, whole-body T4 concentrations increased and T3 concentrations decreased in all IOP treatments. Consistent with hypothesized compensatory responses, deiodinase-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was up-regulated in the larval study, and thyroperoxidase mRNA was down-regulated in all IOP treatments in both studies.

Pregnant rats received DBP at a dose of 850 mg/kg BW/day by oral perfusion during gestational days 14-18. In DBP exposed newborn offspring, gross observation and histopathological examination revealed the dysplasia of kidney. The expression of genes related to renal development was also changed. In DBP exposed adult offspring, histopathological examination and Masson's trichrome staining revealed the pathological changes of renal fibrosis. Furthermore, higher expression levels of transforming growth factor- β (TGF-β) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were also detected. In vitro studies reveal that DBP promoted the activation of NRK49F cells and G2/M arrest in NRK52E cells at a sublethal dose. The effect of DBP on these cell lines was linked to the generation of oxidative stress. In addition, DBP induced oxidative stress in both renal fibroblasts and tubular epithelial cells, whereas vitamin C ameliorated the changes caused by DBP.

Evidence suggests that phthalates may have non-monotonic effects on reproductive hormone activity. With exposure to phthalates virtually ubiquitous among industrialized populations, identifying unexposed and/or minimally exposed human populations is essential for understanding the effects of low level exposures. Our primary objective was to quantify urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in the Tsimane', a remote population of Bolivian forager-horticulturalists. Our secondary objectives were to determine if phthalate metabolite concentrations vary in relation to access to market goods; and to explore relationships between phthalate and reproductive hormone metabolite concentrations. Given that phthalate exposure is of particular concern during fetal development, we focused on reproductive age women in the current analyses. Phthalate metabolites were assayed in urine samples from 59 naturally cycling, reproductive age Tsimane' women. Market access was assessed as: (1) distance from residence to the largest nearby town (San Borja, Bolivia) and (2) Spanish fluency. Urinary reproductive hormone metabolite concentrations were quantified using enzyme immunoassays. We fit linear models to examine: (1) predictors of phthalate exposure; and (2) relationships between urinary phthalate and reproductive hormone metabolite concentrations. Eight phthalate metabolites were detectable in at least 75% of samples. Median concentrations were up to an order of magnitude lower than industrialized populations. Proximity to San Borja and Spanish fluency were strong predictors of exposure. In exploratory analyses, the sum of the di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP) and Mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) were significantly associated with altered concentrations of urinary reproductive hormone metabolites. Remote, subsistence populations, like the Tsimane', offer a unique window into the health effects of endocrine active compounds because: (1) exposures are low and likely to be first generation; (2) a natural fertility lifestyle allows for exploration of reproductive effects; and (3) ever-increasing globalization will result in increasing exposure in the next decade.",PMC5512270

However, the impact of this exposure on second-filial-generation (F2) and third-filial-generation (F3) females was unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to the phthalate mixture induces multigenerational and transgenerational effects on female reproduction. Pregnant CD-1 dams were orally dosed with vehicle (tocopherol-stripped corn oil) or a phthalate mixture (20 and 200 µg/kg/d, 200 and 500 mg/kg/d) daily from gestational day 10 to birth. Adult F1 females born to these dams were used to generate the F2 generation and adult F2 females born to F1 females were used to generate the F3 generation. F2 and F3 females were subjected to tissue collections and fertility tests. Prenatal phthalate mixture exposure increased uterine weight, anogenital distance, and body weight; induced cystic ovaries; and caused fertility complications in the F2 generation.

Previously we showed that acute exposure to BPA promoted arrhythmias in female rat hearts through estrogen receptor rapid signaling. Progesterone (P4) and estrogen have antagonistic or complementary actions in a number of tissues and systems. In the current study, we examined the influence and possible protective effect of P4 on the rapid cardiac actions of BPA in female rat cardiac myocytes. Preincubation with physiological concentration (1 nM) of P4 abolished BPA-induced triggered activities in female cardiac myocytes. Further, P4 abrogated BPA-induced alterations in Ca2+ handling, including elevated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and Ca2+ load. Key to the inhibitory effect of P4 is its blockade of BPA-induced increase in the phosphorylation of phospholamban. At myocyte and protein levels, these inhibitory actions of P4 were blocked by pretreatment with the nuclear P4 receptor (nPR) antagonist RU486. Analysis using membrane-impermeable bovine serum albumin-conjugated P4 suggested that the actions of P4 were mediated by membrane-initiated signaling. Inhibitory G (Gi) protein and phophoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), but not tyrosine protein kinase activation, were involved in the observed effects of P4. In conclusion, P4 exerts an acute protective effect against BPA-induced arrhythmogenesis in female cardiac myocytes through nPR and the Gi/PI3K signaling pathway. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of EDCs in the context of native hormonals and may provide potential therapeutic strategies for protection against the cardiac toxicities associated with BPA exposure.",PMC5460806

Mean overlap for differentially expressed genes among laboratories was approximately 50%, which improved to approximately 59.0% using a standardized analysis pipeline. The dynamic range of fold change estimates was variable between laboratories, but ranking transcripts by their relative fold difference resulted in a positive relationship for comparisons between any 2 laboratories (mean R2  > 0.9, p < 0.001). Ten estrogen-responsive genes encompassing a fold change range from dramatic (>20-fold; e.g., vitellogenin) to subtle (∼2-fold; i.e., block of proliferation 1) were identified as differentially expressed, suggesting that laboratories can consistently identify transcripts that are known a priori to be perturbed by a chemical stressor. Thus, attention should turn toward identifying core transcriptional networks using focused arrays for specific chemicals. In addition, agreed-on bioinformatics pipelines and the ranking of genes based on fold change (as opposed to p value) should be considered in environmental risk assessment. These recommendations are expected to improve comparisons across laboratories and advance the use of omics in regulations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:2593-2601. © 2017 SETAC.",PMC6145073

Controlling contaminations in the laboratory is challenging, especially when their source is unknown. Unfortunately, EDC contaminations can interfere with the interpretation of data during toxicological evaluations. We propose that the male CD-1 mouse mammary gland is a sensitive bioassay to evaluate the inadvertent contamination of animal colonies. We evaluated mammary glands collected from two CD-1 mouse populations with distinct environmental histories. Population 1 was born and raised in a commercial laboratory with unknown EDC exposures; Population 2 was the second generation raised in an animal facility with limited exposures to xenoestrogens from caging, feed, etc. Mammary glands were collected from all animals and evaluated using morphometric techniques to quantify morphological characteristics of the mammary gland. Population 1 (with suspected history of environmental chemical exposure) and Population 2 (with known limited history of xenoestrogen exposure) were morphologically distinguishable in adult males, prepubertal females, and pubertal females. Mammary glands from males raised in the commercial animal facility were significantly more developed, with larger ductal trees and more branching points. The appearance of these mammary glands was consistent with prior reports of male mice exposed to low doses of bisphenol A (BPA) during early development. In females, the two populations were morphologically distinct at both prepuberty and puberty, with the most striking differences observed in the number, size, and density of terminal end buds, e.g. highly proliferative structures found in the developing mammary gland. Collectively, these results suggest that the mouse mammary gland has the potential to be used as a sentinel organ to evaluate and distinguish animal colonies raised in different environmental conditions including potential EDC exposures. Our findings could help researchers that wish to perform a posteriori evaluations to determine whether inadvertent contamination with xenoestrogens (and potentially other EDCs) has occurred in their animal colonies, especially after new materials (feed, caging, water bottles) have been introduced. Finally, our results challenge the relatively common practice of using historical controls in toxicological experiments.",PMC5345180

Rodent models and human epidemiological studies have linked this chemical to neurobehavior impairments. In California mice, developmental exposure to BPA results in sociosexual disorders at adulthood, including communication and biparental care deficits, behaviors that are primarily regulated by the hypothalamus. Thus, we sought to examine the transcriptomic profile in this brain region of juvenile male and female California mice offspring exposed from periconception through lactation to BPA or ethinyl estradiol (EE, estrogen present in birth control pills and considered a positive estrogen control for BPA studies). Two weeks prior to breeding, P0 females were fed a control diet, or this diet supplemented with 50 mg BPA/kg feed weight or 0.1 ppb EE, and continued on the diets through lactation. At weaning, brains from male and female offspring were collected, hypothalamic RNA isolated, and RNA-seq analysis performed. Results indicate that BPA and EE groups clustered separately from controls with BPA and EE exposure leading to unique set of signature gene profiles. Kcnd3 was downregulated in the hypothalamus of BPA- and EE-exposed females, whereas Tbl2, Topors, Kif3a, and Phactr2 were upregulated in these groups. Comparison of transcripts differentially expressed in BPA and EE groups revealed significant enrichment of gene ontology terms associated with microtubule-based processes. Current results show that perinatal exposure to BPA or EE can result in several transcriptomic alterations, including those associated with microtubule functions, in the hypothalamus of California mice. It remains to be determined whether these genes mediate BPA-induced behavioral disruptions.",PMC5309579

Acute toxicity has been reported in aquatic organisms for some of the BZTs but their mode of action remains unknown. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the transcriptomic response of D. magna exposed to sublethal doses of 1H-benzotriazole (BTR), 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5MeBTR) and 5-chloro-1H-benzotriazole (5ClBTR) using RNA-sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR. Cellular and life-history endpoints (survival, number of neonates, growth) were also investigated. Significant effects on the molting frequency were observed after 21-d exposure to 5MeBTR and 5ClBTR. No effects on molting frequency were observed for BTR but RNA-seq results indicated that this BZT induced the up-regulation of genes coding for cuticular proteins, which could have compensated the molting disruption. Molting in cladocerans is actively controlled by ecdysteroid hormones. Complementary short-term temporal analysis (4- and 8-d exposure) of the transcription of genes related to molting and hormone-mediated processes indicated that the three compounds had specific modes of action. BTR induced the transcription of genes involved in 20-hydroxyecdysone synthesis, which suggests pro-ecdysteroid properties. 5ClBTR exposure induced protein activity and transcriptional levels of chitinase enzymes, associated with an impact on ecdysteroid signaling pathways, which could explain the decrease in molt frequency. Finally, 5MeBTR seemed to increase molt frequency through epigenetic processes. Overall, results suggested that molting effects observed at the physiological level could be linked to endocrine regulation impacts of BZTs at the molecular level.",PMC5308779

We used linear regression to examine relations of BPA and phthalate exposure with peripubertal serum lipids, while also adjusting for child age, sex, and specific gravity. While in utero EDC exposure was not associated with lipid profile, higher concurrent levels of mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), and dibutyl phthalate metabolites (DBP) corresponded with lower total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) in boys; e.g., an interquartile range increment in MCPP corresponded with 7.4% (2.0%, 12.8%) lower total cholesterol and 12.7% (3.8%, 21.6%) lower LDL-C.

Using the zebrafish model system, an embryonic atrazine exposure was previously reported to decrease spawning rates with an increase in progesterone and ovarian follicular atresia in adult females. In addition, alterations in genes associated with distinct molecular pathways of the endocrine system were observed in brain and gonad tissue of the adult females and males. Current hypotheses for mechanistic changes in the developmental origins of health and disease include genetic (e.g., copy number alterations) or epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) mechanisms. As such, in the current study we investigated whether an atrazine exposure would generate copy number alterations (CNAs) in the zebrafish genome. A zebrafish fibroblast cell line was used to limit detection to CNAs caused by the chemical exposure. First, cells were exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations and a crystal violet assay was completed, showing confluency decreased by ~60% at 46.3μM. Cells were then exposed to 0, 0.463, 4.63, or 46.3μM atrazine and array comparative genomic hybridization completed. Results showed 34, 21, and 44 CNAs in the 0.463, 4.63, and 46.3μM treatments, respectively. Furthermore, CNAs were associated with previously reported gene expression alterations in adult male and female zebrafish. This study demonstrates that atrazine exposure can generate CNAs that are linked to gene expression alterations observed in adult zebrafish exposed to atrazine during embryogenesis providing a mechanism of the developmental origins of atrazine endocrine disruption.",PMC5325771

In the present study, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP during a critical period for gonads differentiation to testes on male mice offspring reproductive parameters, including the genome-wide RNA expression and associated promoter methylation status in the sperm of the first filial generation. It was observed that adult male offspring displayed symptoms similar to the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome. A combination of sperm transcriptome and methylome data analysis allowed to detect a long-lasting DEHP-induced and robust promoter methylation-associated silencing of almost the entire cluster of the seminal vesicle secretory proteins and antigen genes, which are known to play a fundamental role in sperm physiology. It also resulted in the detection of a DEHP-induced promoter demethylation associated with an up-regulation of three genes apparently not relevant for sperm physiology and partially related to the immune system. As previously reported, DEHP induced an increase in mir-615 microRNA expression and a genome-wide decrease in microRNA promoter methylation. A functional analysis revealed DEHP-induced enrichments in down-regulated gene transcripts coding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways, and in up-regulated gene transcripts coding for calcium binding and numerous myosin proteins.

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that the manifestation and severity of adverse outcomes is the result of interaction between developmental insults and the prevailing environment. Consistent with this premise, recent studies in sheep found prenatal BPA treatment prevented the adverse effects of postnatal obesity in inducing hypertension. The gene networks underlying these complex interactions are not known. mRNA-seq of myocardium was performed on four groups of four female sheep to assess the effects of prenatal BPA exposure, postnatal overfeeding and their interaction on gene transcription, pathway perturbations and functional effects. The effects of prenatal exposure to BPA, postnatal overfeeding, and prenatal BPA with postnatal overfeeding all resulted in transcriptional changes (85-141 significant differentially expressed genes). Although the effects of prenatal BPA and postnatal overfeeding did not involve dysregulation of many of the same genes, they affected a remarkably similar set of biological pathways. Furthermore, an additive or synergistic effect was not found in the combined treatment group, but rather prenatal BPA treatment led to a partial reversal of the effects of overfeeding alone. Many genes previously known to be affected by BPA and involved in obesity, hypertension, or heart disease were altered following these treatments, and AP-1, EGR1, and EGFR were key hubs affected by BPA and/or overfeeding.

In order to elucidate roles of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways and hepatic enzymes in thyroid-disrupting effects of DEHP, Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with DEHP by gavage for 30 consecutive days; Nthy-ori 3-1 cells were treated with DEHP with NAC, k-Ras siRNA or inhibitors (U0126 and wortmannin). Results showed that DEHP led to histopathologic changes in rat thyroid and liver, such as the decrease in thyroid follicular cavity diameter, hepatocyte edema. Triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were reduced. DEHP caused ROS production, oxidative stress and k-Ras upregulation, thereby activating the ERK and Akt pathways in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, TRH receptor (TRHr) level was elevated after the activation of the Akt pathway and was downregulated after the inhibition of the Akt pathway. However, TRHr was not modulated by the ERK pathway. Additionally, hepatic enzymes, including Ugt1a1, CYP2b1, Sult1e1, and Sult2b1, were significantly induced after DEHP exposure.

The mixture at 10, 100, and 500 µg/ml also decreased androstenedione, testosterone, estrone, and estradiol levels compared to control. The mixture (10, 100, and 500 µg/ml) reduced atresia rating, but it induced more oocyte fragmentation compared to control. The phthalate mixture at different doses adversely affected cell cycle regulators, antioxidant enzymes, apoptotic factors, steroidogenic enzymes, and receptors. Collectively, these data indicate that exposure to an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture reduces antral follicle growth, induces oocyte fragmentation, and decreases hormone production by adversely affecting the expression of cell cycle regulators, apoptotic factors, steroidogenic enzymes, and receptors.",PMC6075604

We investigated the effects of an emerging xenoestrogen, bisphenol S (BPS), on maternal behavior and brain in CD-1 mice exposed during pregnancy and lactation (F0 generation) and in female offspring exposed during gestation and perinatal development (F1 generation). We observed different effects in F0 and F1 dams for a number of components of maternal behavior, including time on the nest, time spent on nest building, latency to retrieve pups, and latency to retrieve the entire litter. We also characterized expression of estrogen receptor α in the medial preoptic area (MPOA) and quantified tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells in the ventral tegmental area, 2 brain regions critical for maternal care. BPS-treated females in the F0 generation had a statistically significant increase in estrogen receptor α expression in the caudal subregion of the central MPOA in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, there were no statistically significant effects of BPS on the MPOA in F1 dams or the ventral tegmental area in either generation. This work demonstrates that BPS affects maternal behavior and brain with outcomes depending on generation, dose, and postpartum period. Many studies examining effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals view the mother as a means by which offspring can be exposed during critical periods of development. Here, we demonstrate that pregnancy and lactation are vulnerable periods for the mother. We also show that developmental BPS exposure alters maternal behavior later in adulthood. Both findings have potential public health implications.",PMC5460783

Alterations to the epigenome termed ""epimutations"" include ""primary epimutations"" which are epigenetic alterations in the absence of genetic change and ""secondary epimutations"" which form following an initial genetic change. To determine if secondary epimutations contribute to transgenerational transmission of disease following in utero exposure to the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin, we exposed pregnant female rats carrying the lacI mutation-reporter transgene to vinclozolin and assessed the frequency of mutations in kidney tissue and sperm recovered from F1 and F3 generation progeny. Our results confirm that vinclozolin induces primary epimutations rather than secondary epimutations, but also suggest that some primary epimutations can predispose a subsequent accelerated accumulation of genetic mutations in F3 generation descendants that have the potential to contribute to transgenerational phenotypes. We therefore propose the existence of ""tertiary epimutations"" which are initial primary epimutations that promote genome instability leading to an accelerated accumulation of genetic mutations.",PMC5167269

Male, but not female, urinary concentrations of select metabolites of phthalates and phthalate alternatives are associated with diminished blastocyst quality. Although phthalates are endocrine disrupting compounds associated with adverse reproductive health, they are in widespread use across the world. Male and female preconception exposures to select phthalates have been previously associated with adverse reproductive outcomes in both the general population and in those undergoing IVF. This prospective cohort included 50 subfertile couples undergoing IVF in western Massachusetts. This study includes the first 50 couples recruited from the Baystate Medical Center's Fertility Center in Springfield, MA, as part of the Sperm Environmental Epigenetics and Development Study (SEEDS). Relevant data from both partners, including embryo quality at the cleavage (Day 3) and blastocyst (Day 5) stages, were collected by clinic personnel during the normal course of an IVF cycle. A spot urine sample was collected from both male and female partners on the same day as semen sample procurement and oocyte retrieval. Concentrations of 17 urinary metabolite were quantified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and normalized via specific gravity. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI, with urinary phthalates and phthalate alternatives fitted as continuous variables and embryo quality as a binary variable. The 50 couples contributed 761 oocytes, of which 423 progressed to the cleavage stage, 261 were high-quality cleavage stage embryos, 137 were transferrable quality blastocysts and 47 were high-quality blastocysts. At the cleavage stage, male urinary monoethyl phthalate concentrations were positively associated with high-quality cleavage stage embryos (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.43, P = 0.04); no other significant associations were observed at this stage. At the blastocyst stage, male urinary concentrations of monobenzyl phthalate (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.36-0.84, P = 0.01), mono-3-hydroxybutyl phthalate (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.76, P = 0.01), mono-n-butyl phthalate (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.73, P < 0.01) and monomethyl phthalate (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.26-0.60, P < 0.01) were inversely associated with high-quality blastocysts. A borderline statistically significant relationship was observed for male concentrations of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.27-1.00, P = 0.05) and cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-monocarboxy isooctyl ester (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.04-1.03, P = 0.05) at the blastocyst stage. Similar inverse associations were observed between male urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and likelihood of transferrable quality blastocysts. For female partners, select metabolites were positively associated with odds of high or transferrable blastocyst quality, but the observed associations were not consistent across blastocyst quality measures or between sex-specific and couples-level models. All models were adjusted for age of both partners, urinary metabolite concentrations of female partners and male infertility status, while models of blastocysts were additionally adjusted for embryo quality at cleavage stage. Our modest sample included only 50 couples contributing one cycle each. In addition, non-differential misclassification of exposure remains a concern given the single-spot urine collection and the short half-life of phthalates. Our results suggest an inverse association between male preconception concentrations of select phthalate metabolites and blastocyst quality, likely occurring after genomic activation. If corroborated with other studies, such findings will have public health and clinical significance for both the general population and those undergoing IVF.

Lactating females received daily, by gavage, doses of 10 μg/kg of EE diluted in 100 μl of mineral oil from the 1st to 10th postnatal day of the pups (EE group). In the control group (C), the lactating females received only the vehicle. Upon completing 120 days of age, the male offspring were euthanized and the prostates collected for analyses. We employed morphological, stereological-morphometrical, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural methods. The results showed that the postnatal exposure to EE doubled the prostatic complex weight, increasing the epithelial and stromal compartments, in addition to the secretory activity of the ventral lobe of the prostate. All glands exposed to EE showed strong stromal remodelling, and some foci of epithelial hyperplasia and inflammatory infiltrate in both luminal and epithelial or stromal compartments. Cells positive for anti-AR and anti-PCNA reactions increased into the epithelial and stromal tissues. ERα-positive cells, which are normally found in the stromal compartment of intact prostates, were frequently observed in the prostatic epithelium of treated animals. This study demonstrated that the exposure to EE during postnatal development causes histophysiological alterations in this gland, predisposing to the development of prostatic lesions during life. These results are important for public health, considering that women worldwide have commonly used EE. Moreover, the bioaccumulation of this chemical has increased in different ecosystems.",PMC5206819

We investigated the relationship between prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite, triclosan, and BPA concentrations and visual-spatial abilities in a prospective cohort of 198 mother-child dyads. Data are from a prospective cohort in Cincinnati, OH (HOME Study). We measured nine phthalate metabolites, triclosan, and BPA in maternal urine samples collected at 16 and 26 weeks of gestation. We assessed children's visual-spatial abilities at 8 years of age using the Virtual Morris Water Maze (VMWM), a computerized version of the rodent Morris Water Maze. We quantified the covariate-adjusted change in the time or distance to complete the VMWM and time spent in the correct quadrant during a probe trial with an interquartile range increase in chemical concentrations using linear mixed models and linear regression, respectively. Boys completed the VMWM faster (4.1s; 95% CI:-7.1, -1.2) and in less distance (1.4 units; 95% CI:-2.8, 0) than girls. Overall, children with higher mono-n-butyl (MnBP), mono-benzyl (MBzP), and mono-carboxypropyl phthalate concentrations completed the VMWM in less time and distance than children with lower concentrations. For example, children with higher MnBP concentrations completed the VMWM in 0.9 less distance units (95% CI:-1.8, -0.0). Child sex modified the association between MnBP and VMWM performance. In girls, higher MnBP concentrations were associated with longer time (1.7s; 95% CI: -0.7, 4.1) and shorter distance (-1.7 units; 95% CI: -2.8, -0.5), whereas in boys, it was associated with shorter time (-3.0s; 95% CI:-5.6, -0.4), but not distance (-0.1 units; 95% CI:1.4, 1.0). Other phthalate metabolites, triclosan, and BPA were not associated with VMWM performance, and sex did not consistently modify these associations.

Our primary goal was to investigate associations between placental BFRs, TH levels, Type 3 deiodinase (DIO3) activity and TH sulfotransferase (SULT) activities. Placenta samples collected from 95 women who delivered term (>37 weeks) infants in Durham, NC, USA (enrolled 2010-2011) were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (2,4,6-TBP), THs (T4, T3 and rT3), and DIO3 and TH SULT activities. PBDEs and 2,4,6-TBP were detected in all placenta samples. PBDEs were higher in placental tissues from male infants compared to female infants, with 2,4,6-TBP and BDE-209 levels approximately twice as high. Among male infants, placental BDE-99 and BDE-209 were negatively associated with rT3 placental levels. For female infants, placental BDE-99 and 2,4,6-TBP were positively associated with T3 concentrations. DIO3 activity was also significantly higher in placental tissues from male infants compared to females, while 3,3'-T2 SULT activity was significantly higher in placental tissues from females compared to males. Among males, several PBDE congeners were positively correlated with T3 SULT, while BDE-99 was negatively associated with T3 SULT among females. Associations generally remained after adjustment for potential confounding by maternal age and gestational age at delivery. These results suggest BFRs accumulate in the placenta and potentially alter TH function in a sex-specific manner, a possible mechanism to explain the sex-dependent impacts of environmental exposure on children's growth and development. More research is needed to elucidate the effects of BFRs on placenta function during pregnancy, as well as the biological consequences of exposure and thyroid disruption.",PMC5123327

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship of in utero and childhood exposure to these purported EDCs and reproductive hormones in adolescent boys who participated in CHAMACOS, an ongoing birth cohort in California's Salinas Valley. We measured o,p'- and p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, PBDEs and PCBs in serum collected from mothers during pregnancy or at delivery and from their sons at 9 years. We measured concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and total testosterone (T) from 234 of their sons at 12 years. In adjusted models, we found that a 10-fold increase in maternal prenatal serum concentrations of BDE-153 was associated with a 22.2% increase (95% CI: 1.0, 47.9) in FSH, a 96.6% increase (95% CI: 35.7, 184.7) in LH, and a 92.4% increase (95% CI: 20.9, 206.2) increase in T. Similarly, BDE-100 concentrations were associated with increases in boys' LH levels. A 10-fold increase in total prenatal ΣPCBs was associated with a 64.5% increase (95% CI: 8.6, 149.0) in FSH, primarily driven by non- dioxin-like congeners. Boys' hormone levels were only marginally associated with prenatal DDT or DDE in primary models, but when boys' Tanner stage at age 12 was added to models, prenatal maternal DDT levels were associated with decreases in LH (adjusted percent change per 10-fold increase=-18.5%, 95% CI: -29.8, -5.4) and T (percent change=-18.2%, 95% CI: -30.2, -4.2) and DDE with LH (percent change=-18.3%, 95% CI: -32.9, -0.6). Exposures measured in the children's serum at 9 years also showed associations between BDE-153 and ΣPCBs. However, there is evidence that these associations appear to be mediated by child BMI.

The present study investigated whether exposure to ECs only during preconceptional period or only during pregnancy perturbed key regulatory genes within the hypothalamus and pituitary gland and whether these effects were different from chronic (life-long) exposure to biosolid ECs. The findings demonstrate that the timing and duration of maternal EC exposure influences the subsequent effects on the foetal neuroendocrine system in a sex-specific manner. Maternal exposure prior to conception, or during pregnancy only, altered the expression of key foetal neuroendocrine regulatory systems such as gonadotrophin-releasing hormone and kisspeptin to a greater extent than when maternal exposure was 'life-long'. Furthermore, hypothalamic gene expression was affected to a greater extent in males than in females and, following EC exposure, male foetuses expressed more 'female-like' mRNA levels for some key neuroendocrine genes. This is the first study to show that 'real-life' maternal exposure to low levels of a complex cocktail of chemicals prior to conception can subsequently affect the developing foetal neuroendocrine system. These findings demonstrate that the developing neuroendocrine system is sensitive to EC mixtures in a sex-dimorphic manner likely to predispose to reproductive dysfunction in later life.",PMC5621486

This study demonstrates the use of a combination of instrumental chemical analyses, effects-based monitoring, and bio-effects prediction approaches to help identify potential hazards and priority contaminants in two Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs), the Lower Green Bay/Fox River located near Green Bay, WI, USA and the Milwaukee Estuary, located near Milwaukee, WI, USA. Fathead minnows were caged at four sites within each AOC (eight sites total). Following 4d of in situ exposure, tissues and biofluids were sampled and used for targeted biological effects analyses. Additionally, 4d composite water samples were collected concurrently at each caged fish site and analyzed for 132 analytes as well as evaluated for total estrogenic and androgenic activity using cell-based bioassays. Of the analytes examined, 75 were detected in composite samples from at least one site. Based on multiple analyses, one site in the East River and another site near a paper mill discharge in the Lower Green Bay/Fox River AOC, were prioritized due to their estrogenic and androgenic activity, respectively. The water samples from other sites generally did not exhibit significant estrogenic or androgenic activity, nor was there evidence for endocrine disruption in the fish exposed at these sites as indicated by the lack of alterations in ex vivo steroid production, circulating steroid concentrations, or vitellogenin mRNA expression in males. Induction of hepatic cyp1a mRNA expression was detected at several sites, suggesting the presence of chemicals that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. To expand the scope beyond targeted investigation of endpoints selected a priori, several bio-effects prediction approaches were employed to identify other potentially disturbed biological pathways and related chemical constituents that may warrant future monitoring at these sites. For example, several chemicals such as diethylphthalate and naphthalene, and genes and related pathways, such as cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 (CHRM3), estrogen receptor alpha1 (esr1), chemokine ligand 10 protein (CXCL10), tumor protein p53 (p53), and monoamine oxidase B (Maob), were identified as candidates for future assessments at these AOCs.

Here, we used a diet and breeding regimen that produces transgenerational effects on behaviors. C57BL/6J mice consumed control or BPA-containing diets during pregnancy. We examined vasopressin (AVP) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) immunoreactivity (ir) in sexually dimorphic brain regions from first-generation (F1) offspring and transgenerational effects of BPA in third-generation offspring. In all but one brain region examined, the expected sex differences were noted in both generations of control mice. In F1 mice, a diet by sex interaction was present for AVP-ir in the lateral septum and posterodorsal medial amygdala. In both regions, BPA exposure reduced immunoreactivity in male brains. An interaction between diet and sex for ERα-ir in the ventromedial hypothalamus was caused by reduced immunoreactivity in BPA-exposed females. Of interest, BPA had transgenerational effects on ERα-ir in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.

Serum from 424 pregnant women participating in the NICHD Scandinavian Successive Small-for-gestational Age (SGA) births study was collected in 1986-1988, and analyses of two PFASs and six OCs were conducted. Associations between EDCs and geographic, time dependent, socio-demographic and pregnancy related variables were evaluated by using multivariable linear regression models. Previous breastfeeding duration, time since last breastfeeding period, sampling date and country of residence were important factors associated with serum levels of PFOS and PFOA. Smoking status and pre-pregnancy BMI were negatively associated with PFOS, and maternal height was borderline negatively associated with PFOS and PFOA. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was negatively associated with PFOS in a sub-sample. Maternal serum levels of OCs were positively associated with maternal age, and negatively associated with previous breastfeeding duration and sampling date. Smoking had a consistently negative association with PCB 118 in a dose-dependent manner. Education level, pre-pregnancy BMI and alcohol consumption varied in importance according to the compound under study. Several maternal factors, including potentially modifiable factors, markers of pregnancy physiology and factors also related to perinatal outcomes were associated with EDC levels.

A shift from the dominant stereoisomer γ-HBCD to α-HBCD is detected in humans and wildlife. Considering CM-HBCD has been implicated in neurodevelopment and endocrine disruption, with expected metabolism perturbations, we performed metabolomics on mice serum obtained during a window-of-developmental neurotoxicity to draw correlations between early-life exposures and developmental outcomes and to predict health risks. Six female C57BL/6 mice at postnatal day (PND) 10 were administered a single gavage dose of α-, γ-, or CM-HBCD at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used to analyze 60 μL serum aliquots of blood collected 4 days post-oral exposure. Infantile mice exposed to α-, γ-, or CM-HBCD demonstrated differences in endogenous metabolites by treatment and dose groups, including metabolites involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism, citric acid cycle, and neurodevelopment. Ketone bodies, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate, were nonstatistically elevated, when compared with mean control levels, in all treatment and dose groups, while glucose, pyruvate, and alanine varied. Acetoacetate was significantly increased in the 10 mg/kg α-HBCD and was nonsignificantly decreased with CM-HBCD. A third ketone body, acetone, was significantly lower in the 30 mg/kg α-HBCD group with significant increases in pyruvate at the same treatment and dose group. Metabolites significant in differentiating treatment and dose groups were also identified, including decreases in amino acids glutamate (excitatory neurotransmitter in learning and memory) and phenylalanine (neurotransmitter precursor) after α-HBCD and γ-HBCD exposure, respectively.

Whether PCBs alter other sexually dimorphic behaviors such as those involved in anxiety is poorly understood. To address this, pregnant rat dams were injected twice, on gestational days 16 and 18, with the weakly estrogenic PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221) at one of two low dosages (0.5mg/kg or 1.0mg/kg, hereafter 1.0 and 0.5), estradiol benzoate (EB; 50μg/kg) as a positive estrogenic control, or the vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil). We also conducted a comprehensive assessment of developmental milestones of the F1 male and female offspring. There were no effects of treatment on sex ratio at birth and age at eye opening. Puberty, assessed by vaginal opening in females and preputial separation in males, was not affected in females but was advanced in males treated with A1221 (1.0). Males and females treated with A1221 (both dosages) were heavier in early adulthood relative to controls. The earliest manifestation of this effect developed in males prior to puberty and in females slightly later, during puberty. Anxiety-like behaviors were tested using the light:dark box and elevated plus maze tests in adulthood. In females, anxiety behaviors were unaffected by treatment. Males treated with A1221 (1.0) showed reduced indices of anxiety and increased activity in the light:dark box but not the elevated plus maze. EB failed to replicate the phenotype produced by A1221 for any of the developmental and behavioral endpoints. Collectively, these results indicate that PCBs increase body weight in both sexes, but their effects on anxiety-like behaviors are specific to males. Furthermore, differences between the results of A1221 and EB suggest that the PCBs are likely acting through mechanisms distinct from their estrogenic activity.",PMC5603326

An unexplored possibility is that EDC-exposure might alter the gut microbial composition. Gut flora and their products may thus be mediating factors for the disease-causing effects of these chemicals. To examine the effects of EDCs on the gut microbiome, female and male monogamous and biparental California mice (Peromyscus californicus) were exposed to BPA (50 mg/kg feed weight) or EE (0.1 ppb) or control diet from periconception through weaning. 16s rRNA sequencing was performed on bacterial DNA isolated from fecal samples, and analyses performed for P0 and F1 males and females. Both BPA and EE induced generational and sex-dependent gut microbiome changes. Many of the bacteria, e.g. Bacteroides, Mollicutes, Prevotellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Akkermansia, Methanobrevibacter, Sutterella, whose proportions increase with exposure to BPA or EE in the P0 or F1 generation are associated with different disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), metabolic disorders, and colorectal cancer. However, the proportion of the beneficial bacterium, Bifidobacterium, was also elevated in fecal samples of BPA- and EE-exposed F1 females. Intestinal flora alterations were also linked to changes in various metabolic and other pathways. Thus, BPA and EE exposure may disrupt the normal gut flora, which may in turn result in systemic effects. Probiotic supplementation might be an effective means to mitigate disease-promoting effects of these chemicals.",PMC5103659

We assessed whether maternal occupational exposure to EDCs during pregnancy as classified by application of a job exposure matrix was associated with birth weight, term low birth weight (LBW), length of gestation, and preterm delivery. Using individual participant data from 133,957 mother-child pairs in 13 European cohorts spanning births from 1994 through 2011, we linked maternal job titles with exposure to 10 EDC groups as assessed through a job exposure matrix. For each group, we combined the two levels of exposure categories (possible and probable) and compared birth outcomes with the unexposed group (exposure unlikely). We performed meta-analyses of cohort-specific estimates. Eleven percent of pregnant women were classified as exposed to EDCs at work during pregnancy, based on job title. Classification of exposure to one or more EDC group was associated with an increased risk of term LBW [odds ratio (OR) = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.49], as were most specific EDC groups; this association was consistent across cohorts. Further, the risk increased with increasing number of EDC groups (OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.10, 4.06 for exposure to four or more EDC groups). There were few associations (p < 0.05) with the other outcomes; women holding job titles classified as exposed to bisphenol A or brominated flame retardants were at higher risk for longer length of gestation. Results from our large population-based birth cohort design indicate that employment during pregnancy in occupations classified as possibly or probably exposed to EDCs was associated with an increased risk of term LBW.

Impaired glucocorticoid action has been associated with immune disorders. Thus, there is an increasing interest to identify chemicals disrupting glucocorticoid action. The widely used flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) was reported earlier to potently inhibit glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and moderately androgen receptor (AR) activity in yeast-based reporter gene assays. To further characterize possible GR disrupting effects of TBBPA, transactivation experiments using a human HEK-293 cell-based reporter gene assay and cell-free receptor binding experiments were performed in the present study. Both, transactivation and GR binding experiments failed to detect any activity of TBBPA on GR function. Molecular docking calculations supported this observation. Additionally, the current study could confirm the antiandrogenic activity of TBBPA seen in the yeast assay, although the effect was an order of magnitude less pronounced in the HEK-293 cell-based system. In conclusion, TBBPA does not directly affect GR function and, considering its rapid metabolism and low concentrations found in humans, it is unlikely to cause adverse effects by acting through AR. This study emphasizes the use of cell-free assays in combination with cell-based assays for the in vitro evaluation of endocrine disrupting chemicals.",PMC6828555

In this decade, endocrine disrupting chemicals in surface and ground water of many areas and increasing observation of freshwater male fish displaying female sexual characteristics have been reported. Here we identified the difference in intestinal microbiota between male and female zebrafish, and revealed the influence of endocrine disrupting chemicals on zebrafish intestinal microbiota by using high-throughput sequencing. The results indicated that Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were dominant in the gut of zebrafish and there were no obvious gender-specific intestinal microbial patterns. Two endocrine disrupting chemicals, Estradiol (E2) and Bisphenol A (BPA), were selected to treat male zebrafish for 5 weeks. E2 and BPA increased vitellogenin expression in the liver of male zebrafish and altered the intestinal microbial composition with the abundance of the phylum CKC4 increased significantly.

Ethinylestradiol (EE2) and estrone (E1) have recently been included in a watch list of environmental pollutants under the European Water Framework Directive. Municipal wastewater treatment plants are major contributors to the estrogenic potency of surface waters. Much of the estrogenic potency of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents can be attributed to the discharge of steroid estrogens including estradiol (E2), EE2 and E1 due to incomplete removal of these substances at the treatment plant. An evaluation of the efficacy of wastewater treatment processes requires the quantitative determination of individual substances most often undertaken using chemical analysis methods. Most frequently used methods include Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS/MS) or Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LCMS/MS) using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Although very useful for regulatory purposes, targeted chemical analysis can only provide data on the compounds (and specific metabolites) monitored. Ecotoxicology methods additionally ensure that any by-products produced or unknown estrogenic compounds present are also assessed via measurement of their biological activity. A number of in vitro bioassays including the Yeast Estrogen Screen (YES) are available to measure the estrogenic activity of wastewater samples. Chemical analysis in conjunction with in vivo and in vitro bioassays provides a useful toolbox for assessment of the efficacy and suitability of wastewater treatment processes with respect to estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds.

Intrauterine paracetamol exposure during 8-14 weeks of gestation is associated with shorter AGD from birth to 24 months of age. The increasing prevalence of male reproductive disorders may reflect environmental influences on foetal testicular development during the MPW. Animal and human xenograft studies have demonstrated that paracetamol reduces foetal testicular testosterone production, consistent with reported epidemiological associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and cryptorchidism. Prospective cohort study (Cambridge Baby Growth Study), with recruitment of pregnant women at ~12 post-menstrual weeks of gestation from a single UK maternity unit between 2001 and 2009, and 24 months of infant follow-up. Of 2229 recruited women, 1640 continued with the infancy study after delivery, of whom 676 delivered male infants and completed a medicine consumption questionnaire. Mothers self-reported medicine consumption during pregnancy by a questionnaire administered during the perinatal period. Infant AGD (measured from 2006 onwards), penile length and testicular descent were assessed at 0, 3, 12, 18 and 24 months of age, and age-specific Z scores were calculated. Associations between paracetamol intake during three gestational periods (<8 weeks, 8-14 weeks and >14 weeks) and these outcomes were tested by linear mixed models. Two hundred and twenty-five (33%) of six hundred and eighty-one male infants were exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy, of whom sixty-eight were reported to be exposed during 8-14 weeks. AGD measurements were available for 434 male infants. Paracetamol exposure during 8-14 weeks of gestation, but not any other period, was associated with shorter AGD (by 0.27 SD, 95% CI 0.06-0.48, P = 0.014) from birth to 24 months of age. This reduction was independent of body size. Paracetamol exposure was not related to penile length or testicular descent. Confounding by other drugs or endocrine-disrupting chemicals cannot be discounted. The cohort was not fully representative of pregnant women in the UK, particularly in terms of maternal ethnicity and smoking prevalence.

One-sided Chi2 tests were used to calculate P values. Comparisons of differentially expressed genes between mammary tumors in in utero EE2-exposed and control rats, and between anti-estrogen-resistant LCC9 and -sensitive LCC1 human breast cancer cells, were also performed. In our preclinical model, 54.2% of mammary tumors in the control rats exhibited a complete response to TAM, of which 23.1% acquired resistance with continued anti-estrogen treatment and recurred. Mammary tumors in the EE2 offspring were statistically significantly less likely to respond to TAM (P = .047) and recur (P = .007). In the EE2 offspring, but not in controls, adding valproic acid and hydralazine to TAM prevented recurrence (P < .001). Three downregulated and hypermethylated genes (KLF4, LGALS3, MICB) and one upregulated gene (ETV4) were identified in EE2 tumors and LCC9 breast cancer cells, and valproic acid and hydralazine normalized the altered expression of all four genes.

MCF-7 and PDX-derived mammospheres exhibited increased size and up-regulation of canonical stem cell markers ALDH1, NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 when exposed to mePB; these effects were not observed for MDA-MB-231 (ER- ) mammospheres. As tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are also believed to be responsible for chemoresistance, mammospheres were treated with either tamoxifen or the pure anti-estrogen fulvestrant in the presence of mePB. Blocking the estrogenic response was not sufficient to block NANOG expression in mammospheres, pointing to a non-classic estrogen response or an ER-independent mechanism of mePB promotion of mammosphere activity. Overall, these results suggest that mePB increases breast cancer tumor proliferation through enhanced TIC activity, in part via regulation of NANOG, and that mePB may play a direct role in chemoresistance by modulating stem cell activity.

Cadmium (Cd) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical with the potential to interfere with morphogenesis and susceptibility to diseases in reproductive organs.

To test this hypothesis, we used the freshwater pulmonate snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, for which various genetic tools and a draft genome have recently become available, to investigate the effects of two steroid androgens on the development of mollusk secondary sexual organs. Here we present the results of exposures to two potent androgens, the vertebrate steroid; 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the pharmaceutical anabolic steroid; 17α-methyltestosterone (MT), under continuous flow-through conditions throughout embryonic development and up to sexual maturity. Secondary sexual gland morphology, histopathology and differential gene expression analysis were used to determine whether steroid androgens stimulated or inhibited organ development. No significant differences between tissues from control and exposed snails were identified, suggesting that these androgens elicited no biologically detectable response normally associated with exposure to androgens in vertebrate model systems. Identifying no effect of androgens in this mollusk is significant, not only in the context of the suitability of mollusks as alternative model organisms for testing vertebrate androgen receptor agonists but also, if applicable to other similar mollusks, in terms of the likely impacts of androgens and anti-androgenic pollutants present in the aquatic environment.",PMC4957768

Pregnant mothers were treated with or without CrVI (50ppmK2Cr2O7) through drinking water from gestational day (GD) 9.5-14.5, and placentas were analyzed on GD 18.5. Results indicated that CrVI increased apoptosis of trophoblasts, vascular endothelium of the metrial glands and yolk sac epithelium through caspase-3 and p53-dependent pathways. CrVI increased apoptosis in labyrinth and basal zones in a caspase-3-independent manner via AIF, and through an ATM-p53-NOXA-PUMA-p27 network.

It has been suggested that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals might increase the risk of hypospadias by interrupting normal urethral development. Using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a population-based case-control study, we considered the role of maternal exposure to atrazine, a widely used herbicide and potential endocrine disruptor, via drinking water in the etiology of 2nd and 3rd degree hypospadias. We used data on 343 hypospadias cases and 1,422 male controls in North Carolina, Arkansas, Iowa, and Texas from 1998-2005. Using catchment level stream and groundwater contaminant models from the US Geological Survey, we estimated atrazine concentrations in public water supplies and in private wells. We assigned case and control mothers to public water supplies based on geocoded maternal address during the critical window of exposure for hypospadias (i.e., gestational weeks 6-16). Using maternal questionnaire data about water consumption and drinking water, we estimated a surrogate for total maternal consumption of atrazine via drinking water. We then included additional maternal covariates, including age, race/ethnicity, parity, and plurality, in logistic regression analyses to consider an association between atrazine and hypospadias. When controlling for maternal characteristics, any association between hypospadias and daily maternal atrazine exposure during the critical window of genitourinary development was found to be weak or null (odds ratio for atrazine in drinking water = 1. 00, 95 % CI = 0.97 to 1.03 per 0.04 μg/day increase; odds ratio for maternal consumption = 1.02, 95 % CI = 0.99 to 1.05; per 0.05 μg/day increase). While the association that we observed was weak, our results suggest that additional research into a possible association between atrazine and hypospadias occurrence, using a more sensitive exposure metric, would be useful.",PMC4946150

We identified 111 EB-associated and 86 BPA-associated genes, with 20 in common, that have significant differentially methylated regions. Pathway analysis revealed cancer as the top common disease pathway. Bisulfite sequencing validated the differential methylation patterns observed by array analysis in 15 identified candidate genes. The methylation status of 7 (Pitx3, Wnt10b, Paqr4, Sox2, Chst14, Tpd52, Creb3l4) of these 15 genes exhibited an inverse correlation with gene expression in tissue samples. Cell-based assays, using 5-aza-cytidine-treated normal (NbE-1) and cancerous (AIT) rat prostate cells, added evidence of DNA methylation-mediated gene expression of 6 genes (exception: Paqr4). Functional connectivity of these genes was linked to embryonic stem cell pluripotency. Furthermore, clustering analyses using the dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that expression of this set of 7 genes was associated with recurrence-free survival of PCa patients. In conclusion, our study reveals that gene-specific promoter methylation changes, resulting from early-life EDC exposure in the rat, may serve as predictive epigenetic biomarkers of PCa recurrence, and raises the possibility that such exposure may impact human disease.",PMC5048723

In our previous studies, zebrafish was exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 parts per billion (μg/l) atrazine through embryogenesis, rinsed, and allowed to mature to adulthood. A decrease in spawning was observed with morphological alterations in offspring. In addition, adult females displayed an increase in ovarian progesterone and follicular atresia, alterations in levels of a serotonin metabolite and serotonin turnover in brain tissue, and transcriptome changes in brain and ovarian tissue supporting neuroendocrine alterations. As reproductive dysfunction is also influenced by males, this study assessed testes histology, hormone levels, and transcriptomic profiles of testes and brain tissue in the adult males. The embryonic atrazine exposure resulted in no alterations in body or testes weight, gonadosomatic index, testes histology, or levels of 11-ketotestosterone or testosterone. To further investigate potential alterations, transcriptomic profiles of adult male testes and brain tissue was completed. This analysis demonstrated alterations in genes associated with abnormal cell and neuronal growth and morphology; molecular transport, quantity, and production of steroid hormones; and neurotransmission with an emphasis on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axes.

Thus, we determined the effects of MXC and VIN on the dysregulation of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in WB-F344 rat liver epithelial cells. Both chemicals induced a rapid dysregulation of GJIC at non-cytotoxic doses, with 30 min EC50 values for GJIC inhibition being 10 µM for MXC and 126 µM for VIN. MXC inhibited GJIC for at least 24 h, while VIN effects were transient and GJIC recovered after 4 h. VIN induced rapid hyperphosphorylation and internalization of gap junction protein connexin43, and both chemicals also activated MAPK ERK1/2 and p38. Effects on GJIC were not prevented by MEK1/2 inhibitor, but by an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), resveratrol, and in the case of VIN, also, by a p38 inhibitor. Estrogen (ER) and androgen receptor (AR) modulators (estradiol, ICI 182,780, HPTE, testosterone, flutamide, VIN M2) did not attenuate MXC or VIN effects on GJIC. Our data also indicate that the effects were elicited by the parental compounds of MXC and VIN. Our study provides new evidence that MXC and VIN dysregulate GJIC via mechanisms involving rapid activation of PC-PLC occurring independently of ER- or AR-dependent genomic signaling. Such alterations of rapid intercellular and intracellular signaling events involved in regulations of gene expression, tissue development, function and homeostasis, could also contribute to transgenerational epigenetic effects of endocrine disruptors.",PMC5013879

To date however animal studies to investigate a direct causal have mainly focussed on supra-environmental BPA concentrations, without investigating the effect on the early embryo. In this study we investigated the effect of acute BPA exposure (days 3.5 to 7.5 post-fertilisation) at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 and 10 ng/mL) on in vitro bovine embryo development, quality and metabolism. We then examined whether culturing embryos in the presence of the oestrogen receptor inhibitor fulvestrant could negate effects of BPA and 17β-oestradiol (E2). Exposure to BPA or E2 (10 ng/mL) decreased blastocyst rate and the percentage of transferrable quality embryos, without affecting cell number, lineage allocation or metabolic gene expression compared to untreated embryos. Notably, blastocysts exposed to BPA and E2 (10 ng/mL) displayed an increase in glucose consumption. The presence of fulvestrant however negated the adverse developmental and metabolic effects, suggesting BPA elicits its effects via oestrogen-mediated pathways. This study demonstrates that even acute exposure to an environmentally relevant BPA concentration can affect early embryo development and metabolism. These may have long-term health consequences on an individual.",PMC4935887

However, exactly how BPA affects offspring fertility remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of gestational BPA exposure on sperm function, fertility, and proteome profile of F1 spermatozoa in adult mice. Pregnant CD-1 mice (F0) were gavaged with BPA at three different doses (50 μg/kg bw/day, 5 mg/kg bw/day, and 50 mg/kg bw/day) on embryonic days 7 to 14. We investigated the function, fertility, and related processes of F1 spermatozoa at postnatal day 120. We also evaluated protein profiles of F1 spermatozoa to monitor their functional affiliation to disease. BPA inhibited sperm count, motility parameters, and intracellular ATP levels in a dose-dependent manner. These effects appeared to be caused by reduced numbers of stage VIII seminiferous epithelial cells in testis and decreased protein kinase A (PKA) activity and tyrosine phosphorylation in spermatozoa. We also found that BPA compromised average litter size. Proteins differentially expressed in spermatozoa from BPA treatment groups are known to play a critical role in ATP generation, oxidative stress response, fertility, and in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Our study provides mechanistic support for the hypothesis that gestational exposure to BPA alters sperm function and fertility via down-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation through a PKA-dependent mechanism. In addition, we anticipate that the BPA-induced changes in the sperm proteome might be partly responsible for the observed effects in spermatozoa.

The present study examined the effects of TCC alone and in combination with the model endocrine disruptor 17β-trenbolone (TRB) on fish reproductive function. Adult Pimephales promelas were continuously exposed to either 1 µg TCC/L or 5 µg TCC/L, to 0.5 µg TRB/L, or to a mixture (MIX) of 5 µg TCC/L and 0.5 µg TRB/L for 22 d, and a variety of reproductive and endocrine-related endpoints were examined. Cumulative fecundity was significantly reduced in fathead minnows exposed to TRB, MIX, or 5 µg TCC/L. Exposure to 1 µg TCC/L had no effect on reproduction. In general, both TRB and MIX treatments caused similar physiological effects, evoking significant reductions in female plasma vitellogenin, estradiol, and testosterone, and significant increases in male plasma estradiol. Based on analysis of the ovarian transcriptome, there were potential pathway impacts that were common to both TRB- and TCC-containing treatment groups. In most cases, however, those pathways were more plausibly linked to differences in reproductive status than to androgen-specific functions. Overall, TCC was reproductively toxic to fish at concentrations at or near those that have been measured in surface water. There was little evidence that TCC elicits reproductive toxicity through a specific mode of endocrine or reproductive action, nor that it could augment the androgenic effects of TRB.

Separate regression models were composed for each combination, in which exposure levels were classified in tertiles. Both whole population and sex-stratified analyses were performed. A family history of ADHD, the educational level, smoking or using alcohol or illicit drugs during pregnancy were considered as confounders. In total, data from 76 mother-child pairs was included. No significant associations were found between prenatal PFAS exposure and ADHD scores in the whole population and in the sex-stratified analyses. With regard to externalizing behavior, a significant negative association was found between the highest levels of ΣPFAS exposure and externalizing problem behavior in the whole population, but only in the crude model. After stratifying for sex, boys in the second and third tertile of exposure to PFOA presented significantly lower scores on the Externalizing Problem Scale than boys with the lowest exposure levels in the adjusted model. Girls exposed to higher levels of ΣPFAS exposure (T2) showed significantly lower scores on the Externalizing Problem Scale, in both crude and adjusted models. No significant associations with PFOS were found. RESULTS from the current study show that prenatal exposure to PFOA was negatively related to externalizing behavior in boys. RESULTS were different for boys and girls, emphasizing that mechanisms at work might be sex-dependent. However, results should be interpreted with caution as the sample size was small.",PMC4881136

Inland silversides (Menidia beryllina) at an early stage of development [12 days posthatch (dph)] were exposed to waters from two estuarine wastewater-treatment outfall locations in a tidal estuary, the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta (California, USA) that had varied hydrology and input volumes. The genomic response caused by endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in these waters was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction on a suite of hormonally regulated genes. Relative androgenic and estrogenic activities of the waters were measured using CALUX reporter bioassays. The presence of bifenthrin, a pyrethroid pesticide and known EDC, as well as caffeine and the anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical ibuprofen, which were used as markers of wastewater effluent input, were determined using instrumental analysis. Detectable levels of bifenthrin (2.89 ng L(-1)) were found on one of the sampling dates, and caffeine was found on all sampling dates, in water from the Boynton Slough. Neither compound was detected at the Carquinez Strait site, which has a much smaller effluent discharge input volume relative to the receiving water body size compared with Boynton Slough. Water samples from both sites incubated in the CALUX cell line induced estrogenic and androgenic activity in almost all instances, though the estrogenicity was relatively higher than the androgenicity. Changes in the abundance of mRNA transcripts of endocrine-responsive genes and indicators of general chemical stress were observed after a 96-h exposure to waters from both locations. The relative levels of endocrine response, changes in gene transcript abundance, and contaminant concentrations were greater in water from the Boynton Slough site despite those effluents undergoing a more advanced treatment process. The availability of a widely geographically distributed estuarine model species (M. beryllina) now allows for improved assessment of treated effluent impacts across brackish, estuarine, and marine environments.",PMC7938872

Reports have shown that TCS is a potential endocrine disruptor; however, the potential effects of TCS on placental endocrine function are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the endocrine disrupting effects of TCS on the placenta in pregnant rats. Pregnant rats from gestational day (GD) 6 to GD 20 were treated with 0, 30, 100, 300 and 600 mg/kg/d TCS followed by analysis of various biochemical parameters. Of the seven tissues examined, the greatest bioaccumulation of TCS was observed in the placenta. Reduction of gravid uterine weight and the occurrence of abortion were observed in the 600 mg/kg/d TCS-exposed group. Moreover, hormone detection demonstrated that the serum levels of progesterone (P), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and prolactin (PRL) were decreased in groups exposed to higher doses of TCS. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) analysis revealed a significant increase in mRNA levels for placental steroid metabolism enzymes, including UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), estrogen sulfotransferase 1E1 (SULT1E1), steroid 5α-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) and steroid 5α-reductase 2 (SRD5A2). Furthermore, the transcriptional expression levels of progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ERα) and androgen receptor (AR) were up-regulated. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the placenta was a target tissue of TCS and that TCS induced inhibition of circulating steroid hormone production might be related to the altered expression of hormone metabolism enzyme genes in the placenta. This hormone disruption might subsequently affect fetal development and growth.",PMC4858197

Although TCS has been shown to alter fetal physiology, its effects in the developing fetal brain are unknown. We hypothesize that exposure to TCS during fetal life could affect fetal hypothalamic gene expression. The objective of this study was to use transcriptomics and systems analysis to identify significantly altered biological processes in the late gestation ovine fetal hypothalamus after direct or indirect exposure to low doses of TCS. For direct TCS exposure, chronically catheterized late gestation fetal sheep were infused with vehicle (n = 4) or TCS (250 μg/d; n = 4) iv. For indirect TCS exposure, TCS (100 μg/kg · d; n = 3) or vehicle (n = 3) was infused into the maternal circulation. Fetal hypothalami were collected after 2 days of infusion, and gene expression was measured through microarray. Hierarchical clustering of all samples according to gene expression profiles showed that samples from the TCS-treated animals clustered apart from the controls. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that fetal hypothalamic genes stimulated by maternal and fetal TCS infusion were significantly enriching for cell cycle, reproductive process, and feeding behavior, whereas the inhibited genes were significantly enriching for chromatin modification and metabolism of steroids, lipoproteins, fatty acids, and glucose (P < .05). In conclusion, short-term infusion of TCS induces vigorous changes in the fetal hypothalamic transcriptomics, which are mainly related to food intake pathways and metabolism. If these changes persist to postnatal life, they could result in adverse consequences in adulthood.",PMC4929550

However, beneficial effects of RVT against early exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have not been understood. EDCs are linked to several ovarian diseases such as premature ovarian failure, polycystic ovary syndrome, early menopause and infertility in women. Hexavalent chromium (CrVI) is a heavy metal EDC, and widely used in >50 industries. Environmental contamination with CrVI in the US is rapidly increasing, predisposing the human to several illnesses including cancers and still birth. Our lab has been involved in determining the molecular mechanism of CrVI-induced female infertility and intervention strategies to mitigate CrVI effects. Lactating mother rats were exposed to CrVI (50ppm potassium dichromate) from postpartum days 1-21 through drinking water with or without RVT (10mg/kg body wt., through oral gavage daily). During this time, F1 females received respective treatments through mother's milk. On postnatal day (PND) 25, blood and the ovary, kidney and liver were collected from the F1 females for analyses. CrVI increased atresia of follicles by increasing cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3; decreasing antiapoptotic proteins; decreasing estradiol (E2) biosynthesis and enhancing metabolic clearance of E2, increasing oxidative stress and decreasing endogenous antioxidants. RVT mitigated the effects of CrVI by upregulating cell survival proteins and AOXs; and restored E2 levels by inhibiting hydroxylation, glucuronidation and sulphation of E2. This is the first study to report the protective effects of RVT against any toxicant in the ovary.",PMC5830085

Thus, it is important to characterize BPA levels, metabolic fate and sources of exposure in pregnant women. We used an improved liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analytic method to directly and simultaneously measure unconjugated BPA (uBPA), BPA glucuronide and BPA sulfate in the urine of a population of ethnically and racially diverse, and predominately low-income pregnant women (n = 112) in their second trimester. We also administered a questionnaire on dietary and non-dietary sources of exposure to BPA. We found universal and high exposure to uBPA and its metabolites: median concentrations were 0.25, 4.67, and 0.31 μg/g creatinine for uBPA, BPA glucuronide, and BPA sulfate, respectively. The median Total BPA (uBPA + BPA in glucuronide and sulfate forms) level was more than twice that measured in U.S. pregnant women in NHANES 2005-2006, while 30 % of the women had Total BPA levels above the 95th percentile. On average, Total BPA consisted of 71 % BPA in glucuronide form, 15 % BPA in sulfate form and 14 % uBPA, however the proportion of BPA in sulfate form increased and the proportion of uBPA decreased with Total BPA levels. Occupational and non-occupational contact with paper receipts was positively associated with BPA in conjugated (glucuronidated + sulfated) form after adjustment for demographic characteristics. Recent consumption of foods and beverages likely to be contaminated with BPA was infrequent among participants and we did not observe any positive associations with BPA analyte levels. The high levels of BPA analytes found in our study population may be attributable to the low-income status of the majority of participants and/or our direct analytic method, which yields a more complete evaluation of BPA exposure. We observed near-universal exposure to BPA among pregnant women, as well as substantial variability in BPA metabolic clearance, raising additional concerns for effects on fetal development. Our results are consistent with studies showing thermal paper receipts to be an important source of exposure, point to the difficulty pregnant women have avoiding BPA exposure on an individual level, and therefore underscore the need for changes in BPA regulation and commerce.",PMC4828888

In contrast with previous studies, we examined the full range of clinical risk factors known to affect fetal growth as potential confounders, as well as other environmental pollutants that are likely to interact with fetal growth (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury, lead, cadmium and manganese). There was no statistically significant relationship between PBDE levels in early pregnancy and birth weight in both unadjusted and multivariate regression models.

This study was conducted to assess the transfer of ΣDDT from PV-sediment into polychaetes (Neanthes arenaceodentata) and hornyhead turbot, and to investigate if the responses in turbots from two different laboratory exposures mimic those in turbots caught in PV (PV-turbot). Turbot fed PV-sediment-contaminated polychaete for 7 days had liver concentrations of ΣDDT similar to PV-turbot. After 28 days, ΣDDT also accumulated in livers of turbot gavaged with a ΣDDT mixture. In vitro cell bioassays indicated significant increases of 17β-estradiol equivalents (EEQ) in turbot bile extracts as compared to the control in the 7-day study. These responses corresponded to those measured in PV-fish. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR), anti-androgen receptor (anti-AR), estrogen receptor (ER) or aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activities were also observed in extracts of PV-sediment, and PV-sediment-exposed worm. Anti-AR, AhR and GR activities were significantly higher in PV-sediment than reference sediment (San Diego, SD). Higher transcripts of hepatic VTG, ERα and ERβ were found in PV-turbot than SD-turbot, but were unaltered in fish exposed to sediment-contaminated worms for the 7-day study. In contrast, liver extracts from the 28-day treatment of ΣDDT showed lower EEQ but similar hepatic VTG and ERβ transcripts relative to those of PV-turbot. These data indicated that trophic transfer of sediment-associated DDT in 7-day exposures corresponded to field measurements of DDT residues and in vitro ER bioactivities, but failed to mimic in vivo biological effects observed in field fish.

A targeted and untargeted approach using overrepresentation analysis (ORA), quantitative enrichment analysis (QEA) and pathway analysis (PA) and a metabolite network approach were compared. Any untargeted approach necessarily has some noise in the data owing to artifacts, outliers and misidentified metabolites. Depending on the chemical analytical choices (sample extraction, chromatography, instrument and settings, etc.), only a partial representation of all metabolites will be achieved, biased by both the analytical methods and the database used to identify the metabolites. Here, we show on the one hand that using a data analysis approach based exclusively on pathway annotations has the potential to miss much that is of interest and, in the case of misidentified metabolites, can produce perturbed pathways that are statistically significant yet uninformative for the biological sample at hand. On the other hand, a targeted approach, by narrowing its focus and minimizing (but not eliminating) misidentifications, renders the likelihood of a spurious pathway much smaller, but the limited number of metabolites also makes statistical significance harder to achieve. To avoid an analysis dependent on pathways, we built a de novo network using all metabolites that were different at 24 h with and without estrogen with a p value <0.01 (53) in the STITCH database, which links metabolites based on known reactions in the main metabolic network pathways but also based on experimental evidence and text mining. The resulting network contained a ""connected component"" of 43 metabolites and helped identify non-endogenous metabolites as well as pathways not visible by annotation-based approaches. Moreover, the most highly connected metabolites (energy metabolites such as pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate, as well as amino acids) showed only a modest change between proliferation with and without estrogen. Here, we demonstrate that estrogen has subtle but potentially phenotypically important alterations in the acyl-carnitine fatty acids, acetyl-putrescine and succinoadenosine, in addition to likely subtle changes in key energy metabolites that, however, could not be verified consistently given the technical limitations of this approach. Finally, we show that a network-based approach combined with text mining identifies pathways that would otherwise neither be considered statistically significant on their own nor be identified via ORA, QEA, or PA.",PMC5047848

We quantified four phenol biomarkers in third trimester maternal spot urine samples in a cohort of women enrolled in New York City between 1998 and 2002 and evaluated fat mass in their children using a Tanita scale between ages 4 and 9years (173 children with 351 total observations). We estimated associations of standard deviation differences in natural log creatinine-standardized phenol biomarker concentrations with percent fat mass using linear mixed effects regression models. We did not observe associations of bisphenol A or triclosan with childhood percent fat mass.

Total PCBs also showed a marginal association with increasing cMetS score from the baseline. Of the metabolic components, change in diastolic BP over time showed a notable association with specific PCBs, but no association with organochlorine pesticides.

26934298,"Ulrike Klenke, Stephanie Constantin, Susan Wray",BPA Directly Decreases GnRH Neuronal Activity via Noncanonical Pathway.,2016,"Peripheral feedback of gonadal estrogen to the hypothalamus is critical for reproduction. Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental pollutant with estrogenic actions, can disrupt this feedback and lead to infertility in both humans and animals. GnRH neurons are essential for reproduction, serving as an important link between brain, pituitary, and gonads. Because GnRH neurons express several receptors that bind estrogen, they are potential targets for endocrine disruptors. However, to date, direct effects of BPA on GnRH neurons have not been shown. This study investigated the effects of BPA on GnRH neuronal activity using an explant model in which large numbers of primary GnRH neurons are maintained and express many of the receptors found in vivo. Because oscillations in intracellular calcium have been shown to correlate with electrical activity in GnRH neurons, calcium imaging was used to assay the effects of BPA. Exposure to 50μM BPA significantly decreased GnRH calcium activity. Blockage of γ-aminobutyric acid ergic and glutamatergic input did not abrogate the inhibitory BPA effect, suggesting direct regulation of GnRH neurons by BPA. In addition to estrogen receptor-β, single-cell RT-PCR analysis confirmed that GnRH neurons express G protein-coupled receptor 30 (G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1) and estrogen-related receptor-γ, all potential targets for BPA.

We tested the endocrine disruption of co-formulants in six glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH), the most used pesticides worldwide. All co-formulants and formulations were comparably cytotoxic well below the agricultural dilution of 1% (18-2000 times for co-formulants, 8-141 times for formulations), and not the declared active ingredient glyphosate (G) alone. The endocrine-disrupting effects of all these compounds were measured on aromatase activity, a key enzyme in the balance of sex hormones, below the toxicity threshold. Aromatase activity was decreased both by the co-formulants alone (polyethoxylated tallow amine-POEA and alkyl polyglucoside-APG) and by the formulations, from concentrations 800 times lower than the agricultural dilutions; while G exerted an effect only at 1/3 of the agricultural dilution. It was demonstrated for the first time that endocrine disruption by GBH could not only be due to the declared active ingredient but also to co-formulants. These results could explain numerous in vivo results with GBHs not seen with G alone; moreover, they challenge the relevance of the acceptable daily intake (ADI) value for GBHs exposures, currently calculated from toxicity tests of the declared active ingredient alone.",PMC4808927

Yet although knowledge on the biological effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms is increasing, far less is known about how ecologically-important interspecific interactions are affected by chemicals. In particular, the consequences of anthropogenic pollution for the interaction of hosts and parasites are poorly understood. Here, we examine how exposure to 17β-oestradiol (E2)-a natural oestrogen and a model endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) -affects infection susceptibility and emergent infection phenotypes in an experimental host-parasite system; three spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) infected with the common, debilitating cestode Schistocephalus solidus. We exposed individual sticklebacks to a 0ngl(-1) (control), 10ngl(-1) or 100ngl(-1) E2 treatment before feeding them infective stages of S. solidus. E2 exposure significantly elevated vitellogenin (VTG) levels-a biomarker of exposure to xenoestrogens-in both female and male fish, and reduced their body condition. Susceptibility to parasite infection was unaffected by EDC exposure; however, E2 treatment and fish sex interacted significantly to determine the growth rate of parasites, which grew quickest in male hosts held under the higher (100ngl(-1)) E2 treatment. Tissue VTG levels and parasite mass correlated positively across the whole sample of experimentally infected fish, but separate regressions run on the male and female datasets demonstrated a significant relationship only among male fish. Hence, among males-but not females-elevated VTG levels elicited by E2 exposure led to more rapid parasite growth. We outline plausible physiological mechanisms that could explain these results. Our results demonstrate that oestrogenic pollutants can alter host-parasite interactions by promoting parasite growth, and that male hosts may be disproportionately affected. Because ecologically-relevant effects of infection on host antipredator responses, growth, energetics and reproductive development all depend on parasite mass in this host-parasite system, our results indicate that EDCs can mediate the ecological consequences of infections. We therefore consider the implications of our results for the ecology of hosts and parasites in polluted environments.",PMC4827130

BPA exposure in utero has been linked to breast cancer and abnormal mammary gland development in mice. The recent rise in incidence of human breast cancer and decreased age of first detection suggests a possible environmental etiology. We hypothesized that developmental programming of carcinogenesis may involve an aberrant immune response. Both innate and adaptive immunity play a role in tumor suppression through cytolytic CD8, NK, and Th1 T-cells. We hypothesized that BPA exposure in utero would lead to dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immunity in the mammary gland. CD1 mice were exposed to BPA in utero during gestation (days 9-21) via osmotic minipump. At 6 weeks, the female offspring were ovariectomized and estradiol was given at 8 weeks. RNA and protein were extracted from the posterior mammary glands, and the mRNA and protein levels were measured by PCR array, qRT-PCR, and western blot. In mouse mammary tissue, BPA exposure in utero significantly decreased the expression of members of the chemokine CXC family (Cxcl2, Cxcl4, Cxcl14, and Ccl20), interleukin 1 (Il1) gene family (Il1β and Il1rn), interleukin 2 gene family (Il7 receptor), and interferon gene family (interferon regulatory factor 9 (Irf9), as well as immune response gene 1 (Irg1). Additionally, BPA exposure in utero decreased Esr1 receptor gene expression and increased Esr2 receptor gene expression. In utero exposure of BPA resulted in significant changes to inflammatory modulators within mammary tissue. We suggest that dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory, leads to a microenvironment that may promote disordered cell growth through inhibition of the immune response that targets cancer cells.",PMC10726733

Effects on oocyte growth and maturation, autophagy and apoptosis processes, histone modifications, and DNA methylation were assessed by Real-Time PCR (qPCR), histology, and chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with qPCR analysis (ChIP-qPCR). The results showed that 5 μg/L BPA down-regulated oocyte maturation-promoting signals, likely through changes in the chromatin structure mediated by histone modifications, and promoted apoptosis in mature follicles. These data indicate that the negative effects of BPA on the female reproductive system may be due to its upstream ability to deregulate epigenetic mechanism.",PMC4766405

TCS is suspected of having endocrine-disrupting properties, but few human studies have examined the developmental effects of prenatal TCS exposure. We prospectively examined associations between prenatal TCS exposure and anthropometric measures at birth and anogenital distance (AGD) at 3 months of age. Pregnant women from the Odense Child Cohort (n = 514) provided urine samples at approximately gestational week 28 (median 28.7 weeks, range 26.4-34.0), and urinary TCS concentration was measured by isotope dilution TurboFlow-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to examine associations between prenatal TCS exposure and measures of size at birth (birth weight, length, head and abdominal circumference) and AGD at 3 months of age (median 3.3 months, range 2.3-6.7 months), controlling for potential confounders. Newborn boys in the highest quartile of prenatal TCS exposure had a 0.7-cm [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.2, -0.1, p = 0.01] smaller head circumference than boys in the lowest quartile. Additionally in boys, inverse associations of borderline statistical significance were observed between prenatal TCS exposure and abdominal circumference at birth and AGD at 3 months of age (p-values < 0.10). Prenatal TCS exposure was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes in girls. However, AGD was measured in fewer girls, and we observed no significant interactions between a child's sex and prenatal TCS exposure in anthropometric measures at birth. Prenatal TCS exposure was associated with reduced head and abdominal circumference at birth and with reduced AGD at 3 months of age in boys, although the last two findings were statistically nonsignificant.

However, exposure to endocrine disruptors during organogenesis may lead to deleterious and permanent problems later in life. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) transgenic lines expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in specific organs and tissues are powerful tools to uncover developmental defects elicited by EDCs. Here, we used seven transgenic lines to visualize in vivo whether a series of EDCs and other pharmaceutical compounds can alter organogenesis in zebrafish. We used transgenic lines expressing GFP in pancreas, liver, blood vessels, inner ear, nervous system, pharyngeal tooth and pectoral fins. This screen revealed that four of the tested chemicals have detectable effects on different organs, which shows that the range of effects elicited by EDCs is wider than anticipated. The endocrine disruptor tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA), as well as the three drugs diclofenac, trichostatin A (TSA) and valproic acid (VPA) induced abnormalities in the embryonic vascular system of zebrafish. Moreover, TSA and VPA induced specific alterations during the development of pancreas, an observation that was confirmed by in situ hybridization with specific markers. Developmental delays were also induced by TSA and VPA in the liver and in pharyngeal teeth, resulting in smaller organ size.

Of totally 10 key photo-transduction cascade genes analyzed, transcriptional levels of most were significantly up-regulated, or normal down-regulation was attenuated. Similarly, for some circadian rhythm genes, dose-dependent transcriptional alterations were also observed in the totally 33 genes analyzed. Significant alterations occurred even at environmental relevant levels of 7 ng/L P4. Different patterns were observed for these transcriptional alterations, of which, the nfil3 family displayed most significant changes.

Intensive farming and weather events, such as storms, flash flooding, and landslides, contribute estrogen to waterways used to supply drinking water. This paper explores the impact of estrogen exposure on the performance of slow sand filters (SSFs) used for water treatment. The feasibility and efficacy of SSF bioaugmentation with estrogen-degrading bacteria was also investigated, to determine whether removal of natural estrogens (estrone, estradiol, and estriol) and overall SSF performance for drinking water treatment could be improved. Strains for SSF augmentation were isolated from full-scale, municipal SSFs so as to optimize survival in the laboratory-scale SSFs used. Concentrations of the natural estrogens, determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), revealed augmented SSFs reduced the overall estrogenic potency of the supplied water by 25% on average and removed significantly more estrone and estradiol than nonaugmented filters. A negative correlation was found between coliform removal and estrogen concentration in nonaugmented filters. This was due to the toxic inhibition of protozoa, indicating that high estrogen concentrations can have functional implications for SSFs (such as impairing coliform removal). Consequently, we suggest that high estrogen concentrations could impact significantly on water quality production and, in particular, on pathogen removal in biological water filters.",PMC4841604

Mouse dams were treated with 500 mg·kg·d of BBP or vehicle on gestation days 9-16. Pups were weaned and analyzed for voluntary physical activity levels, puberty development, sex hormone levels, and body composition during the 20-wk period. Seventy-three offspring from BBP-treated dams were studied (n = 43 males and n = 30 females).

Further, there was a significant decrease in serum testosterone concentration in male mice between control and BBP at 10 wk (P = 0.039) and at 20 wk (P = 0.022). In female mice, there was a significant increase in serum testosterone concentration in BBP mice at 20 wk (P = 0.002) and a significant increase in estrogen (estradiol) concentrations at 20 wk in the control female mice (P = 0.015). Overall, BBP mice ran significantly less distance (males, P = 0.008; females, P = 0.042) than controls. Other than a significant increase in BBP-treated males in fat mass at 20 wk (P = 0.040), there was no significant decrease in weight, lean mass, or fat mass in either female or male mice, regardless of treatment.

Reproductive function, histopathology, hormone levels, offspring morphology, and the ovarian transcriptome were assessed. Embryonic atrazine exposure resulted in a significant increase in progesterone levels in the 3 and 30 ppb groups. A significant decrease in spawning and a significant increase in follicular atresia in the 30 ppb group were observed. In offspring, a decrease in the head length to body ratio in the 30 ppb group, along with a significant increase in head width to body ratio in the 0.3 and 3 ppb groups occurred.

The LINC study is a prospective birth cohort designed to study associations between early life environmental exposures and child health, including growth and neurodevelopment. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of this cohort. Recruitment for this cohort has started in 2011 in three Dutch areas and is still ongoing. To date over 300 mother-child pairs have been included. Women are preferably included during the first trimester of pregnancy. Major congenital anomalies and twin births are reasons for exclusion. To assess exposure to environmental chemicals, cord blood, placenta, meconium and vernix are collected. Parents collect urine of the child shortly after birth and breast milk in the second month of life. Exposure to a broad range of environmental chemicals are determined in cord plasma and breast milk. Furthermore various hormones, including leptin and cortisone, are determined in cord plasma, and in heel prick blood spots (thyroxine). Data on anthropometry of the child is collected through midwives and youth health care centres on various time points until the child is 18 months of age. Furthermore cognitive development is monitored by means of the van Wiechen scheme, and information on behavioral development is collected by means of the infant behavior questionnaire and the child behavior checklist.

Most of the biomarker genes were shown to be directly regulated by ERα as determined by ESR1 gene knockdown using siRNA as well as through chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing analysis of ERα-DNA interactions. The biomarker was evaluated as a predictive tool using the fold-change rank-based Running Fisher algorithm by comparison to annotated gene expression datasets from experiments using MCF-7 cells, including those evaluating the transcriptional effects of hormones and chemicals. Using 141 comparisons from chemical- and hormone-treated cells, the biomarker gave a balanced accuracy for prediction of ERα activation or suppression of 94% and 93%, respectively.

Newborn male mice were subcutaneously injected with BPA (0.01, 0.1 and 5 mg/kg body weight) daily from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 21. Histological analysis of testes at PND 22 revealed that BPA-treated testes contained mostly spermatogonia and spermatocytes with markedly less round spermatids, indicating signs of meiotic arrest. Terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that BPA treatment significantly increased the number of apoptotic germ cells per tubule, which corroborated the observation of meiotic arrest. In addition, BPA caused abnormal proliferation of germ cells as revealed by Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemical staining. Mechanistically, BPA-treated testes displayed a complete lack of BOULE expression, which is a conserved key regulator for spermatogenesis. Moreover, BPA significantly increased the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) α and β in the developing testis.

Thus, we investigated the effects of direct DEHP exposure on antral follicle growth in pre-pubescent mice by use of intraperitoneal injection. Our results demonstrated that the percentage of large antral follicles was significantly reduced when mice were exposed to 20 or 40 μg/kg DEHP every 5 days from postnatal day 0 (0 dpp) to 15 dpp. In 20 dpp, we performed microarray of these ovaries. The microarray results indicated that mRNA levels of apoptosis related genes were increased. The mRNA levels of the apoptosis and cell proliferation (negative) related genes Apoe, Agt, Glo1 and Grina were increased after DEHP exposure. DEHP induced the differential gene expression of Hsp90ab1, Rhoa, Grina and Xdh which may play an important role in this process. In addition, TUNEL staining and immunofluorescence showed that DEHP exposure significantly increased the number of TUNEL, Caspase3 and γH2AX positive ovarian somatic cells within the mouse ovaries. Flow cytometer analyses of redox-sensitive probes showed that DEHP caused the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, the mRNA expression of ovarian somatic cell antioxidative enzymes was down-regulated both in vivo and in vitro.

Treatment with 2,4-D markedly decreased testicular testosterone in wild-type mice, leading to degeneration of spermatocytes and Sertoli cells. The 2,4-D decreased cholesterol levels in Leydig cells of wild-type mice through down-regulating the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase 1 and reductase, involved in de novo cholesterogenesis. However, the mRNAs encoding the important proteins involved in testosterone synthesis were unchanged by 2,4-D except for CYP17A1, indicating that exhausted cholesterol levels in the cells is a main reason for reduced testicular testosterone. Additionally, pregnancy rate and the number of pups between 2,4-D-treated wild-type male mice and untreated female mice were significantly lower compared with those between untreated couples. These phenomena were not observed in 2,4-D-treated Ppara-null males.

E2 decreased expression of Lhb, Fshb, and Icam5 mRNA in females but only significantly decreased expression of Icam5 in males. BPA decreased expression of Icam5 similarly to E2, but it did not affect Lhb or Fshb. Importantly, in vivo exposure to 50-μg/kg · d E2 from PND0 to PND7 decreased expression of Lhb, Fshb, and Icam5 mRNA in both males and females, whereas 50-mg/kg · d BPA exposure during the same time frame decreased expression of Icam5 in females only. Overall, we have uncovered that genes differentially expressed between the sexes can be regulated in part by hormonal and chemical signals in vivo and directly at the pituitary and can be regulated in a sex-specific manner.",PMC4816737

It is known that hormonal imbalance may disrupt its development predisposing this gland to develop diseases during aging. Although the hypothesis regarding earlier origins of prostate diseases was proposed many years ago, the mechanisms underlying this complex phenomenon are poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prostates of old male gerbils exposed to testosterone during intrauterine and postnatal life using morphological, biometrical, stereological, Kariometric, immunohistochemical, and immunofluorescence analyses. Our findings demonstrate that prenatal and pubertal exposure to testosterone increases the susceptibility to the development of prostate diseases during aging. The presence of a more proliferative gland associated with foci of adenomatous hyperplasia in animals exposed to testosterone during the prenatal and pubertal phase show that the utero life and the pubertal period are important phases for prostatic morphophysiology establishment, which is a determinant for the health of the gland during aging. Therefore, these findings reinforce the idea that prostate disease may result from hormonal disruptions in early events during prostate development, which imprint permanently on the gland predisposing it to develop lesions in later stages of life.",PMC5312212

Consequently, there is a need for flexible, widely-applicable, biologically-based models that can predict changes in fecundity in response to chemical exposures, based on readily measured biochemical endpoints, such as plasma vitellogenin (VTG) concentrations, as input parameters. Herein we describe a MATLAB® version of an oocyte growth dynamics model for fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) with a graphical user interface based upon a previously published model developed with MCSim software and evaluated with data from fathead minnows exposed to an androgenic chemical, 17β-trenbolone. We extended the evaluation of our new model to include six chemicals that inhibit enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis: fadrozole, ketoconazole, propiconazole, prochloraz, fenarimol, and trilostane. In addition, for unexposed fathead minnows from group spawning design studies, and those exposed to the six chemicals, we evaluated whether the model is capable of predicting the average number of eggs per spawn and the average number of spawns per female, which was not evaluated previously. The new model is significantly improved in terms of ease of use, platform independence, and utility for providing output in a format that can be used as input into a population dynamics model. Model-predicted minimum and maximum cumulative fecundity over time encompassed the observed data for fadrozole and most propiconazole, prochloraz, fenarimol and trilostane treatments, but did not consistently replicate results from ketoconazole treatments. For average fecundity (eggs•female(-1)•day(-1)), eggs per spawn, and the number of spawns per female, the range of model-predicted values generally encompassed the experimentally observed values. Overall, we found that the model predicts reproduction metrics robustly and its predictions capture the variability in the experimentally observed data.",PMC4710531

Many studies indicate that high-doses of DBP and/or MBP exhibit toxicity on testicular function, however, little attention have been paid to the effects of low levels of DBP/MBP on steroidogenesis. As we all know, the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is a key regulator involved in the steroidogenesis. Here we found that, in addition to StAR, MBP/DBP increased the steroidogenesis by a cytoskeletal protein, vimentin. Briefly, in murine adrenocortical tumor (Y1) and the mouse Leydig tumor (MLTC-1) cells, vimentin regulated the secretion of progesterone. When these two cells were exposure to MBP, the DNA demethylation in the vimentin promoter was observed. In addition, MBP also induced the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB, a transcriptional regulator of vimentin). These two processes improved the transcriptional elevation of vimentin. Knockdown of NF-κB/vimentin signaling blocked the DBP/MBP-induced steroidogenesis. These in vitro results were also confirmed via an in vivo model. By identifying a mechanism whereby DBP/MBP regulates vimentin, our results expand the understanding of the endocrine disrupting potential of phthalate esters.",PMC4706347

Second trimester sex differences in AGD are broadly consistent with neonatal and infant measures of AGD and maternal cigarette smoking is associated with a temporary increase in male AGD in the absence of changes in circulating testosterone. AGD is a biomarker of fetal androgen exposure, a reduced AGD in males being associated with cryptorchidism, hypospadias and reduced penile length. Normative fetal AGD data remain partial and windows of sensitivity of human fetal AGD to disruption are not known. The effects of fetal sex and maternal cigarette smoking on the second trimester (11-21 weeks of gestation) human fetal AGD were studied, along with measurement of testosterone and testicular transcripts associated with apoptosis and proliferation. AGD, measured from the centre of the anus to the posterior/caudal root of penis/clitoris (AGD(app)) was determined in 56 female and 70 male morphologically normal fetuses. These data were integrated with current literature on perinatal AGD in humans. At 11-13 weeks of gestation male fetal AGD(app) was 61% (P< 0.001) longer than in females, increasing to 70% at 17-21 weeks. This sexual dimorphism was independent of growth characteristics (fetal weight, length, gonad weight). We confirmed that at 14-16 weeks of gestation male fetal AGD(app) was increased 28% (P < 0.05) by in utero cigarette smoke exposure. Testosterone levels were not affected by smoking. To develop normative data, our findings have been integrated with available data from in vivo ultrasound scans and neonatal studies. Inter-study variations in male/female AGD differences lead to the conclusion that normalization and standardization approaches should be developed to enable confidence in comparing data from different perinatal AGD studies. Sex differences, and a smoking-dependent increase in male fetal AGD at 14-16 weeks, identified in a preliminary study, were confirmed with a larger number of fetuses. However, human fetal AGD should, be re-assessed once much larger numbers of fetuses have been studied and this should be integrated with more detailed analysis of maternal lifestyle. Direct study of human fetal genital tissues is required for further mechanistic insights. Fetal exposure to cigarette smoke chemicals is known to lead to reduced fertility in men and women.

Among these substances, endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) present a threat, although the environmental significance of these compounds remains largely unknown. To shed some light on this field, we assessed the effects of 17β-oestradiol on the growth, reproduction and formation of free radicals in Eisenia fetida. Although the observed effects on growth and survival were relatively weak, a strong impact on reproduction was observed (50.70% inhibition in 100 μg/kg of E2). We further demonstrated that the exposure of the earthworm Eisenia fetida to a contaminant of emerging concern, 17β-oestradiol (E2), significantly affected the molecules involved in antioxidant defence. Exposure to E2 results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the stimulation of antioxidant systems (metallothionein and reduced oxidized glutathione ratio) but not phytochelatins at both the mRNA and translated protein levels. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-imaging revealed the subcuticular bioaccumulation of oestradiol-3,4-quinone, altering the levels of local antioxidants in a time-dependent manner. The present study illustrates that although most invertebrates do not possess oestrogen receptors, these organisms can be affected by oestrogen hormones, likely reflecting free diffusion into the cellular microenvironment with subsequent degradation to molecules that undergo redox cycling, producing ROS, thereby increasing environmental contamination that also perilously affects keystone animals, forming lower trophic levels.",PMC4690593

BPA is an estrogenic chemical used in a variety of consumer products. Evidence points to interactions of BPA with the prevailing environment. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of prenatal exposure to BPA on postnatal metabolic outcomes, including insulin resistance, adipose tissue distribution, adipocyte morphometry, and expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissue as well as to assess whether postnatal overfeeding would exacerbate these effects. Findings indicate that prenatal BPA exposure leads to insulin resistance in adulthood in the first breeder cohort (study 1), but not in the second cohort (study 2), which is suggestive of potential differences in genetic susceptibility. BPA exposure induced adipocyte hypertrophy in the visceral fat depot without an accompanying increase in visceral fat mass or increased CD68, a marker of macrophage infiltration, in the subcutaneous fat depot. Cohens effect size analysis found the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat depot in the prenatal BPA-treated overfed group to be higher compared with the control-overfed group. Altogether, these results suggest that exposure to BPA during fetal life at levels found in humans can program metabolic outcomes that lead to insulin resistance, a forerunner of type 2 diabetes, with postnatal obesity failing to manifest any interaction with prenatal BPA relative to insulin resistance and adipocyte hypertrophy.",PMC4888526

These organizing effects may be disturbed by endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). To determine whether developmental exposure to Ethinylestradiol (EE2) may alter reproductive parameters in adult male mice and their progeny, Swiss mice (F1 generation) were exposed from prenatal to peripubertal periods to EE2 (0.1-1 μg/kg/d). Sexual behavior and reproductive physiology were evaluated on F1 males and their F2, F3 and F4 progeny. EE2-exposed F1 males and their F2 to F4 progeny exhibited EE2 dose-dependent increased sexual behavior, with reduced latencies of first mount and intromission, and higher frequencies of intromissions with a receptive female. The EE2 1 μg/kg/d exposed animals and their progeny had more calbindin immunoreactive cells in the medial preoptic area, known to be involved in the control of male sexual behavior in rodents. Despite neuroanatomical modifications in the Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone neuron population of F1 males exposed to both doses of EE2, no major deleterious effects on reproductive physiology were detected.

Reports of CPAs, which include hypospadias, chordee, micropenis, and ambiguous genitalia, have risen sharply in recent decades, but the causes of these malformations are rarely identified. Both genetic anomalies and environmental factors, such as antiandrogenic and estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are suspected to cause CPAs; however, little is known about the temporal window(s) of sensitivity to EDCs, or the tissue-specific roles and downstream targets of the androgen receptor (AR) in external genitalia. Here, we show that the full spectrum of CPAs can be produced by disrupting AR at different developmental stages and in specific cell types in the mouse genital tubercle. Inactivation of AR during a narrow window of prenatal development results in hypospadias and chordee, whereas earlier disruptions cause ambiguous genitalia and later disruptions cause micropenis. The neonatal phase of penile development is controlled by the balance of AR to estrogen receptor α (ERα) activity; either inhibition of androgen or augmentation of estrogen signaling can induce micropenis. AR and ERα have opposite effects on cell division, apoptosis, and regulation of Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein, and Wnt signaling in the genital tubercle. We identify Indian hedgehog (Ihh) as a novel downstream target of AR in external genitalia and show that conditional deletion of Ihh inhibits penile masculinization. These studies reveal previously unidentified cellular and molecular mechanisms by which antiandrogenic and estrogenic signals induce penile malformations and demonstrate that the timing of endocrine disruption can determine the type of CPA.",PMC4703017

The brain is particularly vulnerable to EDCs during critical periods of gestational development when gonadal hormones exert organizational effects on sexually dimorphic behaviors later in life. Peripubertal development is also a time of continued neural sensitivity to organizing effects of hormones, yet little is known about EDC actions at these times. We sought to determine effects of prenatal or juvenile exposures to a class of EDCs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at human-relevant dosages on development, physiology, and social and anxiety-related behaviors later in life, and the consequences of a second juvenile ""hit"" following prenatal treatment. We exposed male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to PCBs (Aroclor 1221, 1mg/kg/day, ip injection) and/or vehicle during prenatal development (embryonic days 16, 18, 20), juvenile development (postnatal days 24, 26, 28), or both. These exposures had differential effects on behaviors in sex and age-dependent ways; while prenatal exposure had more effects than juvenile, juvenile exposure often modified or unmasked the effects of the first hit. Additionally, females exhibited altered social and anxiety behavior in adolescence, while males displayed small but significant changes in sociosexual preferences in adulthood. Thus, the brain continues to be sensitive to organizing effects of EDCs through juvenile development. As humans are exposed to EDCs throughout multiple periods in their life, these findings have implications for our understanding of EDC effects on physiology and behavior.",PMC4718783

AGD, a sexually dimorphic index of prenatal androgen exposure, may also be altered by prenatal stress. How these exposures interact to impact AGD is unknown. Here, we examine the extent to which associations between prenatal phthalate exposure and infant AGD are modified by prenatal exposure to stressful life events (SLEs). Phthalate metabolites [including those of diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) and their molar sum (ΣDEHP)] were measured in first trimester urine from 738 pregnant women participating in The Infant Development and the Environment Study (TIDES).

Subjects were classified as 'lower' and 'higher' stress (0 first trimester SLEs vs. 1+).We estimated relationships between phthalate concentrations and AGD (by infant sex and stress group) using adjusted multiple regression interaction models. In the lower stress group, first trimester ΣDEHP was inversely associated with two measures of male AGD: anoscrotal distance (AGD-AS; β = -1.78; 95% CI -2.97, -0.59) and anopenile distance (AGD-AP; β = -1.61; 95% CI -3.01, -0.22). By contrast, associations in the higher stress group were mostly positive and non-significant in male infants. No associations were observed in girls.

In this context, the azole pesticides have earned special attention due to their cytochrome P450 aromatase inhibition potential. Cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19) catalyses the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into oestrone and oestradiol, respectively. Thus, aromatase modulates the oestrogenic balance essential not only for females, but also for male physiology, including gonadal function. Its inhibition affects reproductive organs, fertility and sexual behaviour in humans and wildlife species. Several studies have shown that azole pesticides are able to inhibit human and fish aromatases but the information on birds is lacking. Consequently, it appeared to be of interest to estimate the aromatase inhibition of azoles in three different avian species, namely Gallus gallus, Coturnix coturnix japonica and Taeniopygia guttata. In the absence of the crystal structure of the aromatase enzyme in these bird species, homology models for the individual avian species were constructed using the crystal structure of human aromatase (hAr) (pdb: 3EQM) that showed high sequence similarity for G. gallus (82.0%), T. guttata (81.9%) and C. japonica (81.2%). A homology model with Oncorhynchus mykiss (81.9%) was also designed for comparison purpose. The homology-modelled aromatase for each avian and fish species and crystal structure of human aromatase were selected for docking 46 structurally diverse azoles and related compounds. We showed that the docking behaviour of the chemicals on the different aromatases was broadly the same.

Serum and liver samples of exposed animals were analyzed on days 21, 50, 90, 140 and 200 in order to explore whether maternal exposure to BPA alters metabolism. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was independently applied to each time point, demonstrating a significant pair-wise discrimination for liver as well as serum samples at all time-points, and highlighting unequivocal metabolic shifts in rats perinatally exposed to BPA, including those exposed to lower doses. In BPA exposed animals, metabolism of glucose, lactate and fatty acids was modified over time. To further explore dynamic variation, ANOVA-Simultaneous Component Analysis (A-SCA) was used to separate data into blocks corresponding to the different sources of variation (Time, Dose and Time*Dose interaction). A-SCA enabled the demonstration of a dynamic, time/age dependent shift of serum metabolome throughout the rats' lifetimes. Variables responsible for the discrimination between groups clearly indicate that BPA modulates energy metabolism, and suggest alterations of neurotransmitter signaling, the latter finding being compatible with the neurodevelopmental effect of this xenoestrogen.

However, the effect of BPAF on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroidal (HPT) axis remains unknown. For elucidating the disruptive effects of BPAF on thyroid function and expression of the representative genes along the HPT axis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, whole-body total 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (TT3), total 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (TT4), free 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (FT3) and free 3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine (FT4) levels were examined following 168 h post-fertilization exposure to different BPAF concentrations (0, 5, 50 and 500 μg/L). The results showed that whole-body TT3, TT4, FT3 and FT4 contents decreased significantly with the BPAF treatment, indicating an endocrine disruption of thyroid. The expression of thyroid-stimulating hormone-β and thyroglobulin genes increased after exposing to 50 μg/L BPAF in seven-day-old larvae. The expressions of thyronine deiodinases type 1, type 2 and transthyretin mRNAs were also significantly up-regulated, which were possibly associated with a deterioration of thyroid function. However, slc5a5 gene transcription was significantly down-regulated at 50 μg/L and 500 μg/L BPAF exposure. Furthermore, trα and trβ genes were down-regulated transcriptionally after BPAF exposure. It demonstrates that BPAF exposure triggered thyroid endocrine toxicity by altering the whole-body contents of thyroid hormones and changing the transcription of the genes involved in the HPT axis in zebrafish larvae.",PMC4627017

Little is known about BPA in relation to thyroid volume and structure. We examined the association of BPA with thyroid volume and thyroid nodules using data from 718 Chinese children living in the East Coast of China in 2012. First morning urine samples were collected for the determination of urinary BPA, creatinine, and urinary iodine concentrations (UIC). Thyroid volume (TV) and nodules were assessed by thyroid ultrasonography. The median of TV was 3.14ml. 459(63.9%) children took iodized salt at home and the median of UIC was 159μg/l. BPA was detected in 99.9% of the urine samples and the medians for boys and girls were 2.64 and 2.35μg/g creatinine, respectively. Of all participants 14.0% had thyroid nodules. Urinary BPA concentration was inversely associated with thyroid volume (β = -0.033, 95% CI: -0.053, -0.013) and the risk for multiple nodules (OR = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.97). The associations above were similar for children who consumed iodized salt and those consumed non-iodized salt. The data suggest that BPA may be one of the influencing factors for TV and thyroid nodules and its effects are independent of iodine nutrition status in children.",PMC4619836

The effects of protracted exposure to BPA on the adult prostate have not been studied. We subjected Noble rats to 32 weeks of BPA (low or high dose) or 17β-estradiol (E2) in conjunction with T replenishment. T treatment alone or untreated groups were used as controls. Circulating T levels were maintained within the physiological range in all treatment groups, whereas the levels of free BPA were elevated in the groups treated with T+low BPA (1.06 ± 0.05 ng/mL, P < .05) and T+high BPA (10.37 ± 0.43 ng/mL, P < .01) when compared with those in both controls (0.1 ± 0.05 ng/mL). Prostatic hyperplasia, low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and marked infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the PIN epithelium (P < .05) were observed in the lateral prostates (LPs) of T+low/high BPA-treated rats. In contrast, only hyperplasia and high-grade PIN, but no aberrant immune responses, were found in the T+E2-treated LPs. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in LPs identified differential changes between T+BPA vs T+E2 treatment. Expression of multiple genes in the regulatory network controlled by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α was perturbed by the T+BPA but not by the T+E2 exposure. Collectively these findings suggest that the adult rat prostate, under a physiologically relevant T environment, is susceptible to BPA-induced transcriptomic reprogramming, immune disruption, and aberrant growth dysregulation in a manner distinct from those caused by E2. They are more relevant to our recent report of higher urinary levels BPA found in patients with prostate cancer than those with benign disease.",PMC4701889

However, the proximate effects of sex-role reversal are largely unknown. Endocrine disruptors provide an experimental mechanism to address hormonal regulation of sexually dimorphic gene expression in sex-role-reversed taxa. Here, we investigate gene expression patterns in the liver of the sex-role-reversed Gulf pipefish, because the liver is known to be sexually dimorphic and estrogen-regulated in species with conventional sex roles. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing technology (RNA-seq), we detected sexually dimorphic hepatic gene expression patterns, with a total of 482 differentially expressed genes between the sexes in Gulf pipefish. Two-thirds of these genes were over-expressed in females, and the sex-specific transcriptomes of this sex-role-reversed pipefish's liver were superficially similar to those of fishes with conventional sex-roles. We exposed females, pregnant males, and non-pregnant males to 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at ecologically relevant concentrations of 5ng/L and compared gene expression patterns in the livers of exposed fish to control fish. Several genes that were up-regulated in EE2-exposed males relative to control males were also found to be female-biased in control animals. These genes included several of the classic estrogen biomarkers, such as vitellogenin, choriogenin, and zona pellucida. Thus, estrogen exposure induced feminization of the male liver transcriptome in a sex-role-reversed pipefish. These results suggest that the ancestral state of estrogen-regulated female reproductive physiology has been retained in all sex-role-reversed vertebrates thus far studied, despite substantial evolution of the hormonal regulation of ornamentation and mating behavior in these interesting taxa.",PMC4598134

In the United States, blood PBDE levels in adults range from 30-100 ng/g- lipid but the alarming health concern revolves around children who have reported blood PBDE levels 3 to 9-fold higher than adults. PBDEs disrupt endocrine, immune, reproductive and nervous systems. However, the mechanism underlying its adverse health effect is not fully understood. Epigenetics is a possible biological mechanism underlying maternal exposure-child health outcomes by regulating gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence. We sought to examine the relationship between maternal exposure to environmental PBDEs and promoter methylation of a proinflammatory gene, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). We measured the maternal blood PBDE levels and cord blood TNFα promoter methylation levels on 46 paired samples of maternal and cord blood from the Boston Birth Cohort (BBC). We showed that decreased cord blood TNFα methylation associated with high maternal PBDE47 exposure. CpG site-specific methylation showed significantly hypomethylation in the girl whose mother has a high blood PBDE47 level.

The current study utilizes this model organism to provide insight into low-dose and long-term behavioral effects of BPA and bisphenol-S (BPS), a supposed safer replacement for BPA. Experiments presented in our report demonstrate that the effects of embryonic exposure to considerably low levels of BPA persist into adulthood, affecting neural functionality as assayed by measuring habituation to mechano-sensory stimuli in C. elegans. These results are noteworthy in that they are based on low-dose exposures, following the rationale that subtler effects that may not be morphologically apparent are likely to be discernible through behavioral changes. In addition, we report that embryonic exposure to BPS follows a pattern similar to BPA. Building upon previous observations using the C. elegans model, we have shown that exposure of embryos to BPA and BPS affects their behavior as adults. These long-term effects are in line with recommended alternate low-dose chemical safety testing approaches.

Recent evidence suggests that suburban landscapes harbor amphibian populations exhibiting similar levels of endocrine disruption; however the endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) sources are unknown. Here, we show that sex ratios of metamorphosing frogs become increasingly female-dominated along a suburbanization gradient. We further show that suburban ponds are frequently contaminated by the classical estrogen estrone and a variety of EDCs produced by plants (phytoestrogens), and that the diversity of organic EDCs is correlated with the extent of developed land use and cultivated lawn and gardens around a pond. Our work also raises the possibility that trace-element contamination associated with human land use around suburban ponds may be contributing to the estrogenic load within suburban freshwaters and constitutes another source of estrogenic exposure for wildlife. These data suggest novel, unexplored pathways of EDC contamination in human-altered environments. In particular, we propose that vegetation changes associated with suburban neighborhoods (e.g., from forests to lawns and ornamental plants) increase the distribution of phytoestrogens in surface waters. The result of frog sex ratios varying as a function of human land use implicates a role for environmental modulation of sexual differentiation in amphibians, which are assumed to only have genetic sex determination.

Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been found to suppress prostaglandin synthesis, but to our knowledge, pesticides have never been tested for these effects. We assessed the ability of pesticides that are commonly used in the European Union to suppress prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) synthesis. Changes in PGD2 secretion in juvenile mouse Sertoli cells (SC5 cells) were measured using an ELISA. Coincubation with arachidonic acid (AA) was conducted to determine the site of action in the PGD2 synthetic pathway. Molecular modeling studies were performed to assess whether pesticides identified as PGD2-active could serve as ligands of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) binding pocket. The pesticides boscalid, chlorpropham, cypermethrin, cyprodinil, fenhexamid, fludioxonil, imazalil (enilconazole), imidacloprid, iprodione, linuron, methiocarb, o-phenylphenol, pirimiphos-methyl, pyrimethanil, and tebuconazole suppressed PGD2 production. Strikingly, some of these substances-o-phenylphenol, cypermethrin, cyprodinil, linuron, and imazalil (enilconazole)-showed potencies (IC50) in the range between 175 and 1,500 nM, similar to those of analgesics intended to block COX enzymes. Supplementation with AA failed to reverse this effect, suggesting that the sites of action of these pesticides are COX enzymes. The molecular modeling studies revealed that the COX-2 binding pocket can accommodate most of the pesticides shown to suppress PGD2 synthesis. Some of these pesticides are also capable of antagonizing the androgen receptor. Chemicals with structural features more varied than previously thought can suppress PGD2 synthesis.

Hexavalent chromium (CrVI), one of the more toxic heavy metals, is widely used in more than 50 industries. As one of the world's leading producers of Cr compounds, the U.S. is facing growing challenges in protecting human health against adverse effects of CrVI. Our recent findings demonstrated that in vivo CrVI exposure during gestational period caused POF in F1 offspring. Our current research focus is three-fold: (i) to identify the effect of CrVI on critical windows of great vulnerability of fetal ovarian development; (ii) to understand the molecular mechanism of CrVI-induced POF; (iii) to identify potential intervention strategies to mitigate or inhibit CrVI effects. In order to accomplish these goals we used a fetal whole ovarian culture system. Fetuses were removed from the normal pregnant rats on gestational day 13.5. Fetal ovaries were cultured in vitro for 12 days, and treated with or without 0.1 ppm potassium dichromate (CrVI) from culture day 2-8, which recapitulated embryonic day 14.5-20.5, in vivo. Results showed that CrVI increased germ cell/oocyte apoptosis by increasing caspase 3, BAX, p53 and PUMA; decreasing BCL2, BMP15, GDF9 and cKIT; and altering cell cycle regulatory genes and proteins. This model system may serve as a potential tool for high throughput testing of various drugs and/or EDCs in particular to assess developmental toxicity of the ovary.",PMC4628871

Although males are exposed to combinations of chemicals, few studies have evaluated the effects of ED mixtures at environmentally relevant doses. Our previous work showed that fetal exposure to a mixture of the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) and the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) induced unique alterations in adult testis. In this follow-up study, we examined Postnatal Day 3 (PND3) and PND6 male offspring exposed from Gestational Day 14 to parturition to corn oil, 10mg/kg GEN, DEHP, or their combination, to gain insight into the early molecular events driving long-term alterations. DEHP stimulated the mRNA and protein expression of the steroidogenic enzyme HSD3B, uniquely at PND3. DEHP also increased the mRNA expression of Nestin, a Leydig progenitor/Sertoli cell marker, and markers of Sertoli cell (Wt1), gonocyte (Plzf, Foxo1), and proliferation (Pcna) at PND3, while these genes were unchanged by the mixture. Redox (Nqo1, Sod2, Sod3, Trx, Gst, Cat) and xenobiotic transporter (Abcb1b, Abcg2) gene expression was also increased by DEHP at PND3, while attenuated when combined with GEN, suggesting the involvement of cellular stress in short-term DEHP effects and a protective effect of GEN. The direct effects of GEN and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, the principal bioactive metabolite of DEHP, on testis were investigated in PND3 organ cultures, showing a stimulatory effect of 10 μM mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate on basal testosterone production that was normalized by GEN. These effects contrasted with previous reports of androgen suppression and decreased gene expression in perinatal rat testis by high DEHP doses, implying that neonatal effects are not predictive of adult effects. We propose that GEN, through an antioxidant action, normalizes reactive oxygen species-induced neonatal effects of DEHP. The notion that these EDs do not follow classical dose-response effects and involve different mechanisms of toxicity from perinatal ages to adulthood highlights the importance of assessing impacts across a range of doses and ages.",PMC4711908

EEs are known to cause the abnormalities of testes development and testicular descent. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a nonsteroidal synthetic estrogen that disrupts the morphology and proliferation of gubernacular cells, and its nongenomic effects on gubernaculum testis cells may be mediated by G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). In this study, we detected the expression of GPER in mouse gubernacular testis and investigated the effects of DES on the expression of GPER in gubernaculum testis cells. RT-PCR analysis revealed that GPER mRNA was expressed in the gubernaculum. GPER protein was detected in the parenchymal cells of the gubernaculum early in development. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GPER inhibitor G15 relieved DES-induced inhibition of GPER expression in gubernaculum testis cell, but ER inhibitor ICI 182780 had the converse effects on DES-induced inhibition of GPER expression in these cells.

We also analyzed TBBPA for its action on placental secretion of progesterone and β-hCG, cell viability, and apoptosis. Our results showed that after TBBPA treatment at 10 nM and 10 µM, PPARγ protein expression increased in a time-dependent manner until 48 h and then slightly decreased at 72 h but was still above the control level. This alteration in PPARγ protein expression was accompanied by a decreased β-hCG level. Interestingly, co-treatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 reversed the TBBPA-mediated changes in PPARγ protein expression but, according to β-hCG secretion, potentiated an inhibitory effect of TBBPA. Additionally, in our study, we assessed the ability of TBBPA to increase progesterone levels in JEG-3 cells compared with those of controls. Finally, in the present study, we demonstrated that TBBPA at all of the tested doses significantly increased caspase-3 activity compared with that of the vehicle control. The apoptotic action of TBBPA was also confirmed by Hoechst 33342 staining. These results showed the up-regulation of PPARγ protein expression after TBBPA exposure in human placental cells. Although co-treatment with antagonist of PPARγ reversed the TBBPA-mediated increase in this protein expression and restored it to the control level, it did not reverse the effect on β-hCG secretion. This indicated that the mechanism of TBBPA-induced changes in β-hCG secretion is PPARγ-independent.",PMC4589557

Here we investigated the impact of prenatal exposure to DEHP on spermatogenesis and DNA sperm methylation in two distinct, selected, and sequenced mice strains. FVB/N and C57BL/6J mice were orally exposed to 300 mg/kg/day of DEHP from gestation day 9 to 19. Prenatal DEHP exposure significantly decreased spermatogenesis in C57BL/6J (fold-change = 0.6, p-value = 8.7*10-4), but not in FVB/N (fold-change = 1, p-value = 0.9). The number of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by DEHP-exposure across the entire genome showed increased hyper- and decreased hypo-methylation in C57BL/6J compared to FVB/N. At the promoter level, three important subsets of genes were massively affected. Promoters of vomeronasal and olfactory receptors coding genes globally followed the same trend, more pronounced in the C57BL/6J strain, of being hyper-methylated in DEHP related conditions. In contrast, a large set of micro-RNAs were hypo-methylated, with a trend more pronounced in the FVB/N strain. We additionally analyze both the presence of functional genetic variations within genes that were associated with the detected DMRs and that could be involved in spermatogenesis, and DMRs related with the DEHP exposure that affected both strains in an opposite manner. The major finding in this study indicates that prenatal exposure to DEHP can decrease spermatogenesis in a strain-dependent manner and affects sperm DNA methylation in promoters of large sets of genes putatively involved in both sperm chemotaxis and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.",PMC4526524

Considerable evidence has also accumulated to indicate that aberrations in the stem and progenitor cell populations can lead to increased cancer risk in specific organs systems. It is long recognized that environmental factors play a major role in cancer etiology, and emerging data suggest that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may contribute to an increased cancer risk. Using the prostate gland as a model system, the present review highlights recent data that find that estrogens and EDCs can reprogram prostate stem and progenitor cell populations, leading to increased cancer susceptibility.

We have previously found associations between prenatal POP exposures and increased BMI, waist circumference and change in BMI from 5 to 7 years of age, though only among girls with overweight mothers. In the same birth cohort, we investigated whether prenatal POP exposure was associated with serum concentrations of insulin and leptin among 5-year-old children, thus possibly mediating the association with overweight and obesity at 7 years of age. The analyses were based on a prospective Faroese Birth Cohort (n=656), recruited between 1997 and 2000.

Insulin and leptin concentrations were transformed from continuous to binary variables, using the 75th percentile as a cut-off point. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate associations between prenatal POP exposures and non-fasting serum concentrations of insulin and leptin at age 5 while taking into account confounders.

To address this, the present studies were conducted as part of the CLARITY-BPA (Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity) program. The impact of perinatal BPA exposure (2.5, 25, or 2500 µg/kg body weight (bw)/day) on behaviors related to anxiety and exploratory activity was assessed in juvenile (prepubertal) and adult NCTR Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes.

In response to pH changes, however, these estrogen-dendrimer conjugates (EDCs) display a major morphological transition that alters the accessibility of the estrogen ligands that compromises the bioactivity of the EDC. A sharp break in dynamic behavior near pH 7 occurs for three different ligands on the surface of a PAMAM-G6 dendrimer: a fluorophore (tetramethylrhodamine [TMR]) and two estrogens (17α-ethynylestradiol and diphenolic acid). Collisional quenching and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy experiments with TMR-PAMAM revealed high ligand shielding above pH 7 and low shielding below pH 7. Furthermore, when the pH was cycled from 8.5 (conditions of ligand-PAMAM conjugation) to 4.5 (e.g., endosome/lysosome) and through 6.5 (e.g., hypoxic environment) back to pH 8.5, the 17α-ethynylestradiol- and diphenolic acid-PAMAM conjugates experienced a dramatic, irreversible loss in cell stimulatory activity; dynamic NMR studies indicated that the hormonal ligands had become occluded within the more hydrophobic core of the PAMAM dendrimer.

Unfortunately, these cells appear to contain only 1 of the 2 known ER isoforms, ERα but not ERβ, and the differential ligand selectivity of these ERs indicates that the currently accepted screening method only detects a subset of total estrogenic chemicals. To improve the estrogen screening bioassay, BG1Luc4E2 cells were stably transfected with an ERβ expression plasmid and positive clones identified using ERβ-selective ligands (genistein and Br-ERβ-041). A highly responsive clone (BG1LucERβc9) was identified that exhibited greater sensitivity and responsiveness to ERβ-selective ligands than BG1Luc4E2 cells, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of ERβ expression in these cells. Screening of pesticides and industrial chemicals identified chemicals that preferentially stimulated ERβ-dependent reporter gene expression. Together, these results not only demonstrate the utility of this dual-ER recombinant cell line for detecting a broader range of estrogenic chemicals than the current BG1Luc4E2 cell line, but screening with both cell lines allows identification of ERα- and ERβ-selective chemicals.",PMC4772679

To model heterogeneity in the growth patterns, we used a finite mixture model in combination with a data transformation to characterize body mass index (BMI) with four groups and estimated the association between exposure and group membership. In boys, higher maternal concentrations of DDT and DDE during pregnancy are associated with a BMI growth pattern that is stable until about age five followed by increased growth through age nine. In contrast, higher maternal DDT exposure during pregnancy is associated with a flat, relatively stable growth pattern in girls.

Morphological, stereological and chemical analyses revealed that long-term BPA exposure, even in environmental dosages, increases the proliferative status of the prostate, increases the number of ERα-positive stromal cells and elicits the development of prostatic hyperplasia in adult female gerbils. Moreover, we also observed that the association with testosterone did not increase the proliferative status of the gland, which shows that low levels of BPA are enough to cause an oestrogenic disruption of the prostate in young adults.

Both a positive control (estradiol benzoate; EB, 50μg/kg) and negative control (dimethylsulfoxide; DMSO in sesame oil vehicle) were similarly administered to separate sets of dams. The sexes responded differently in two tasks essential to sociality. Using a three-chamber apparatus that contained a caged, same-sex, gonadectomized stimulus animal and an empty stimulus cage, we found that both sexes showed a strong preference for affiliating with a stimulus animal (vs. an empty cage), an effect that was much more pronounced in the males. In the second task, a novel and a familiar stimulus animal were caged at opposite ends of the same apparatus. Females displayed a higher degree of novelty preference than the males. During both tests, females had significantly higher social approach behaviors while male engaged in significantly more interactive behaviors with the conspecific. Of particular interest, males born of dams that received prenatal A1221 (0.5mg/kg) exhibited an overall decrease in nose-to-nose investigations. These behavioral data suggest that the males are more sensitive to A1221 treatment than are females. In addition to behavioral analysis, serum corticosterone was measured. Females born of dams treated with A1221 (0.5mg/kg) had significantly higher concentrations of corticosterone than the DMSO female group; males were unaffected. Females also had significantly higher corticosterone concentrations than did males.

Functional analysis revealed upregulation of processes associated with vitellogenesis, including lipid metabolism, cellular proliferation, and ribosome biogenesis, together with a downregulation of carbohydrate metabolism. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we validated the expression of eight target genes and identified significant differences in the regulation of several known estrogen-responsive transcripts in fish exposed to the lower treatment concentrations (including esr1 and zp2.5).

Previous studies indicate that in utero BPA exposure increases the percentage of germ cells in nests and decreases the percentage of primordial follicles. However, the mechanism by which BPA affects germ cell nest breakdown is unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that BPA inhibits germ cell nest breakdown by interfering with oxidative stress and apoptosis pathways. To test our hypothesis, ovaries from newborn mice were collected and cultured with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) or different doses of BPA (0.1, 1, 5, and 10μg/mL). Ovaries then were subjected to histological evaluation of germ cell nests and primordial follicles or to measurements of factors that regulate oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our results indicate that in vitro BPA exposure significantly inhibits germ cell nest breakdown by altering the expression of key ovarian apoptotic genes, but not by interfering with the oxidative stress pathway.",PMC4550517

From pregnancy 7 d to 19 d, experimental group was sustained to gavage DEHP 750 mg/kg bw/day, observed the incidence of cryptorchidism in offspring and examined the pregnancy rate of female rats through mating experiments. Continuous recording the rat's weight and AGD value, after maturation (PND80) recording testis and epididymis' size and weight, detected the sperm number and quality. Subsequently, we examined the evolution morphological changes of testicular tissue for 4 generation rats by HE staining and Western Blot. Completed the MeDIP-sequencing analysis of 6 samples (F1 generation, F4 generation and Control). DEHP successfully induced cryptorchidism occurrence in offspring during pregnancy. The incidence of cryptorchidism in F1 was 30%, in F2 was 12.5%, and there was no cryptorchidism coming up in F3 and F4. Mating experiment shows conception rate 50% in F1, F2 generation was 75%, the F3 and F4 generation were 100%. HE staining showed that the seminiferous epithelium of F1 generation was atrophy and with a few spermatogenic cell, F2 generation had improved, F3 and F4 generation were tend to be normal. The DNA methyltransferase expression was up-regulated with the increase of generations by Real Time-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western Blot. MeDIP-seq Data Analysis Results show many differentially methylated DNA sequences between F1 and F4. DEHP damage male reproductive function in rats, affect expression of DNA methyltransferase enzyme, which in turn leads to genomic imprinting methylation pattern changes and passed on to the next generation, so that the offspring of male reproductive system critical role in the development of imprinted genes imbalances, and eventually lead to producing offspring cryptorchidism.

To investigate the associations between prenatal exposure to major POPs and thyroid hormone levels among newborn infants, both cord serum or maternal serum concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were compared with five thyroid hormones in cord serum of newborn infants as well as TSH in bloodspot collected at 2 day after birth (n=104). Since cord serum thyroid hormones could be affected by those of mothers, thyroid hormone concentrations of the matching mothers at delivery were adjusted. In cord serum, BDE-47, -99, and Σchlordane (CHD) showed significant positive associations with cord or bloodspot TSH. At the same time, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) and hexachlorbenzene (HCB) showed negative associations with total T3 and total T4 in cord serum, respectively. Maternal exposure to β-hexachlorhexane (β-HCH), ΣCHD, ΣDDT, or p,p'-DDE were also associated with neonatal thyroid hormones. Although the sample size is small and the thyroid hormone levels of the subjects were within the reference range, our observation supports thyroid disrupting potential of several POPs among newborn infants, at the levels occurring in the general population.

In pregnant women enrolled in a Spanish birth cohort study between 2004 and 2006, we measured the concentrations of 10 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, cadmium, arsenic, and lead in two maternal pregnancy urine samples; 6 organochlorine compounds in maternal pregnancy serum; mercury in cord blood; and 6 polybrominated diphenyl ether congeners in colostrum. Among 470 children at 7 years, body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated, and overweight was defined as BMI > 85th percentile. We estimated associations with EDCs in single-pollutant models and applied principal-component analysis (PCA) on the 27 pollutant concentrations. In single-pollutant models, HCB (hexachlorobenzene), βHCH (β-hexachlorocyclohexane), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners 138 and 180 were associated with increased child BMI z-scores; and HCB, βHCH, PCB-138, and DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) with overweight risk.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression are still unknown. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3, or 30μg/L atrazine throughout embryogenesis. Larvae were then allowed to mature under normal laboratory conditions with no further chemical treatment until 7 days post fertilization (dpf) or adulthood and neurotransmitter analysis completed. No significant alterations in neurotransmitter levels was observed at 7dpf or in adult males, but a significant decrease in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and serotonin turnover was seen in adult female brain tissue. Transcriptomic analysis was completed on adult female brain tissue to identify molecular pathways underlying the observed neurological alterations. Altered expression of 1928, 89, and 435 genes in the females exposed to 0.3, 3, or 30μg/L atrazine during embryogenesis were identified, respectively. There was a high level of overlap between the biological processes and molecular pathways in which the altered genes were associated.

While these steroids can influence development, embryonic enzymes are thought to buffer some steroid sensitive processes, such as gonadal differentiation, from the effects of maternal steroids. Many of these same enzymes may also buffer the embryo from chemicals present in the environment, but this may alter their capacity to metabolize maternal steroids. Here, we characterized the ability of red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta) embryos to metabolize oestrone immediately following oviposition and tested whether a prevalent environmental chemical, Bisphenol A (BPA), would affect the in ovo conversion of oestrone to oestrone sulfate. We found that tritiated oestrone applied at the time of oviposition is mostly converted to oestrone sulfate within 6 h. However, when BPA is present, that conversion is inhibited, resulting in elevated oestrone levels. Our finding of rapid in ovo metabolism of steroids suggests that maternally derived enzymes are present in the egg and can alter embryonic exposure to exogenous chemicals. The disruption of this metabolism by BPA demonstrates how environmental chemicals might change embryonic exposure to endogenous substances within the egg.

Additional analysis of genomic imprints shows no persistent aberrations in DNA methylation at the differentially methylated regions of imprinted genes between the G1 and G2 prospermatogonia, or in the allele-specific transcription of imprinted genes between the G2 and G3 soma. Our results suggest that endocrine-disrupting chemicals exert direct epigenetic effects in exposed fetal germ cells, which are corrected by reprogramming events in the next generation.

The FR was slightly elevated among women with high levels of DEHP (FR=1.14, 95% CI 1.00;1.30) suggesting a shorter TTP in these women. The FR was unrelated to DiNP in women, whereas the results for men were inconsistent pointing in opposite directions. First-time pregnant women from Greenland with high serum DiNP levels had a longer TTP.

Our results showed that high concentrations of BPA inhibited sperm motility and motion kinematics by significantly decreasing ATP levels in spermatozoa. High BPA concentrations also increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on sperm proteins involved in protein kinase A-dependent regulation and induced a precocious acrosome reaction, which resulted in poor fertilization and compromised embryonic development. In addition, BPA induced the down-regulation of β-actin and up-regulated peroxiredoxin-5, glutathione peroxidase 4, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase. Our results suggest that high concentrations of BPA alter sperm function, fertilization, and embryonic development via regulation and/or phosphorylation of fertility-related proteins in spermatozoa.

The results revealed that long-term PNP exposure caused testicular histopathological changes such as vacuolation of spermatogenic cell and spermatocyte with significant testicular and cloacal gland atrophy. PNP activated CASP3 enzyme that is an apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase. Besides, it disrupted the expression of CLDN1. Furthermore, a substantial decrease in plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone was observed after 2 and 2.5 months in the PNP-treated groups. Meanwhile, the pituitary LH did not significantly change. Site of action of PNP may be peripheral on testicular development and/or centrally on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis through reduction of pulsatile secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone. Consequently, it may reduce the sensitivity of the anterior pituitary gland to secrete LH. In conclusion, PNP induced profound endocrine disruption in the form of hormonal imbalance, induction of CASP3, and disruption of CLDN1 expression in the testis. Hence, it may hinder the reproductive processes.",PMC4490174

The Faroe Islands community exhibits an unusually wide range of exposures to dietary contaminants, and in this setting we examined the possible association between PCB exposure and semen quality and reproductive hormones in fertile Faroese men. Participants in this cross-sectional study include 266 proven fertile men residing in the Faroe Islands. PCB levels and hormone profiles were measured in serum samples taken at the clinical examination that included semen quality parameters. A significant positive association was seen between serum-PCB and the testosterone/estradiol ratio (p=0.04). In the unadjusted analyses, elevated PCB exposure was associated with increased serum concentrations of SHBG (p=0.01) and FSH (p=0.05). We found no association between the serum PCB concentration and the semen quality variables. In this population of highly exposed fertile men, the current serum-PCB concentration was associated with higher androgen/estrogen ratio.

This study explored the association between breast cancer risk and residential exposures to ambient estrogen disruptors among participants in a large cohort study, the California Teachers Study. Participants consisted of 112,379 women free of breast cancer and living at a California address in 1995/1996. Eleven hazardous air pollutants from the US Environmental Protection Agency 2002 list were identified as estrogen disruptors based on published endocrine disrupting chemical lists and literature review. Census-tract estrogen disruptor air concentrations modeled by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2002 were assigned to participants' baseline addresses. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios associated with exposure to each estrogen disruptor and a summary measure of nine estrogenic hazardous air pollutants among all participants and selected subgroups, adjusting for age, race/birthplace, socioeconomic status, and known breast cancer risk factors. Five thousand three hundred sixty-one invasive breast cancer cases were identified between 1995 and 2010. No associations were found between residential exposure to ambient estrogen disruptors and overall breast cancer risk or hormone receptor-positive breast cancer risk, nor among targeted subgroups of participants (pre-/peri-menopausal women, post-menopausal women, never-smokers, non-movers, and never-smoking non-movers). However, elevated risks for hormone receptor-negative tumors were observed for higher exposure to cadmium compounds and possibly inorganic arsenic among never-smoking non-movers.

Recent research indicates that arsenic may be an endocrine disruptor. This study was conducted to evaluate the nature of gene expression changes among males and females exposed to arsenic contaminated water in Bangladesh at high and low doses. Twenty-nine (55% male) Bangladeshi adults with water arsenic exposure ranging from 50 to 1000 μg/L were selected from the Folic Acid Creatinine Trial. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix 1.0 ST arrays. Differentially expressed genes were assessed between high and low exposure groups for males and females separately and findings were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. There were 534 and 645 differentially expressed genes (p<0.05) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of males and females, respectively, when high and low water arsenic exposure groups were compared. Only 43 genes overlapped between the two sexes, with 29 changing in opposite directions. Despite the difference in gene sets both males and females exhibited common biological changes including deregulation of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes, deregulation of genes downstream of Sp1 (specificity protein 1) transcription factor, and prediction of estrogen receptor alpha as a key hub in cardiovascular networks. Arsenic-exposed adults exhibit sex-specific gene expression profiles that implicate involvement of the endocrine system.

Exposure-response relationships and reference levels were evaluated, and biomarker data were organized from carefully identified studies from the peer-reviewed literature to represent European exposure and approximate burden of disease as it occurred in 2010. The cost-of-illness estimation utilized multiple peer-reviewed sources. The expert panel identified low epidemiological and strong toxicological evidence for male infertility attributable to phthalate exposure, with a 40-69% probability of causing 618,000 additional assisted reproductive technology procedures, costing €4.71 billion annually. Low epidemiological and strong toxicological evidence was also identified for cryptorchidism due to prenatal polybrominated diphenyl ether exposure, resulting in a 40-69% probability that 4615 cases result, at a cost of €130 million (sensitivity analysis, €117-130 million). A much more modest (0-19%) probability of causation in testicular cancer by polybrominated diphenyl ethers was identified due to very low epidemiological and weak toxicological evidence, with 6830 potential cases annually and costs of €848 million annually (sensitivity analysis, €313-848 million). The panel assigned 40-69% probability of lower T concentrations in 55- to 64-year-old men due to phthalate exposure, with 24 800 associated deaths annually and lost economic productivity of €7.96 billion. EDCs may contribute substantially to male reproductive disorders and diseases, with nearly €15 billion annual associated costs in the EU.

Endangered species may be particularly at risk because inbreeding depression and stochastic fluctuations in male and female numbers are often observed in the small populations that typify these taxa. Here, we assessed the interactive effects of water temperature and EDC exposure on sexual development and population viability of inbred and outbred zebrafish (Danio rerio). Water temperatures adopted were 28 °C (current ambient mean spawning temperature) and 33 °C (projected for the year 2100). The EDC selected was clotrimazole (at 2 μg/L and 10 μg/L), a widely used antifungal chemical that inhibits a key steroidogenic enzyme [cytochrome P450(CYP19) aromatase] required for estrogen synthesis in vertebrates. Elevated water temperature and clotrimazole exposure independently induced male-skewed sex ratios, and the effects of clotrimazole were greater at the higher temperature. Male sex ratio skews also occurred for the lower clotrimazole exposure concentration at the higher water temperature in inbred fish but not in outbred fish. Population viability analysis showed that population growth rates declined sharply in response to male skews and declines for inbred populations occurred at lower male skews than for outbred populations. These results indicate that elevated temperature associated with climate change can amplify the effects of EDCs and these effects are likely to be most acute in small, inbred populations exhibiting environmental sex determination and/or differentiation.",PMC4371911

Here, we have examined the expression of HOXC6 in breast cancer tissue, investigated its transcriptional regulation via estradiol (E2) and bisphenol-A (BPA, an estrogenic endocrine disruptor) in vitro and in vivo. We observed that HOXC6 is differentially over-expressed in breast cancer tissue. E2 induces HOXC6 expression in cultured breast cancer cells and in mammary glands of Sprague Dawley rats. HOXC6 expression is also induced upon exposure to BPA both in vitro and in vivo. Estrogen-receptor-alpha (ERα) and ER-coregulators such as MLL-histone methylases are bound to the HOXC6 promoter upon exposure to E2 or BPA and that resulted in increased histone H3K4-trimethylation, histone acetylation, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II at the HOXC6 promoter. HOXC6 overexpression induces expression of tumor growth factors and facilitates growth 3D-colony formation, indicating its potential roles in tumor growth.

BPA concentrations of 10(-8)M and 10(-5)M for 72 h reduced testosterone production by the Sprague-Dawley fetal rat testes, while only 10-5M suppressed it in the Wistar strain. The suppressive effects at 10-5M were seen as early as 24h and 48 h in both strains. BPA at 10(-7)-10(-5)M for 72 h suppressed the levels of fetal rat Leydig cell insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3).

Antral follicles are the functional ovarian units and must undergo growth, survival from atresia, and proper regulation of steroidogenesis to ovulate and produce hormones. Previous studies have determined that DEHP inhibits antral follicle growth and decreases estradiol levels in vitro; however, the mechanism by which DEHP elicits these effects is unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that DEHP directly alters regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis to inhibit antral follicle functionality. Antral follicles from adult CD-1 mice were cultured with vehicle control or DEHP (1-100 μg/ml) for 24-96 h to establish the temporal effects of DEHP on the follicle. Following 24-96 h of culture, antral follicles were subjected to gene expression analysis, and media were subjected to measurements of hormone levels. DEHP increased the mRNA levels of cyclin D2, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin E1, cyclin A2, and cyclin B1 and decreased the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A prior to growth inhibition. Additionally, DEHP increased the mRNA levels of BCL2-associated agonist of cell death, BCL2-associated X protein, BCL2-related ovarian killer protein, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, and Bcl2-like 10, leading to an increase in atresia. Further, DEHP decreased the levels of progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone prior to the decrease in estradiol levels, with decreased mRNA levels of side-chain cleavage, 17α-hydroxylase-17,20-desmolase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and aromatase.

In recent years, epigenetic drugs altering the epigenome of tumours actively have been developed for anti-cancer therapies. However, such drugs could potentially also affect other physiological pathways and systems in which intact epigenetic patterns are essential. Amongst those, male fertility is one of the most prominent. Consequently, we addressed possible direct effects of two epigenetic drugs, decitabine and vorinostat, on both, the male germ line and fertility. In addition, we checked for putative transgenerational epigenetic effects on the germ line of subsequent generations (F1-F3). Parental adult male C57Bl/6 mice were treated with either decitabine or vorinostat and analysed as well as three subsequent untreated generations derived from these males. Treatment directly affected several reproductive parameters as testis (decitabine & vorinostat) and epididymis weight, size of accessory sex glands (vorinostat), the height of the seminiferous epithelium and sperm concentration and morphology (decitabine). Furthermore, after decitabine administration, DNA methylation of a number of loci was altered in sperm. However, when analysing fertility of treated mice (fertilisation, litter size and sex ratio), no major effect of the selected epigenetic drugs on male fertility was detected. In subsequent generations (F1-F3 generations) only subtle changes on reproductive organs, sperm parameters and DNA methylation but no overall effect on fertility was observed. Consequently, in mice, decitabine and vorinostat neither affected male fertility per se nor caused marked transgenerational effects. We therefore suggest that both drugs do not induce major adverse effects-in terms of male fertility and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance-when used in anti-cancer-therapies.",PMC4334483

We first generated a reference map for cardiovascular single cells through quantifying lineage-defining genes for CPCs, CMs, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), endothelial cells (EDCs), fibroblasts and mESCs. This panel was then applied against single embryonic day 10.5 heart cells to demonstrate its ability to identify each endocardial cell and chamber-specific CM. In addition, we compared the gene expression profile of embryo- and mESC-derived CPCs and CMs at different developmental stages and showed that mESC-derived CMs are phenotypically similar to embryo-derived CMs up to the neonatal stage. Furthermore, we showed that single-cell expression assays coupled with time-lapse microscopy can resolve the identity and the lineage relationships between progenies of single cultured CPCs. With this approach, we found that mESC-derived Nkx2-5(+) CPCs preferentially become SMCs or CMs, whereas single embryo-derived Nkx2-5(+) CPCs represent two phenotypically distinct subpopulations that can become either EDCs or CMs. These results demonstrate that multiplex gene expression analysis in single cells is a powerful tool for examining the unique behaviors of individual embryo- or mESC-derived cardiac cells.",PMC4352984

Multi linear regression models considered complex survey design characteristics and adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, body mass index. EDCs were stratified into long (>1 year), short, and unknown half-lives; principle analyses were performed on those with long half-lives as well as phthalates, known reproductive toxicants. Secondary analysis determined whether the odds of being menopausal increased with EDC exposure among women aged 45-55 years.

Although numerous studies have reported that estrogenic exposures negatively impact spermatogenesis, a direct link between exposures and meiotic errors in males has not been evaluated. To test the effect of estrogenic chemicals on meiotic chromosome dynamics, we exposed male mice to either BPA or to the strong synthetic estrogen, ethinyl estradiol during neonatal development when the first cells initiate meiosis. Although chromosome pairing and synapsis were unperturbed, exposed outbred CD-1 and inbred C3H/HeJ males had significantly reduced levels of crossovers, or meiotic recombination (as defined by the number of MLH1 foci in pachytene cells) by comparison with placebo. Unexpectedly, the effect was not limited to cells exposed at the time of meiotic entry but was evident in all subsequent waves of meiosis. To determine if the meiotic effects induced by estrogen result from changes to the soma or germline of the testis, we transplanted spermatogonial stem cells from exposed males into the testes of unexposed males. Reduced recombination was evident in meiocytes derived from colonies of transplanted cells. Taken together, our results suggest that brief exogenous estrogenic exposure causes subtle changes to the stem cell pool that result in permanent alterations in spermatogenesis (i.e., reduced recombination in descendent meiocytes) in the adult male.",PMC4304829

Results showed that gestational exposure to CrVI: 1) increased germ cell/oocyte apoptosis and advanced germ cell nest (GCN) breakdown; 2) increased X-prolyl aminopeptidase (Xpnpep) 2, a POF marker in humans, during GCN breakdown; 3) decreased Xpnpep2 during postnatal follicle development; and 4) increased colocalization of Xpnpep2 with Col3 and Col4. We also found that Xpnpep2 inversely regulated the expression of Col1, Col3, and Col4 in all the developmental stages studied. Thus, CrVI advanced GCN breakdown and increased follicle atresia in F1 female progeny by targeting Xpnpep2.",PMC4358023

We examined the effects of perinatal exposure to BDE-47, the most biologically active and prevalent BDE congener in North America, on epigenetic patterns in the frontal lobe of Wistar rats. Dams were gavaged with BDE-47 (0.002 and 0.2mg/kg body weight) at gestation days 9 and 16, and postnatal days 1, 8, and 15. Frontal lobes from offspring at postnatal day 41 were collected to measure 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase genes (Mt-co1, Mt-co2, and Mt-co3), global nuclear 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) content, 5mC in repetitive elements L1Rn, and 5mC in nuclear genes (Bdnf, Crhr1, Mc2r, Nr3c1, and Snca) related to behavioral and brain functions in the nuclear genome. We observed a significant decrease in %5mC in Mt-co2 (difference from control=-0.68%, p=0.01 at the 0.2mg/kg BDE-47). 5mC in repetitive elements L1Rn decreased at 0.002 mg/kg BDE-47 (difference=-1.23%, p=0.02).

We developed a system to construct a recombinant adenovirus containing the Ahr to re-express the Ahr in AhrKO granulosa cells and whole antral follicles. We then compared follicle growth and levels of factors in the AHR signaling pathway (Ahr, Ahrr, Cyp1a1, and Cyp1b1) in wild-type, AhrKO, and Ahr re-expressed follicles. Further, we compared the response to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in wild-type, AhrKO, and Ahr re-expressed follicles. Ahr injection into AhrKO follicles partially restored their growth pattern to wild-type levels. Further, Ahr re-expressed follicles had significantly higher levels of Ahr, Ahrr, Cyp1a1, and Cyp1b1 compared to wild-type follicles.

The objective of the current study was to assess the association between exposure markers of various EDCs and thyroxine (T4) levels in newborns in a mother-child cohort in the Netherlands. Exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), three di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was determined in cord plasma or breast milk, and information on T4 levels in heel prick blood spots was obtained through the neonatal screening programme in the Netherlands. Linear regression models were composed to determine associations between each of the compounds and T4, which were stratified for gender and adjusted for a priori defined covariates. Mean T4 level was 86.9 nmol/L (n = 83). Girls in the highest quartile of DDE and PFOA exposure showed an increased T4 level compared to the lowest quartile with both crude and fully adjusted models (DDE > 107.50 ng/L, +24.8 nmol/L, 95% CI 0.79, 48.75; PFOA > 1200 ng/L, +38.6 nmol/L, 95% CI 13.34, 63.83). In boys a lower T4 level was seen in the second quartile of exposure for both PFOS and PFOA, however after fully adjusting the models these associations were attenuated. No effects were observed for the other compounds. DDE and perfluorinated alkyl acids may be associated with T4 in a sex-specific manner.

Bulk imprinting was used to detect the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) known as estradiols. The estrogen 17β-estradiol is one of the most potent EDCs, even at very low concentrations. A highly sensitive, selective and robust QCM sensor was fabricated for real time monitoring of 17β-estradiol in water samples by using molecular imprinted polyurethane. Optimization of porogen (pyrene) and cross-linker (phloroglucinol) levels leads to improved sensitivity, selectivity and response time of the estradiol sensor. Surface imprinting of polyurethane as sensor coating also allowed us to generate interaction sites for the selective recognition of bacteria, even in a very complex mixture of interfering compounds, while they were growing from their spores in nutrient solution. A double molecular imprinting approach was followed to transfer the geometrical features of natural bacteria onto the synthetic polymer to generate biomimetic bacteria. The use of biomimetic bacteria as template makes it possible to prepare multiple sensor coatings with similar sensitivity and selectivity. Thus, cell typing, e.g., differentiation of bacteria strains, bacteria growth profile and extent of their nutrition, can be monitored by biomimetic mass sensors. Obviously, this leads to controlled cell growth in bioreactors.",PMC4299071

Traditional diagnostic applications of AF have focused almost exclusively on the diagnosis of genetic aberrations such as Trisomy-21 and on heritable diseases in high-risk pregnancies. Since more than 50 anthropogenic compounds have been detected in AF, there is considerable potential in utilizing fetal protein biomarkers as indicators of health effects related to prenatal toxic exposure. Here, we focus on preterm birth (PTB) to illustrate opportunities and limitations of using AF as a diagnostic matrix. Representing a pervasive public health challenge worldwide, PTB cannot be managed simply by improving hygiene and broadening access to healthcare. This is illustrated by 15-year increases of PTB in the U.S. from 1989 to 2004. AF is uniquely suited as a matrix for early detection of the association between fetal exposures and PTB due to its fetal origin and the fact that it is sampled from women who are at higher risk of PTB. This critical review shows the occurrence in AF of a number of xenobiotics, including endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), which are known or may reasonably be expected to shorten fetal gestation. It is not yet known whether EDCs, including bisphenol A, phytoestrogens, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), can affect the expression of proteins considered viable or potential biomarkers for the onset of PTB.

Many of such EDCs have been shown to adversely influence brain mesocorticolimbic systems raising the potential for cumulative toxicity. As such, understanding the effects of developmental exposure to mixtures of EDCs is critical to public health protection. Consequently, this study compared the effects of a mixture of four EDCs to their effects alone to examine potential for enhanced toxicity, using behavioral domains and paradigms known to be mediated by mesocorticolimbic circuits (fixed interval (FI) schedule controlled behavior, novel object recognition memory and locomotor activity) in offspring of pregnant mice that had been exposed to vehicle or relatively low doses of four EDCs, atrazine (ATR - 10mg/kg), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA - 0.1mg/kg), bisphenol-A (BPA - 50 μg/kg), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD - 0.25 μg/kg) alone or combined in a mixture (MIX), from gestational day 7 until weaning. EDC-treated males maintained significantly higher horizontal activity levels across three testing sessions, indicative of delayed habituation, whereas no effects were found in females. Statistically significant effects of MIX were seen in males, but not females, in the form of increased FI response rates, in contrast to reductions in response rate with ATR, BPA and TCDD, and reduced short term memory in the novel object recognition paradigm. MIX also reversed the typically lower neophobia levels of males compared to females. With respect to individual EDCs, TCDD produced notable increases in FI response rates in females, and PFOA significantly increased ambulatory locomotor activity in males. Collectively, these findings show the potential for enhanced behavioral effects of EDC mixtures in males and underscore the need for animal studies to fully investigate mixtures, including chemicals that converge on common physiological substrates to examine potential mechanisms of toxicity with full dose effect curves to assist in interpretations of relevant mechanisms.",PMC4387783

A test chamber was divided lengthwise so each arena held one fish unable to detect the presence of the other fish. A mirror was inserted at one end of each arena; baseline activity levels were determined without mirror. Arenas were divided into three computer-generated zones to represent different distances from mirror image. Circadian rhythm patterns were evaluated at 1-3 (= AM) and 5-8 (= PM) h postprandial. Adult zebrafish were placed into arenas and monitored by digital camera for 5 min. Total distance traveled, percent of time spent at mirror image, and number of attacks on mirror image were quantified.

Algal, microbial, zooplankton and benthic invertebrate communities showed no declines in abundance during three summers of EE2 additions (5-6 ng l(-1)), indicating no direct toxic effects. Recruitment of fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) failed, leading to a near-extirpation of this species both 2 years during (young-of-year, YOY) and 2 years following (adults and YOY) EE2 additions. Body condition of male lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and male and female white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) declined before changes in prey abundance, suggesting direct effects of EE2 on this endpoint. Evidence of indirect effects of EE2 was also observed. Increases in zooplankton, Chaoborus, and emerging insects were observed after 2 or 3 years of EE2 additions, strongly suggesting indirect effects mediated through the reduced abundance of several small-bodied fishes. Biomass of top predator lake trout declined by 23-42% during and after EE2 additions, most probably an indirect effect from the loss of its prey species, the fathead minnow and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus).

In view of cell therapy application in uterine pathologies, we studied AMCs in comparison to cells isolated from the endometrium of mares at diestrus (EDCs) being the endometrium during diestrus and early pregnancy similar from a hormonal standpoint. In particular, we demonstrated that amnion tissue fragments (AM) shares the same transcriptional profile with endometrial tissue fragments (ED), expressing genes involved in early pregnancy (AbdB-like Hoxa genes), pre-implantation conceptus development (Erα, PR, PGRMC1 and mPR) and their regulators (Wnt7a, Wnt4a). Soon after the isolation, only AMCs express Wnt4a and Wnt7a. Interestingly, the expression levels of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) were found greater in AM and AMCs than their endometrial counterparts thus confirming the role of AMCs as mediators of inflammation. The expression of nuclear progesterone receptor (PR), membrane-bound intracellular progesterone receptor component 1 (PGRMC1) and membrane-bound intracellular progesterone receptor (mPR), known to lead to improved endometrial receptivity, was maintained in AMCs over 5 passages in vitro when the media was supplemented with progesterone. To further explore the potential of AMCs in endometrial regeneration, their capacity to support resident cell proliferation was assessed by co-culturing them with EDCs in a transwell system or culturing in the presence of AMC-conditioned medium (AMC-CM). A significant increase in EDC proliferation rate exhibited the crucial role of soluble factors as mediators of stem cells action. The present investigation revealed that AMCs, as well as their derived conditioned media, have the potential to improve endometrial cell replenishment when low proliferation is associated to pregnancy failure.

25349983,"Hui Wen Ng, Wenqian Zhang, Mao Shu, Heng Luo, Weigong Ge, Roger Perkins, Weida Tong, Huixiao Hong",Competitive molecular docking approach for predicting estrogen receptor subtype α agonists and antagonists.,2014,"Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous compounds that interfere with the endocrine system of vertebrates, often through direct or indirect interactions with nuclear receptor proteins. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are particularly important protein targets and many EDCs are ER binders, capable of altering normal homeostatic transcription and signaling pathways. An estrogenic xenobiotic can bind ER as either an agonist or antagonist to increase or inhibit transcription, respectively. The receptor conformations in the complexes of ER bound with agonists and antagonists are different and dependent on interactions with co-regulator proteins that vary across tissue type. Assessment of chemical endocrine disruption potential depends not only on binding affinity to ERs, but also on changes that may alter the receptor conformation and its ability to subsequently bind DNA response elements and initiate transcription. Using both agonist and antagonist conformations of the ERα, we developed an in silico approach that can be used to differentiate agonist versus antagonist status of potential binders. The approach combined separate molecular docking models for ER agonist and antagonist conformations. The ability of this approach to differentiate agonists and antagonists was first evaluated using true agonists and antagonists extracted from the crystal structures available in the protein data bank (PDB), and then further validated using a larger set of ligands from the literature. The usefulness of the approach was demonstrated with enrichment analysis in data sets with a large number of decoy ligands. The performance of individual agonist and antagonist docking models was found comparable to similar models in the literature. When combined in a competitive docking approach, they provided the ability to discriminate agonists from antagonists with good accuracy, as well as the ability to efficiently select true agonists and antagonists from decoys during enrichment analysis. This approach enables evaluation of potential ER biological function changes caused by chemicals bound to the receptor which, in turn, allows the assessment of a chemical's endocrine disrupting potential. The approach can be used not only by regulatory authorities to perform risk assessments on potential EDCs but also by the industry in drug discovery projects to screen for potential agonists and antagonists.",PMC4251048

CYP1A1 mRNA was positively correlated with PL (r = 0.64; P < .0001) and GH-V (P < .0001, r = 0.62) mRNA. PL and GH-V mRNA were correlated with each other (r = 0.95; P < .0001), suggesting a common activator. The mRNAs not regulated by TH were not correlated with CYP1A1 expression. CYP1A1 mRNA expression is strongly associated with the expression of TH-regulated target gene mRNAs in human placenta, consistent with the endocrine-disrupting action of metabolites produced by CYP1A1.",PMC4255108

25243857,"Chinaza Egbuta, Jessica Lo, Debashis Ghosh",Mechanism of inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis by azole fungicides.,2014,"Biosynthesis of estrogens from androgens is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 aromatase. Aromatase inhibition by the triazole compounds letrozole (LTZ) and anastrozole is a prevalent therapy for estrogen-dependent postmenopausal breast cancer. Azoles are widely used as agricultural fungicides and antimycotic drugs that target 14α-demethylase. Some were previously shown to inhibit aromatase, thereby raising the possibility of endocrine disruptive effects. However, mechanistic analysis of their inhibition has never been undertaken. We have evaluated the inhibitory effects of 3 common fungicides, bifonazole, imazalil, and flusilazole, in human aromatase purified from placenta and compared them with LTZ, the most potent inhibitor of aromatase. Bifonazole exhibits strong inhibitory effects with an IC50 of 270nM and Ki (Michaeles-Menten inhibition constant) of 68nM, compared with 10nM and 13nM, respectively, for LTZ. The IC50 and Ki are 1100nM and 278nM for imazilil and 3200nM and 547nM for flusilazole, respectively. Analyses of inhibition kinetics suggest that the modes of inhibition by azole fungicides are mixed or competitive, whereas LTZ inhibition could be noncompetitive or mixed. We interpret the inhibition mechanism in the context of the x-ray structure of aromatase-androstenedione complex. Structural data show that aromatase has 3 binding pockets in relation to the heme. The substrate-binding cavity at the heme-distal site closely compliments the structures of the natural substrate, androstenedione, and steroidal aromatase inhibitors. Because the structures of LTZ and the azole fungicides are entirely dissimilar to the androstenedione backbone, the azoles possibly inhibit by binding to a structurally rearranged active site, the 2 other catalytically important sites, or both, in agreement with the kinetics data.",PMC4239419

Developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have been hypothesized to exacerbate risk, in part because PCOS hallmarks and associated metabolic co-morbidities can be reliably induced in animal models by perinatal androgen exposure. Here we show that lifetime exposure to a soy diet, containing endocrine active phytoestrogens, but not developmental exposure (gestational day 6-lactational day 40) to the endocrine disrupting monomer bisphenol A (BPA), can induce key features of PCOS in the rat; results which support the hypothesis that hormonally active diets may contribute to risk when consumed throughout gestation and post-natal life.",PMC4366357

Therefore, EU legislation for pesticides requires the evaluation of single active substances as well as the consideration of combination effects. Hence the analysis of combined effects of substances in a broad dose range represents a key challenge to current experimental and regulatory toxicology. Here we report evidence for additive effects for (tri)azole fungicides, a widely used group of antifungal agents, in the human placental cell line Jeg-3. In addition to the triazoles cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, flusilazole and tebuconazole and the azole fungicide prochloraz also pesticides from other chemical classes assumed to act via different modes of action (i.e., the organophosphate chlorpyrifos and the triazinylsulfonylurea herbicide triflusulfuron-methyl) were investigated. Endpoints analysed include synthesis of steroid hormone production (progesterone and estradiol) and gene expression of steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic cytochrome-P-450 (CYP) enzymes. For the triazoles and prochloraz, a dose dependent inhibition of progesterone production was observed and additive effects could be confirmed for several combinations of these substances in vitro. The non-triazoles chlorpyrifos and triflusulfuron-methyl did not affect this endpoint and, in line with this finding, no additivity was observed when these substances were applied in mixtures with prochloraz. While prochloraz slightly increased aromatase expression and estradiol production and triflusulfuron-methyl decreased estradiol production, none of the other substances had effects on the expression levels of steroidogenic CYP-enzymes in Jeg-3 cells. For some triazoles, prochloraz and chlorpyrifos a significant induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression and potential combination effects for this endpoint were observed.

The potential impacts that paper mill effluent exposure has on the G. holbrooki endocrine system and the stream ecosystem are unknown. The objective of this study was to use gene expression analysis to determine if exposure to an androgen receptor agonist was occurring and to couple this analysis with in vitro assays to evaluate the presence of androgen and progesterone receptor active chemicals in the Fenholloway River. Focused gene expression analyses of masculinized G. holbrooki from downstream of the Fenholloway River paper mill were indicative of androgen exposure, while genes related to reproduction indicated potential progesterone exposure. Hepatic microarray analysis revealed an increase in the expression of metabolic genes in Fenholloway River fish, with similarities in genes and biological processes compared to G. holbrooki exposed to androgens. Water samples collected downstream of the paper mill and at a reference site indicated that progesterone and androgen receptor active chemicals were present at both sites, which corroborates previous chemical analyses.

We measured phthalate metabolite and BPA concentrations in urine collected from mothers during their third trimester (n=116) and from their female children at ages 8-13 years (n=129). Among girls, we measured concurrent serum hormone concentrations, Tanner stages for breast and pubic hair development, and collected information on menarche onset. We used linear and logistic regression to model associations between in utero and peripubertal measures of exposure with hormones and sexual maturation, respectively, controlling for covariates. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in in utero urinary mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) was positively associated with 29% (95% CI: 9.2-52.6%) higher dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), an early indicator of adrenarche, and 5.3 (95% CI: 1.13-24.9) times higher odds of a Tanner stage >1 for pubic hair development. Similar relationships were observed with other in utero but not peripubertal di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites. IQR increases in in utero monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) and monoethyl phthalate (MEP) were associated with 29% and 25% higher serum testosterone concentrations (95% CI: 4.3-59.3; 2.1-54.1), respectively. In addition, we observed suggestive associations between in utero and peripubertal MEP concentrations and increased odds of having undergone menarche, and between peripubertal MnBP concentrations and increased odds of having a Tanner stage >1 for both breast and pubic hair development.

The objective of this study is to explore the association between maternal NP and hormonal levels, such as estradiol, testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and progesterone. A pregnant women cohort was established in North Taiwan between March and December 2010. Maternal urine and blood samples from the first, second, and third trimesters of gestation were collected.

Using a mouse model, we previously found that adult female mice exposed in utero to TCDD (F1 generation) as well as multiple subsequent generations (F2-F4) exhibited reduced fertility and an increased incidence of spontaneous preterm birth. Additional studies revealed that male F1 mice with a similar in utero/developmental TCDD exposure also exhibited diminished fertility and conferred an increased risk of preterm birth to their unexposed mating partners. Herein, we extend these previous observations, reporting that reduced fertility in male F1 mice is linked to testicular inflammation which coincides with apoptosis of developing spermatocytes, sub-fertility and an increased risk of preterm birth in their unexposed mating partners. Significantly, in the absence of additional toxicant exposure, testicular inflammation and reduced fertility persisted in F2 and F3 males and their control mating partners also frequently exhibited spontaneous preterm birth. Although a steady, global decline in male fertility has been noted over the last few decades, the reasons for these changes have not been firmly established. Likewise, the PTB rate in the U.S. and other countries has paralleled industrial development, suggesting a possible relationship between environmental toxicant exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Most current clinical strategies to prevent preterm birth are focused solely on the mother and have yielded limited benefits. In contrast, our studies strongly suggest that the preconception testicular health of the father is a critical determinant of pregnancy outcomes in mice. Future clinical studies should examine the potential contribution of the male to gestation length in women and whether efforts to reduce the incidence of preterm birth should be initiated in both parents prior to pregnancy.",PMC4134254

We found that 100 nM TBT reduced the amounts of α-ketoglutarate, succinate and malate. We further found that TBT decreased the activity of NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-IDH), which catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle. In addition, TBT inhibited cell growth and enhanced neuronal differentiation through NAD-IDH inhibition. Furthermore, studies using bacterially expressed human NAD-IDH and in silico simulations suggest that TBT inhibits NAD-IDH due to a possible interaction.

Postmating (D0.5-D4.5) DES exposure affected postovulation events leading to impaired embryo implantation. A 5-day premating rest from 5-week DES exposure (3-8 weeks old) resulted in recovery of early pregnancy rate.

Here we report the identification and analysis of the first piscine 5' regulatory region of the vtgr gene which was cloned from largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Using this putative promoter sequence, we investigated a role for hormones, including insulin and 17β-estradiol (E2), in transcriptional regulation through cell-based reporter assays. No effect of insulin was observed, however, E2 was able to repress transcriptional activity of the vtgr promoter through select estrogen receptor subtypes, Esr1 and Esr2a but not Esr2b. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that Esr1 likely interacts with the vtgr promoter region through half ERE and/or SP1 sites, in part. Finally we also show that ethinylestradiol (EE2), but not bisphenol-A (BPA), represses promoter activity similarly to E2. These results reveal for the first time that the Esr1 isoform may play an inhibitory role in the expression of LMB vtgr mRNA under the influence of E2, and potent estrogens such as EE2.

PBDEs may interfere with thyroid hormone (TH) during development, which could produce neurobehavioral deficits. An assumption in experimental and epidemiological studies is that PBDE effects on serum TH levels will reflect PBDE effects on TH action in tissues. To test whether this assumption is correct, we performed the following experiments. First, five concentrations of diphenyl ether (0-30 mg/kg) were fed daily to pregnant rats to postnatal day 21. PBDEs were measured in dam liver and heart to estimate internal dose. The results were compared with a separate study in which four concentrations of propylthiouracil (PTU; 0, 1, 2, and 3 ppm) was provided to pregnant rats in drinking water for the same duration as for diphenyl ether. PBDE exposure reduced serum T4 similar in magnitude to PTU, but serum TSH was not elevated by PBDE. PBDE treatment did not affect the expression of TH response genes in the liver or heart as did PTU treatment. PTU treatment reduced T4 in liver and heart, but PBDE treatment reduced T4 only in the heart. Tissue PBDEs were in the micrograms per gram lipid range, only slightly higher than observed in human fetal tissues. Thus, PBDE exposure reduces serum T4 but does not produce effects on tissues typical of low TH produced by PTU, demonstrating that the effects of chemical exposure on serum T4 levels may not always be a faithful proxy measure of chemical effects on the ability of thyroid hormone to regulate development and adult physiology.",PMC4164921

We examined the activation of hPXR by seven pesticide mixtures most likely found in the French diet and their individual components. The mixture's effect was estimated using the concentration addition (CA) model. PXR transactivation was measured by monitoring luciferase activity in hPXR/HepG2 cells and CYP3A4 expression in human hepatocytes. The three mixtures with the highest potency were evaluated using the CA model, at equimolar concentrations and at their relative proportion in the diet. The seven mixtures significantly activated hPXR and induced the expression of CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes. Of the 14 pesticides which constitute the three most active mixtures, four were found to be strong hPXR agonists, four medium, and six weak. Depending on the mixture and pesticide proportions, additive, greater than additive or less than additive effects between compounds were demonstrated. Predictions of the combined effects were obtained with both real-life and equimolar proportions at low concentrations. Pesticides act mostly additively to activate hPXR, when present in a mixture.

For MEOHP, boys in quartile 1 had a higher BMI than higher exposed boys (p = 0.029). High DDE exposure was associated with low BMI over time in boys (0.8 kg/m2 difference at 11 m). Boys with high MECPP exposure had a greater HC (1.0 cm difference at 11 m) than other boys (p = 0.047), as did girls in the second quartile of MEHHP (p = 0.018) and DDE (p < 0.001) exposure. In conclusion, exposure to phthalates and DDE was associated with BMI as well as with HC during the first year after birth. These results should be interpreted with caution though, due to the limited sample size.",PMC4113857

Stress and advanced parental age are determinants which frequently present positive findings. Multi-factorial influences on population sex ratio are rarely explored or tested in research. To test the hypothesis that dual factors of pollution and population stress affects sex proportion at birth through geographical analysis of Central Scotland. The study incorporates the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) tools to overlay modeled point source endocrine disruptor air emissions with ""small-area"" data on multiple deprivation (a proxy measurement of stress) and birth sex. Historical review of regional sex ratio trends presents additional data on sex ratio in Scotland to consider. There was no overall concentration in Central Scotland of low sex ratio neighborhoods with areas where endocrine disruptor air pollution and deprivation or economic stress were high. Historical regional trends in Scotland (from 1973), however, do show significantly lower sex ratio values for populations where industrial air pollution is highest (i.e. Eastern Central Scotland). Use of small area data sets and pollution inventories is a potential new method of inquiry for reproductive environmental and health protection monitoring and has produced interesting findings.",PMC4070448

We observed a weak, inverse association between early pregnancy use of a combination oral contraceptive and offspring overweight or obesity at age 3 (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.53, 1.08) and a positive, but imprecise, association with use of a progestin-only oral contraceptive in early pregnancy (adjusted OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.79, 2.02). In general, no association was observed between the use of a hormonal contraceptive before conception and offspring overweight or obesity. A sensitivity analysis comparing combination oral contraceptive users in early pregnancy to other unplanned pregnancies without hormonal contraceptive use further strengthened the inverse association (adjusted OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.02). Other sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the associations observed given varying assumptions. Pharmacologic sex hormones in early pregnancy may be inversely or positively associated with offspring overweight or obesity at age 3, depending on the specific formulation used.

In this work we explore whether prenatal exposure to mixtures of xenoestrogens has the potential to alter the placenta epigenome, by studying DNA methylation in retrotransposons as a surrogate of global DNA methylation. The biomarker total effective xenoestrogen burden (TEXB) was measured in 192 placentas from participants in the longitudinal INMA Project. DNA methylation was quantitatively assessed by bisulfite pyrosequencing on 10 different retrotransposons including 3 different long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), 4 short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and 3 human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). Associations were tested using linear mixed-effects regression models and sex interaction was evaluated. A significant sex interaction was observed for AluYb8 (p-value for interaction <0.001, significant at Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold of 0.0025). Boys with the highest TEXB-alpha levels of exposure (third tertile) presented on average a decrease of 0.84% in methylation compared to those in the first tertile (p-value<0.001), while no significant effects were found in girls (p-value=0.134).

The paternally expressed gene insulin-like growth-factor 2 (IGF2) is located about ~100kb from the maternally expressed non-coding gene H19 on human chromosome 11, and both genes play major roles in embryonic and placental growth. Given adverse gestational environments can influence DNA methylation patterns in extra-embryonic tissues, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) alters H19 and IGF2 methylation in placenta. Our study was restricted to a total of 196 women co-enrolled in the Predictors of Preeclampsia Study and the Harvard Epigenetic Birth Cohort. First trimester urine concentrations of 8 phenols and 11 phthalate metabolites were measured and used to characterize EDC exposure profiles. We assessed methylation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by pyrosequencing of H19, IGF2DMR0, and IGF2DMR2 and correlated values with phenol and phthalate metabolites. We also assessed overall expression and allele-specific expression of H19 and IGF2. We found several significant associations between DNA methylation and additive biomarker measurements. A significant decrease in H19 methylation was associated with high levels of the sum (Σ) of phthalate metabolites and metabolites of low molecular weight (LMW) phthalates. Σphthalate and LMW phthalate concentrations were inversely associated with IGF2DMR0 methylation values. Variation in methylation was not associated with changes in allele-specific expression. However increased deviation of allele-specific expression of H19 was associated with Σdi(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites and high molecular weight phthalates. Neither methylation nor expression of these imprinted regions had a significant impact on birth length or birth weight.

Pregnant mice were treated with a subcutaneous injection of 10 µg/kg/day of BPA or a vehicle from day 9 to 16 of pregnancy. One month old offspring were divided into four different groups: vehicle treated mice that ate a normal chow diet (Control group); BPA treated mice that also ate a normal chow diet (BPA); vehicle treated animals that had a high fat diet (HFD) and BPA treated animals that were fed HFD (HFD-BPA). The BPA group started to gain weight at 18 weeks old and caught up to the HFD group before week 28.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a xenoestrogen commonly used in consumer products and the plastic industry. There is evidence and an ongoing discussion that endocrine disruptors like BPA may affect human health and also exert alterations on in the immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate age-dependent effects of BPA on the asthma risk using a murine model to explain the controversial results reported till date. BALB/c mice were exposed to BPA via the drinking water for different time periods including pregnancy and breastfeeding. To induce an asthma phenotype, mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA), followed by an intrapulmonary allergen challenge. BPA exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding had no significant effect on asthma development in the offspring. In contrast, lifelong exposure from birth until the last antigen challenge clearly increased eosinophilic inflammation in the lung, airway hyperreactivity and antigen-specific serum IgE levels in OVA-sensitized adult mice compared to mice without BPA exposure. Surprisingly, BPA intake during the sensitization period significantly reduced the development of allergic asthma. This effect was reversed in the presence of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. Our results demonstrate that the impact of BPA on asthma risk is strongly age-dependent and ranges from asthma-promoting to asthma-reducing effects. This could explain the diversity of results from previous studies regarding the observed health impact of BPA.",PMC4065062

Two androgen reporter gene assays and the enhanced H295R steroidogenesis assay were added to that previous defined ITS. These assays had added value, as several estrogenic model compounds also elicited clear and potent antiandrogenic properties and in addition also showed effects on steroidogenesis that might potentiate their apparent estrogenic effects in vivo. Adding these assays, examining mechanisms of action for estrogenicity apart from ERα binding, gives a more complete and comprehensive assessment of the ability of test compounds to interfere with endocrine signaling.

In this study we hypothesized that prenatal BPA treatment will also disrupt ovarian follicular dynamics. Pregnant sheep were treated from days 30 to 90 of gestation with 3 different BPA doses (0.05, 0.5, or 5mg/kgBW/day). All female offspring were estrus synchronized and transrectal ultrasonography was performed daily for 22days to monitor ovarian follicular and corpora lutea dynamics. Blood samples were collected to assess preovulatory hormonal changes and luteal progesterone dynamics. Statistical analysis revealed that the time interval between the estradiol rise and the preovulatory LH surge was shortened in the BPA-treated females. None of the three BPA doses had an effect on corpora lutea, progestogenic cycles, and mean number or duration of ovulatory and non-ovulatory follicles. However, differences in follicular count trajectories were evident in all three follicular size classes (2-3mm, 4-5mm, and ≥6mm) of prenatal BPA-treated animals compared to controls. Number of follicular waves tended also to be more variable in the prenatal BPA-treated groups ranging from 2 to 5 follicular waves per cycle, while this was restricted to 3 to 4 waves in control females. These changes in ovarian follicular dynamics coupled with defects in time interval between estradiol rise and preovulatory LH release are likely to lead to subfertility in prenatal BPA-treated females.",PMC4134973

Chemical analyses were based on gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. For in vitro analyses of endocrine potentials in water, sediment, and waste water samples, we used the E-screen assay (human breast cancer cells MCF-7) and reporter gene assays (human cell line HeLa-9903 and MDA-kb2).

We exposed juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta f. fario) to water downstream of a wastewater outfall (Schussen River) or to water from a reference site (Argen River) to investigate the vitellogenin production. Furthermore, two feral fish species, chub (Leuciscus cephalus) and spirlin (Alburnoides bipunctatus), were caught in both rivers to determine their gonadal maturity and the gonadosomatic index. Chemical analyses provided only little information about endocrine active substances, whereas the in vitro assays revealed endocrine potentials in most of the samples. In addition to endocrine potentials, we also observed toxic potentials (E-screen/reproduction test) in waste water samples, which could interfere with and camouflage endocrine effects. The results of our in vivo tests were mostly in line with the results of the in vitro assays and revealed a consistent reproduction-disrupting (reproduction tests) and an occasional endocrine action (vitellogenin levels) in both investigated rivers, with more pronounced effects for the Schussen river (e.g. a lower gonadosomatic index).

Large doses of DEHP disrupt normal ovarian function; however, the effects of DEHP at environmentally relevant levels, the effects of DEHP on folliculogenesis, and the mechanisms by which DEHP disrupts ovarian function are unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that relatively low levels of DEHP disrupt estrous cyclicity as well as accelerate primordial follicle recruitment by dysregulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Adult CD-1 mice were orally dosed with DEHP (20 μg/kg/day-750 mg/kg/day) daily for 10 and 30 days. Following dosing, the effects on estrous cyclicity were examined, and follicle numbers were histologically quantified. Further, the ovarian mRNA and protein levels of PI3K signaling factors that are associated with early folliculogenesis were quantified. The data indicate that 10- and 30-day exposure to DEHP prolonged the duration of estrus and accelerated primordial follicle recruitment. Specifically, DEHP exposure decreased the percentage of primordial follicles and increased the percentage of primary follicles counted following 10-day exposure and increased the percentage of primary follicles counted following 30-day exposure. DEHP exposure, at doses that accelerate folliculogenesis, increased the levels of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, and protein kinase B and decreased the levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog, potentially driving PI3K signaling.

Reduced offspring survival occurred when offspring were exposed to TCC at concentrations of 0.2% w/w and 0.5% w/w during lactation, in which only 13% of offspring raised by 0.2% w/w TCC dams survived beyond weaning and no offspring raised by 0.5% w/w TCC dams survived to this period. In utero exposure status had no effect on survival, as all pups nursed by control dams survived regardless of their in utero exposure status. Microscopic evaluation of dam mammary tissue revealed involution to be a secondary outcome of TCC exposure rather than a primary effect of compound administration. The average concentration of TCC in the milk was almost 4 times that of the corresponding maternal serum levels. The results demonstrate that gestational TCC exposure does not affect the ability of dams to carry offspring to term but TCC exposure during lactation has adverse consequences on the survival of offspring although the mechanism of reduced survival is currently unknown.

Relative to female controls, EE2-treated females were heavier, exhibited delayed vaginal opening, aberrant estrous cyclicity, increased play behavior, decreased running wheel activity, and increased aggression toward the stimulus male during sexual behavior assessments. Relative to male controls, EE2-treated males were older at testes descent and preputial separation and had lower testosterone levels. These results suggest EE2-induced masculinization/defeminization of females and are consistent with increased volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area (SDN-POA) at weaning in female siblings of these subjects (He, Z., Paule, M. G. and Ferguson, S. A. (2012) Low oral doses of bisphenol A increase volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area in male, but not female, rats at postnatal day 21. Neurotoxicol.

Prolonged alimentary exposure to BPA, OP, and NP in fish and birds was indicated by liver/muscle concentration ratios generally >1. The most influential factors on BPA and alkylphenol concentrations in the tissues of fishes and gulls were mainly diet and habitat. The study confirmed possible bioaccumulation in the food web. High BPA and NP concentrations in guano (≤2,700 and ≤300 ng g(-1) dw, respectively) indicated the ability of birds to detoxify and signalled the reintroduction of these compounds to seawater.

Agonist responses using this robotic BG1Luc assay were consistently inhibited by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780, confirming that agonist responses were due to binding to ERs rather than to a non-specific agonist response. This robotic assay also detected EA in complex mixtures of substances such as extracts of personal care products, plastic resins or plastic consumer products.

However, limited information is available on the endocrine disrupting effects of phthalates in aquatic organisms. The aim of the present study was to examine whether exposure to mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the hydrolytic metabolite of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) disrupts thyroid endocrine system in fish. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to different concentrations of MEHP (1.6, 8, 40, and 200 μg/L) from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 168 hpf. The whole-body content of thyroid hormone and transcription of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were examined. Treatment with MEHP significantly decreased whole-body T4 contents and increased whole-body T3 contents, indicating thyroid endocrine disruption. The upregulation of genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism (Dio2 and UGT1ab) might be responsible for decreased T4 contents. Elevated gene transcription of Dio1 was also observed in this study, which might assist to degrade increased T3 contents. Exposure to MEHP also significantly induced transcription of genes involved in thyroid development (Nkx2.1 and Pax8) and thyroid hormone synthesis (TSHβ, NIS and TG). However, the genes encoding proteins involved in TH transport (transthyretin, TTR) was transcriptionally significantly down-regulated after exposure to MEHP. Overall, these results demonstrate that acute exposure to MEHP alters whole-body contents of thyroid hormones in zebrafish embryos/larvae and changes the transcription of genes involved in the HPT axis, thus exerting thyroid endocrine toxicity.",PMC3962405

Beside E2, a class of synthetic and plant-derived chemicals collectively named endocrine disruptors (EDs) or xenoestrogens bind to and modify both nuclear and extra-nuclear ERα activities. However, at the present no information is available on the ability of EDs to hamper ERα intracellular concentration. Here, the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and naringenin (Nar), prototypes of synthetic and plant-derived ERα ligands, have been evaluated on ERα levels in MCF-7 cells. Both EDs mimic E2 in triggering ERα Ser118 phosphorylation and gene transcription. However, only E2 or BPA induce an increase of cell proliferation; whereas 24 hrs after Nar stimulation a dose-dependent decrease in cell number is reported. E2 or BPA treatment reduces ERα protein and mRNA levels after 24 hrs. Contrarily, Nar stimulation does not alter ERα content but reduces ERα mRNA levels like other ligands. Co-stimulation experiments indicate that 48 hrs of Nar treatment prevents the E2-induced ERα degradation and hijacks the physiological ability of E2:ERα complex to regulate gene transcription. Mechanistically, Nar induces ERα protein accumulation by preventing proteasomal receptor degradation via persistent activation of p38/MAPK pathway. As a whole these data demonstrate that ERα intracellular concentration is an important target through which EDs hamper the hormonal milieu of E2 target cells driving cells to different outcomes or mimicking E2 even in the absence of the hormone.",PMC3930606

Atrazine and prochloraz had cell-type specific effects on CYP19 activity and estrogen production in co-culture. Atrazine induced CYP19 activity and estrogen production in H295R cells only, but did not affect overall estrogen production in co-culture, whereas prochloraz inhibited CYP19 activity exclusively in BeWo cells and reduced estrogen production in co-culture by almost 90%. In contrast, prochloraz did not affect estradiol or estrone production in BeWo cells in monoculture.

Scoliosis-like axial skeleton abnormalities, not normally observed in controls, were present in the F₁ and F₂ generations descended from the treated F₀ founders. Egg release and fertilization success were reduced in the TCDD lineage F₁ and F₂ generations. This reduction in fertility in the TCDD lineage F₂ generation could be attributed to alterations in the F₂ males.

In both situations, the in vitro potency of the 22 selected AR antagonists was too low to produce combined AR antagonistic effects at the concentrations found in human serum, although the high exposure scenario came quite close to measurable effects. Nevertheless, our analysis exposes an explanation gap which can only be bridged by conjuring up as yet undiscovered high potency AR antagonists or, alternatively, high exposures to unknown agents of average potency.",PMC3959774

Non-chemical exposures, including psychosocial stress, may disrupt the prenatal hormonal milieu as well. To date, only one published study has prospectively examined the relationship between exposure to prenatal stress and gender-specific play behavior during childhood, finding masculinized play behavior in girls who experienced high prenatal life events stress, but no associations in boys. Here we examine this question in a second prospective cohort from the Study for Future Families. Pregnant women completed questionnaires on stressful life events during pregnancy, and those who reported one or more events were considered ""stressed"". Families were recontacted several years later (mean age of index child: 4.9 years), and mothers completed a questionnaire including the validated Preschool Activities Inventory (PSAI), which measures sexually dimorphic play behavior. In sex-stratified analyses, after adjusting for child's age, parental attitudes toward gender-atypical play, age and sex of siblings, and other relevant covariates, girls (n=72) exposed to prenatal life events stress had higher scores on the PSAI masculine sub-scale (β=3.48, p=0.006) and showed a trend toward higher (more masculine) composite scores (β=2.63, p=0.08). By contrast, in males (n=74), there was a trend toward an association between prenatal stress and higher PSAI feminine sub-scale scores (β=2.23, p=0.10), but no association with masculine or composite scores. These data confirm previous findings in humans and animal models suggesting that prenatal stress is a non-chemical endocrine disruptor that may have androgenic effects on female fetuses and anti-androgenic effects on male fetuses.",PMC4098934

However, the mechanisms of action of these molecules on molluscs are still poorly understood. Investigation of the modifications of protein expression in organisms exposed to chemicals using proteomic methods can provide a broader and more comprehensive understanding of adverse impacts of pollution on organisms than conventional biochemical biomarkers (e.g., heat-shock proteins, metallothioneins, GST, EROD). In this study we have investigated the impacts of four chemicals, which exhibit different endocrine disrupting properties in vertebrates, on the proteome of the hermaphroditic freshwater pulmonate gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis after 21 days of exposure. Testosterone, tributyltin, chlordecone and cyproterone acetate were chosen as tested compounds as they can induce adverse effects on the reproduction of this snail. The 2D-DIGE method was used to identify proteins whose expression was affected by these compounds. In addition to modifying the expression of proteins involved in the structure and function of the cytoskeleton, chemicals had impacts on the expression of proteins involved in the reproduction of L. stagnalis. Exposure to 19.2 µg/L of chlordecone increased the abundance of ovipostatin, a peptide transmitted during mating through seminal fluid, which reduces oviposition in this species. The expression of yolk ferritin, the vitellogenin equivalent in L. stagnalis, was reduced after exposure to 94.2 ng Sn/L of tributyltin. The identification of yolk ferritin and the modification of its expression in snails exposed to chemicals were refined using western blot analysis. Our results showed that the tested compounds influenced the abundance of yolk ferritin in the reproductive organs. Alteration in proteins involved in reproductive pathways (e.g., ovipostatin and yolk ferritin) could constitute relevant evidence of interaction of EDCs with reproductive pathways that are under the control of the endocrine system of L. stagnalis.",PMC3867191

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds may disrupt this process, resulting in compromised reproductive physiology and behavior. To test the hypothesis that neonatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure can alter sex-specific postnatal Esr2 (Erβ) expression in brain regions fundamental to sociosexual behavior, we mapped Esr2 mRNA levels in the principal nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTp), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), anterior portion of the medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeA), super optic nucleus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and lateral habenula across postnatal days (PNDs) 0-19. Next, rat pups of both sexes were subcutaneously injected with 10 μg estradiol benzoate (EB), 50 μg/kg BPA (LBPA), or 50 mg/kg BPA (HBPA) over the first 3 days of life and Esr2 levels were quantified in each region of interest (ROI) on PNDs 4 and 10. EB exposure decreased Esr2 signal in most female ROIs and in the male PVN. In the BNSTp, Esr2 expression decreased in LBPA males and HBPA females on PND 10, thereby reversing the sex difference in expression. In the PVN, Esr2 mRNA levels were elevated in LBPA females, also resulting in a reversal of sexually dimorphic expression. In the MeA, BPA decreased Esr2 expression on PND 4. Collectively, these data demonstrate that region- and sex-specific Esr2 expression is vulnerable to neonatal BPA exposure in regions of the developing brain critical to sociosexual behavior in rat.",PMC3947720

We tested the hypothesis that prenatal treatment of rats with low doses of Aroclor 1221 (A1221), a weakly estrogenic polychlorinated biphenyl mix previously used in industry, or estradiol benzoate (EB), alters development of the hypothalamus in a sexually dimorphic manner and subsequently perturbs reproductive function. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected on embryonic days 16 and 18 with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide), A1221 (1 mg/kg), or EB (50 μg/kg). Developmental milestones were monitored, and on postnatal days 15, 30, 45, and 90, 1 male and 1 female per litter were euthanized. Because of their key roles in the mediation of steroid actions on reproductive function, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) were punched for a low-density quantitative PCR array of 48 neuroendocrine genes and analysis of DNA methylation of a subset of genes. Gestational exposure to A1221 or EB delayed the timing of puberty in males and disrupted estrous cyclicity in females. In the AVPV, 28 genes were affected by treatment in a developmental stage-specific manner, mostly in females, which exhibited a masculinized expression profile. This included 2 clock genes, Per2 and Arntl, implicating circadian circuits as being vulnerable to endocrine disruption. DNA methylation analysis of 2 genes, Per2 and Ar, showed no effect of EDCs and suggested alternative mechanisms for the altered mRNA levels. In the ARC, 12 genes were affected by treatment, mostly in males, again with dynamic developmental changes.

Within the Duisburg birth cohort study, we studied associations of prenatal exposure to PCDD/Fs and PCBs with parent-reported sexually dimorphic behavior in children. We measured lipid-based and WHO2005-TEQ (toxic equivalents established in 2005 by the World Health Organization)-standardized PCDD/Fs and PCBs in maternal blood samples and in early breast milk using gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. At the child's age of 6-8 years, parents (mostly mothers) reported sex-typical characteristics, preferred toys, and play activities using the Pre-School Activities Inventory (PSAI), which was used to derive feminine, masculine, and difference (feminine - masculine) scores. We estimated exposure-outcome associations using multivariate linear regression. A total of 91-109 children were included in this follow-up. Mean blood levels of summed WHO2005-TEQ-standardized dioxins (ΣPCDD/Fs) were 14.5 ± 6.4 pg/g blood lipids, and ΣPCBs were 6.9 ± 3.8 pg/g blood lipids, with similar values for milk lipids. Regression analyses revealed some highly significant interactions between sex and exposure-such as for ΣPCBs in milk, pronounced positive (boys: β = 3.24; CI = 1.35, 5.14) or negative (girls: β = -3.59; CI = -1.10, -6.08) associations with reported femininity. Less pronounced and mostly insignificant but consistent associations were found for the masculinity score, positive for boys and negative for girls.

We also assayed ICI 182,780, a strong estrogen antagonist. Chemicals to be assayed were initially examined for solubility and volatility to determine optimal assay conditions. For both EA and AEA determinations, a Range-Finder assay was conducted to determine the concentration range for testing, followed by a Comprehensive assay. Test substances with potentially positive results from an EA Comprehensive assay were subjected to an EA Confirmation assay that evaluated the ability of ICI 182,780 to reverse chemically induced MCF-7 cell proliferation. The AEA assays examined the ability of chemicals to decrease MCF-7 cell proliferation induced by nonsaturating concentrations of 17β-estradiol (E2), relative to ICI or raloxifene, also a strong estrogen antagonist. To be classified as having AEA, a saturating concentration of E2 had to significantly reverse the decrease in cell proliferation produced by the test substance in nonsaturating E2.

Here we investigate the possibility that estrogens also impact splicing decisions on estrogen responsive genes, such as that encoding ERα itself. Targeted PCR cloning was applied to identify six ERα mRNA variants in zebrafish. Sequencing revealed alternate use of transcription and translation start sites, multiple exon deletions, intron retention and alternate polyadenylation. As determined by quantitative (q)PCR, N-terminal mRNA variants predicting long (ERαA(L)) and short (ERα(S)) isoforms were differentially expressed by tissue-type, sex, stage of development and estrogen exposure. Whereas ERα(L) mRNA was diffusely distributed in liver, brain, heart, eye, and gonads, ERα(S) mRNA was preferentially expressed in liver (female>male) and ovary. Neither ERα(L) nor ERα(S) transcripts varied significantly during development, but 17β-estradiol selectively increased accumulation of ERα(S) mRNA (∼170-fold by 120 hpf), an effect mimicked by bisphenol-A and diethylstilbestrol. Significantly, a C-truncated variant (ERα(S)-Cx) lacking most of the ligand binding and AF-2 domains was transcribed exclusively from the short isoform promoter and was similar to ERα(S) in its tissue-, stage- and estrogen inducible expression. These results support the idea that promoter choice and alternative splicing of the esr1 gene of zebrafish are part of the autoregulatory mechanism by which estrogen modulates subsequent ERα expression, and further suggest that environmental estrogens could exert some of their toxic effects by altering the relative abundance of structurally and functionally distinct ERα isoforms.",PMC3862120

In the current study, we exposed female Prussian carp to artificial feed, supplemented with five doses of dietary Pb (0, 1 (control), 8, 13, 24, and 49 mg/kg) over either a 24-month period or a 12-month period, followed by further 12 months where the fish were fed the control diet. Periodically, oocyte maturation, gonadosomatic index (GSI), ability to secret luteinizing hormone (LH) as well as gonad Pb concentrations were measured. It was found that the reproductive system of the female Prussian carp is not indifferent to chronic exposure to lead. The negative effect was manifested by a decrease in the GSI after 12 months despite the fact that a higher proportion of oocytes at more advanced maturity stages were concurrently observed. After 12 months of exposure, the effect on LH secretion varied according to the dose. In the group exposed to the lowest dose (8 mg/kg), LH decreased spontaneously, and in the groups exposed to the highest two doses (24 and 48 mg/kg), a significantly higher LHRH-A-stimulated LH secretion was observed. After 24 months of lead exposure, the effects on oocyte maturation and size and on GSI values were not pronounced. Analysis of the effect of lead exposure on LH secretion showed that the relationships were similar to those observed after 12 months but nonsignificant. During chronic a 24-month period exposure to Pb, Prussian carp female appears to acclimate to Pb doses used in the experiment. After 12 months of exposure and 12 months of depuration, the levels of spontaneous and stimulated LH secretion observed in all the groups were similar to the control, which is evidence that depuration eliminates the previously observed effects of exposure to lead. Lead is easily accumulated in the ovary, reaching a fivefold higher level (0.8 mg/kg tissue) compared to the control(0.15 mg/kg tissue), but after discontinuation of exposure, this organ is quickly depurated. The results indicate that environmental Pb can be a potent endocrine disruptor affecting ovarian steroidogenesis, gametogenesis, and ovulation, which may lead to adverse impacts on fish reproduction and population density and that female Prussian carp become resistant to the negative effects of lead with advancing age, and their organs cope by reaching a state of homeostasis.",PMC3918121

Previous studies indicate that other EDCs have species-dependent effects. Furthermore, some EDCs are known to have different effects in different strains within the same species. Little information, however, is known about whether the effects of BPA on the ovary differ by strain. Previous studies have shown that BPA inhibits follicle growth, induces atresia, and inhibits steroidogenesis and expression of steroidogenic enzymes in antral follicles from adult FVB mice. Thus, this study was designed to expand previous work by testing the hypothesis that mouse strain may differentially affect the susceptibility of adult antral follicles to BPA-induced toxicity. To test this hypothesis, antral follicles were mechanically isolated from adult FVB, CD-1, and C57BL/6 mice, individually cultured for 6-120 h and treated with either vehicle control (dimethylsulfoxide) or various concentrations of BPA (1.0 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml, or 100 μg/ml). After culture, media were subjected to measurements of hormone production via ELISA, and follicles were subjected to real-time PCR for analysis of genes known to regulate steroidogenesis, the cell cycle, and atresia.

Recent reports provide evidence for the presence of EDCs in commercially available bottled water, including steroid receptor agonists and antagonists. However, since these findings are based on biological data the causative chemicals remain unidentified and, therefore, inaccessible for toxicological evaluation. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activity of bottled water and to identify the causative steroid receptor antagonists. We evaluated the antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activity of 18 bottled water products in reporter gene assays for human estrogen receptor alpha and androgen receptor. Using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos), we acquired corresponding analytical data. We combined the biological and chemical information to determine the exact mass of the tentative steroid receptor antagonist. Further MS(n) experiments elucidated the molecule's structure and enabled its identification. We detected significant antiestrogenicity in 13 of 18 products. 16 samples were antiandrogenic inhibiting the androgen receptor by up to 90%. Nontarget chemical analysis revealed that out of 24520 candidates present in bottled water one was consistently correlated with the antagonistic activity. By combining experimental and in silico MS(n) data we identified this compound as di(2-ethylhexyl) fumarate (DEHF). We confirmed the identity and biological activity of DEHF and additional isomers of dioctyl fumarate and maleate using authentic standards. Since DEHF is antiestrogenic but not antiandrogenic we conclude that additional, yet unidentified EDCs must contribute to the antagonistic effect of bottled water. Applying a novel approach to combine biological and chemical analysis this is the first study to identify so far unknown EDCs in bottled water. Notably, dioctyl fumarates and maleates have been overlooked by science and regulation to date. This illustrates the need to identify novel toxicologically relevant compounds to establish a more holistic picture of the human exposome.",PMC3756062

As the actions of steroids are mediated through the binding of steroid receptors, most studies of EDCs have assumed that they too elicit their effects by binding steroid receptors. We tested an alternative hypothesis, namely that EDCs elicit their effects during embryonic development by disrupting the metabolism of maternally derived steroids, thereby allowing maternally derived steroids to bind steroid receptors and elicit effects. Specifically, we examined the ability of the EDC, bisphenol-A (BPA) to inhibit the normal metabolism of oestradiol during the first nine days of embryonic development in the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). We found that, when BPA was present, oestrogen metabolism was inhibited when compared to control eggs. In particular, the formation of oestrone sulfate was blocked in BPA-treated eggs. We postulate that the oestrogenic effects of EDCs may be driven, at least in part, by inappropriate oestrogen signalling. The retention of oestrogens at points of development when they would normally be metabolized to inactive forms might also help explain low-dose effects frequently reported for EDCs.",PMC3768319

The estuary is also experiencing increasing salinity through climate change and water redirection. To evaluate the impacts of hypersaline conditions on bifenthrin toxicity in anadromous salmonids of the San Francisco Bay Delta (CA, USA), a 14-d laboratory exposure was performed using 2 strains of Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout and steelhead) acclimated to freshwater and to 8 g/L and 17 g/L salinity. The fish were then exposed to nominal concentrations of 0 µg/L, 0.1 µg/L, and 1.5 µg/L bifenthrin. Rainbow trout exhibited significant mortality following exposure to 1.5 µg/L (1.07 ± 0.35 µg/L measured) bifenthrin in freshwater. Elevated levels of Na⁺ /K⁺ adenosine triphosphatase α1A mRNA subunit expression was observed in the gill of rainbow trout acclimated to hypersaline conditions relative to freshwater animals. No significant difference was noted in Na⁺ /K⁺ adenosine triphosphatase subunit levels in brains of either strain in freshwater or hypersaline conditions. Likewise, significant differences were not observed in plasma vitellogenin or steroid hormone concentrations in either strain whether maintained in freshwater or saltwater. Saltwater acclimation significantly reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-catalyzed biotransformation of bifenthrin in liver microsomes of rainbow trout but not of steelhead. The present study showed that, relative to steelhead, rainbow trout have different responses to bifenthrin acute toxicity as well as different rates of hepatic bifenthrin biotransformation and regulation of Na⁺ /K⁺ adenosine triphosphatase subunits in gills. These data indicate that significant differences exist between the strains and that animal life history may have important effects on the susceptibility of each strain to environmental contaminants.",PMC4104814

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation and MET aberrations occur in a subset of NSCLC. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase/MET have been shown to be inhibited by the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib. Recently, crizotinib was shown to decrease testosterone in males. Herein, we describe the effects of crizotinib on multiple hormonal axes. Seven consecutive patients with NSCLC who were receiving crizotinib as part of their standard care were evaluated for hormonal disruptions. Primary hypogonadism was detected in 4/5 of males, whereas mildly elevated prolactin was observed in 4/7 patients. Hypocalcemia was observed in 3/7 patients. Interestingly, 5/7 patients had elevated levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, and the remaining 2 individuals had levels that were near the upper limits of the normal range. Because of cellular cross-talk between MET and IGF-1 signaling, elevated IGF-1 levels induced by crizotinib treatment may have implications for long-term drug efficacy. Furthermore, this finding suggests a potential avenue of therapeutic synergy, namely coordinate inhibition of the MET and IGF-1 signaling pathways. Finally, as crizotinib has been recently approved, it is prudent to check hormone and calcium biomarkers and correct noted deficiencies for improved outcomes and quality of life.",PMC4055562

Antral follicles from wild-type and Ahr knock-out (AhrKO) mice were cultured for 96h. Follicle diameters and estradiol levels then were compared in wild-type and AhrKO follicles ± BPA (0.004-438μM). BPA inhibited follicle growth (110-438μM) and decreased estradiol levels (43.8-438μM) in wild-type and AhrKO follicles. However, at BPA 110μM, inhibition of growth in AhrKO follicles was attenuated compared to wild-type follicles.

Adult male mice were administered food containing 0%, 0.01% or 0.1% DEHP and then testes were analyzed. The results showed that a slight but significant spermatogenic disturbance appeared in the 0.1% DEHP group but not in the 0.01% DEHP group at 8 weeks.

Gestational exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics since the 1950s, has been reported to alter a variety of physiological processes in adulthood.

To test this hypothesis, we utilized two different mouse models of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6J mice (chronic progressive) and in SJL/J mice (relapsing-remitting). Dams were exposed to physiologically relevant levels of BPA in drinking water starting 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing until weaning of offspring. EAE was induced in adult offspring. No significant changes in EAE incidence, progression, or severity were observed with BPA exposure, despite changes in cytokine production by autoreactive T cells.

Female fetuses were collected at day 110 of gestation, from dams exposed continuously until, and after mating, by grazing in pastures treated with sewage sludge as a fertiliser (TT) or in control fields treated with inorganic fertiliser (CC). In addition, in a cross-over design, fetal ovaries were collected from dams maintained on sludge pastures up to the time of mating but then transferred to control pastures (TC) and, reciprocally, those transferred from control to treated pastures at mating (CT). On examination, the proportion of type 1a follicles (activating primordial follicles) was significantly lower in animals from the CT groups compared with CC and TT groups (P<0.05). Of the 23 ovarian gene transcripts studied, 14 were altered in the ovaries of exposed fetuses (CT, TC, and TT) relative to controls, with the largest number of changes observed in cross-exposure pattern groups (CT or TC). Continuous EC exposure (TT) produced fewer transcript alterations and only two genes (INHBA and GSN) presented differential profiles between CC and TT. Fetal ovarian proteome analysis (2-DE gels) showed, across all exposure groups, 86 differentially expressed protein spots compared to controls. Animals in the CT group exhibited the highest number (53) while TC and TT presented the same number of affected protein spots (42). Fetal ovarian proteins with altered expression included MVP (major vault protein) and several members of the heat-shock family (HSPA4L, HSP90AA1 and HSF1). The present findings indicate that continuous maternal EC exposure before and during gestation, are less deleterious for fetal ovarian development than a change in maternal EC exposure between pre and post-conception. The pathways by which the ovary responds to this chemical stress were common in TT, CT, TC exposed foetuses.

Rats were exposed daily to BPA from conception until day 30 or 100. At day 30, BPA-affected enamel exhibited hypomineralization similar to human MIH. Scanning electron microscopy and elemental analysis revealed an abnormal accumulation of organic material in erupted enamel. BPA-affected enamel had an abnormal accumulation of exogenous albumin in the maturation stage. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and luciferase reporter assays revealed increased expression of enamelin but decreased expression of kallikrein 4 (protease essential for removing enamel proteins) via transcriptional regulation. Data suggest that BPA exerts its effects on amelogenesis by disrupting normal protein removal from the enamel matrix. Interestingly, in 100-day-old rats, erupting incisor enamel was normal, suggesting amelogenesis is only sensitive to MIH-causing agents during a specific time window during development (as reported for human MIH).

Young adult cattle with low vs. high numbers of antral follicles ≥ 3 mm in diameter in follicular waves also have fewer preantral follicles and decreased fertility. This underscores the importance of understanding the factors that regulate early follicular development and establish the ovarian follicular reserve, but little is known about how the follicular reserve is first established. In ruminants and humans, follicles form during fetal life, but there is a gap (about 50 d in cattle) between the appearance of the first primordial follicles and the first growing, primary follicles. In this review we present evidence that in cattle, fetal ovarian steroids (i.e., estradiol and progesterone) are negative regulators of both follicle formation and of the acquisition by newly formed follicles of the capacity to activate (i.e., initiate growth). The results indicate that capacity to activate is linked to the completion of meiotic prophase I by the oocyte. The inhibitory effects of estradiol on follicle activation were found to be reversible and correlated with inhibition of the progression of meiotic prophase I. Fetal bovine ovaries produce steroid hormones and production varies considerably during gestation and in a pattern consistent with the hypothesis that they inhibit follicle formation and capacity of newly formed follicles to activate in vivo. However, little was known about how steroid production is regulated. In our studies, both LH and FSH stimulated progesterone and estradiol production by ovarian pieces in vitro. The addition of testosterone to the culture medium enhanced estradiol production, especially when FSH was also present, but inhibited progesterone production, even in the presence of gonadotropins. Evidence is also presented for effects of maternal nutrition and health and for potential effects of estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the size of the ovarian follicular reserve established during fetal life. In summary, fetal ovarian steroids may be important regulators of the early stages of follicular development in cattle. Therefore, external factors that alter steroid production or action may affect the size of the ovarian follicular reserve.",PMC5418586

Here, we provide evidence that maternal exposure during pregnancy to environmentally relevant doses of BPA (2, 20, and 200 µg/kg/d) in mice induces sex-specific, dose-dependent (linear and curvilinear), and brain region-specific changes in expression of genes encoding estrogen receptors (ERs; ERα and ERβ) and estrogen-related receptor-γ in juvenile offspring. Concomitantly, BPA altered mRNA levels of epigenetic regulators DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3A in the juvenile cortex and hypothalamus, paralleling changes in estrogen-related receptors. Importantly, changes in ERα and DNMT expression in the cortex (males) and hypothalamus (females) were associated with DNA methylation changes in the ERα gene. BPA exposure induced persistent, largely sex-specific effects on social and anxiety-like behavior, leading to disruption of sexually dimorphic behaviors. Although postnatal maternal care was altered in mothers treated with BPA during pregnancy, the effects of in utero BPA were not found to be mediated by maternal care. However, our data suggest that increased maternal care may partially attenuate the effects of in utero BPA on DNA methylation.

High predictive accuracy was achieved for ERα binding affinity (MTL R(2)=0.71, STL R(2)=0.73).

One compound of great concern is trenbolone, which is widely used as a growth promoter in the cattle industry in many parts of the world. The aim of this study was to test how short-term (21-day) exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of 17β-trenbolone (measured concentration 6 ng/L) affects reproductive behaviour and fin morphology in the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). The mosquitofish is a sexually dimorphic livebearer with males inseminating females using their modified anal fin, the gonopodium, as an intromittent organ. Although the species has a coercive mating system, females are able to exert some control over the success of male mating attempts by selectively associating with, or avoiding, certain males over others. We found that females exposed to trenbolone approached males less and spent more time swimming away from males than non-exposed (control) females. By contrast, we found no difference in the behaviour of exposed and non-exposed males. Furthermore, exposure did not affect the anal fin morphology of males or females. This is the first study to demonstrate that exposure to an androgenic EDC can impair female (but not male) behaviour. Our study illustrates how anthropogenic contaminants can have sex-specific effects, and highlights the need to examine the behavioural responses of environmental contaminants in both sexes.",PMC3643955

The placenta is expected to be an effective barrier protecting the developing embryo against some endocrine disruptors (EDs) circulating in maternal blood. The current study was designed to assess in utero exposure levels of non-persistent organic pollutants (non-POPs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Chinese newborns and potential role of placenta barrier against fetal exposure to these commonly-used environmental endocrine disruptors. A total of 230 newborn-mother pairs were enrolled during 2010-2011, 201 pairs of which were recruited from Shanghai, and the other 29 pairs came from Wenzhou. Maternal blood, cord blood, and meconium specimens were collected in the subject population from Shanghai and analyzed for non-POPs, including mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), octylphenol (OP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP). A total of 19 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) congeners, which belong to POPs, were detected in maternal and cord blood specimens from the other 29 pairs. Fetal-maternal ratios (F-M ratios) and regression coefficients were presented to assess potential function of placenta on barricading the mother/fetal transfer of these EDs. Concentrations of the detected non-POPs in cord blood samples were approximately 20% lower than those in maternal blood, and regression coefficients of which were all over 0.80. In contrast, PBDEs levels in cord blood samples were significantly higher than those in maternal blood. MEHP levels in meconium were much higher than those in cord blood samples, and highly correlated. Therefore, observations demonstrated that the placental barrier slightly decreased the fetal exposure to most non-POPs, while PBDEs seemed to be totally transferred across the placenta and finally reached the fetus. For in utero exposure assessment of Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), MEHP level in meconium may be a useful biomarker.",PMC3646826

Their popularity is partly due to their alleged safety compared to the older organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides. Application of pyrethroids is expanding because of recent increases in the level of pest infestations--such as bed bugs--and the decreased susceptibility of target species to many pest control products. Pyrethroid residues have been documented in homes, child care centres and food. While pyrethroids are considered of low health risk for humans, their increased use is of concern. Our current understanding of the adverse effects of pyrethroids derives mainly from studies of short-term effects in laboratory animals, case reports of self- and accidental poisonings, and high-dose occupational exposures, for which the levels and formulations of pyrethroid products differ from those relevant for long-term exposure in the general population. The available data suggest that the reproductive and nervous systems, endocrine signalling pathways, and early childhood development may be targets for adverse effects in the case of repeated exposure to pyrethroid formulations. Given uncertainty about the existence of long-term health effects of exposure to pyrethroids, particularly under realistic scenarios, we should be cautious when promoting pyrethroid products as safe methods for pest control.",PMC6975195

Previous work has shown that gestational exposure to PCBs cause changes in reproductive neuroendocrine processes. Here we extended work farther down the life spectrum and tested the hypothesis that early life exposure to Aroclor 1221 (A1221), a mixture of primarily estrogenic PCBs, results in sexually dimorphic aging-associated alterations to reproductive parameters in rats, and gene expression changes in hypothalamic nuclei that regulate reproductive function. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were injected on gestational days 16 and 18 with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide), A1221 (1 mg/kg), or estradiol benzoate (50 μg/kg). Developmental parameters, estrous cyclicity (females), and timing of reproductive senescence were monitored in the offspring through 9 months of age. Expression of 48 genes was measured in 3 hypothalamic nuclei: the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), arcuate nucleus (ARC), and median eminence (females only) by real-time RT-PCR. Serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol were assayed in the same animals. In males, A1221 had no effects; however, prenatal estradiol benzoate increased serum estradiol, gene expression in the AVPV (1 gene), and ARC (2 genes) compared with controls. In females, estrous cycles were longer in the A1221-exposed females throughout the life cycle. Gene expression was not affected in the AVPV, but significant changes were caused by A1221 in the ARC and median eminence as a function of cycling status. Bionetwork analysis demonstrated fundamental differences in physiology and gene expression between cycling and acyclic females independent of treatment. Thus, gestational exposure to biologically relevant levels of estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals has sexually dimorphic effects, with an altered transition to reproductive aging in female rats but relatively little effect in males.",PMC3740483

Because of its estrogenic properties, there is increasing concern relative to risks from exposures during critical periods of early organ differentiation. Prenatal BPA treatment in sheep results in low birth weight, hypergonadotropism, and ovarian cycle disruptions. This study tested the hypothesis that gestational exposure to bisphenol A, at an environmentally relevant dose, induces early perturbations in the ovarian transcriptome (mRNA and microRNA). Pregnant Suffolk ewes were treated with bisphenol A (0.5 mg/kg, sc, daily, produced ∼2.6 ng/mL of unconjugated BPA in umbilical arterial samples of BPA treated fetuses approaching median levels of BPA measured in maternal circulation) from days 30 to 90 of gestation. Expression of steroidogenic enzymes, steroid/gonadotropin receptors, key ovarian regulators, and microRNA biogenesis components were measured by RT-PCR using RNA derived from fetal ovaries collected on gestational days 65 and 90. An age-dependent effect was evident in most steroidogenic enzymes, steroid receptors, and key ovarian regulators. Prenatal BPA increased Cyp19 and 5α-reductase expression in day 65, but not day 90, ovaries. Fetal ovarian microRNA expression was altered by prenatal BPA with 45 down-regulated (>1.5-fold) at day 65 and 11 down-regulated at day 90 of gestation. These included microRNAs targeting Sry-related high-mobility-group box (SOX) family genes, kit ligand, and insulin-related genes.

The PFAA compounds perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) are found globally in humans; because they readily cross the placental barrier, in utero exposure may be a cause for concern. We investigated whether in utero exposure to PFOA and PFOS affects semen quality, testicular volume, and reproductive hormone levels. We recruited 169 male offspring (19-21 years of age) from a pregnancy cohort established in Aarhus, Denmark, in 1988-1989, corresponding to 37.6% of the eligible sons. Each man provided a semen sample and a blood sample. Semen samples were analyzed for sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility, and morphology, and blood samples were used to measure reproductive hormones. As a proxy for in utero exposure, PFOA and PFOS were measured in maternal blood samples from pregnancy week 30. Multivariable linear regression analysis suggested that in utero exposure to PFOA was associated with lower adjusted sperm concentration (ptrend = 0.01) and total sperm count (ptrend = 0.001) and with higher adjusted levels of luteinizing hormone (ptrend = 0.03) and follicle-stimulating hormone (ptrend = 0.01). PFOS did not appear to be associated with any of the outcomes assessed, before or after adjustment. The results suggest that in utero exposure to PFOA may affect adult human male semen quality and reproductive hormone levels.",PMC3620740

The current study was designed to determine if a mixture of plastic derived endocrine disruptor compounds bisphenol-A (BPA), bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) at two different doses promoted epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease and associated DNA methylation epimutations in sperm. Gestating F0 generation females were exposed to either the ""plastics"" or ""lower dose plastics"" mixture during embryonic days 8 to 14 of gonadal sex determination and the incidence of adult onset disease was evaluated in F1 and F3 generation rats. There were significant increases in the incidence of total disease/abnormalities in F1 and F3 generation male and female animals from plastics lineages. Pubertal abnormalities, testis disease, obesity, and ovarian disease (primary ovarian insufficiency and polycystic ovaries) were increased in the F3 generation animals. Kidney and prostate disease were only observed in the direct fetally exposed F1 generation plastic lineage animals. Analysis of the plastics lineage F3 generation sperm epigenome previously identified 197 differential DNA methylation regions (DMR) in gene promoters, termed epimutations. A number of these transgenerational DMR form a unique direct connection gene network and have previously been shown to correlate with the pathologies identified. Observations demonstrate that a mixture of plastic derived compounds, BPA and phthalates, can promote epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease.

Studies show that EDCs can cause irreversible changes in tissue formation, decreased reproductive potential, obesity, and cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers an atrazine concentration of ≤ 3 ppb in drinking water safe for consumption. The specific adverse human health effects associated with a developmental atrazine exposure and the underlying genetic mechanisms of these effects are not well defined. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations to establish toxicity. Morphological, transcriptomic, and protein alterations were then assessed at 72h postfertilization following developmental atrazine exposure at 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb. A significant increase in head length was observed in all three atrazine treatments. Transcriptomic profiles revealed 21, 62, and 64 genes with altered expression in the 0.3, 3, and 30 ppb atrazine treatments, respectively. Altered genes were associated with neuroendocrine and reproductive system development, function, and disease; cell cycle control; and carcinogenesis. There was a significant overlap (42 genes) between the 3 and 30 ppb differentially expressed gene lists, with two of these genes (CYP17A1 and SAMHD1) present in all three atrazine treatments. Increased transcript levels were translated to significant upregulation in protein expression. Overall, this study identifies genetic and molecular targets altered in response to a developmental atrazine exposure to further define the biological pathways and mechanisms of toxicity.",PMC3595526

Some rodent studies have suggested that BPA can exert detrimental effects on brain development. However as rodent models cannot be relied on to predict consequences of human exposure to BPA during development, it is important to investigate the effects of BPA on non-human primate brain development. Previous research suggests that BPA preferentially targets dopamine neurons in ventral mesencephalon and glutamatergic neurons in hippocampus, so the present work examined the susceptibility of these systems to low dose BPA exposure at the fetal and juvenile stages of development in non-human primates. Exposure of pregnant rhesus monkeys to relatively low levels of BPA during the final 2 months of gestation, induced abnormalities in fetal ventral mesencephalon and hippocampus. Specifically, light microscopy revealed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing (dopamine) neurons in the midbrain of BPA-exposed fetuses and electron microscopy identified a reduction in spine synapses in the CA1 region of hippocampus. In contrast, administration of BPA to juvenile vervet monkeys (14-18 months of age) was without effect on these indices, or on dopamine and serotonin concentrations in striatum and prefrontal cortex, or on performance of a cognitive task that tests working memory capacity. These data indicate that BPA exerts an age-dependent detrimental impact on primate brain development, at blood levels within the range measured in humans having only environmental contact with BPA.",PMC3660149

BFRs may persist in the environment and have been detected in wildlife, humans and indoor dust and air. Some BFRs have demonstrated endocrine and reproductive effects in animals, but human studies are limited. In this exploratory study, we measured serum hormone levels and flame retardant concentrations [31 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congeners and 6 alternate flame retardants] in house dust from men recruited through a US infertility clinic. PBDE congeners in dust were grouped by commercial mixtures (i.e. penta-, octa- and deca-BDE). In multivariable linear regression models adjusted by age and body mass index (BMI), significant positive associations were found between house dust concentrations of pentaBDEs and serum levels of free T4, total T3, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), along with an inverse association with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). There were also positive associations of octaBDE concentrations with serum free T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone and an inverse association of decaBDE concentrations with testosterone. Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) was associated with decreased SHBG and increased free androgen index. Dust concentrations of bis-tribromophenoxyethane (BTBPE) and tetrabromo-diethylhexylphthalate (TBPH) were positively associated with total T3. These findings are consistent with our previous report of associations between PBDEs (BDE 47, 99 and 100) in house dust and hormone levels in men, and further suggest that exposure to contaminants in indoor dust may be leading to endocrine disruption in men.",PMC3572297

To predict hormonal balance disruption on the basis of data on aromatase activity and mRNA level modulation obtained in vitro on granulosa cells, we developed a mathematical model for the last gonadal steps of the sex steroid synthesis pathway. The model can simulate the ovarian synthesis and secretion of estrone, estradiol, androstenedione, and testosterone, and their response to endocrine disruption.

It is not known, however, whether such early gestational and/or lactational exposure can influence the later adult-type Leydig cell phenotype. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to dibutyl phthalate (DBP; from gestational day (GD) 14.5 to postnatal day (PND) 6) or diethylstilbestrol (DES; from GD14.5 to GD16.5) during a short gestational/lactational window, and male offspring subsequently analysed for various postnatal testicular parameters. All offspring remained in good health throughout the study. Maternal xenobiotic treatment appeared to modify specific Leydig cell gene expression in male offspring, particularly during the dynamic phase of mid-puberty, with serum INSL3 concentrations showing that these compounds led to a faster attainment of peak values, and a modest acceleration of the pubertal trajectory. Part of this effect appeared to be due to a treatment-specific impact on Leydig cell proliferation during puberty for both xenobiotics. Taken together, these results support the notion that maternal exposure to certain xenobiotics can also influence the development of the adult-type Leydig cell population, possibly through an effect on the Leydig stem cell population.",PMC3739150

Adult animals have reduced number of ovulations and abnormal follicular composition associated with altered gene expression and DNA methylation patterns. To test the hypothesis that the ovarian epigenomic changes induced by MXC are detectable following the exposure period, leading to altered gene expression by adulthood, we conducted a targeted genome-wide methylation study using Nimblegen 3x720K CpG Island Plus RefSeq Promoter Arrays. Control (vehicle), low-dose MXC (20 μg/kg/day), or high-dose MXC (100 mg/kg/day) treatments were administered between Embryonic Day 19 and Postnatal Day (PND) 7. Ovaries were collected at PND 7 immediately after exposure or at adulthood, PND 60. Array hybridizations were conducted with genomic DNA after methylated DNA immunoprecipitation and the array data were analyzed. DNA methylation events were functionally annotated, and candidate loci common to all the treatments or unique to some treatments were identified. Specific loci encoding signaling molecules such as the regulatory subunit p85 of phosphoinositide-3-kinase, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene, insulin receptor, and forkhead box protein O3 were identified to be hypermethylated in MXC-treated ovaries at PND 7 and/or PND 60. Examination of gene expression changes with TaqMan low-density arrays revealed that nearly 25% of the genes that were assayed were downregulated.

Among a sample of 26 609 partners of totally infertile women undergoing an assisted reproductive technology (ART) procedures in the whole of France over a 17-year period, there was a continuous decrease in semen concentration of about 1.9% per year and a significant decrease in the percentage with morphologically normal forms but no global trend for motility. A global decrease in human sperm quality is still debated as geographical differences have been shown, and many criticisms have risen concerning studies with small and biased study populations or inappropriate statistical methodology. However, growing biological, toxicological, experimental and human exposure data support the endocrine disruptors' hypothesis assuming that fetal exposure to endocrine disruptors could impair reproductive outcomes. This was a retrospective and descriptive study using data registered by Fivnat, the professional association in charge of statistics for ART in France during the 1989-2005 study period. Data were provided by 126 main ART centres over the whole metropolitan territory. The source population included 154 712 men, aged 18-70, who were partners of couples undergoing their first ART cycle and for whom semen quality indicators (concentration, total motility and percentage of morphologically normal forms), measured on fresh ejaculated semen, were available. The study population was 26 609 partners of women who had both tubes either absent or blocked. The temporal trends for each indicator of semen quality were modelled using a generalized additive model that allowed for nonlinear relationships between variables and were adjusted for season and age. In-depth sensitivity analyses included the reiteration of the analysis on data from a second spermiogram available for each man and on another subsample of men diagnosed as fertile. Variables such as centre, technique (standard in vitro fertilization or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) and an interaction factor between technique and time were also included in the model. There was a significant and continuous decrease in sperm concentration of 32.2% [26.3-36.3] during the study period. Projections indicate that concentration for a 35-year-old man went from an average of 73.6 million/ml [69.0-78.4] in 1989 to 49.9 million/ml [43.5-54.7] in 2005. A significant, but not quantifiable, decrease in the percentage of sperm with morphologically normal forms along the 17-year period was also observed. There was no global trend but a slight, significant increase in total motility between 1994 and 1998 was observed. The results were robust after sensitivity analysis. Socioeconomic status could not be controlled for. Despite universal access to medical services in France, couples undergoing ART are expected to have a higher educational level on average compared with those of the general population. Therefore, the real values in the general population could be slightly lower than those presented and the decrease possibly stronger, as the population study is less likely to smoke or be overweight, two factors known to impair semen quality. As the men were selected without a priori knowledge regarding their semen quality characteristics, the results are expected to be close to the values in the general French population. The very large sample size and the robustness of the results confer great statistical power and credibility to the results. To our knowledge, it is the first study concluding a severe and general decrease in sperm concentration and morphology at the scale of a whole country over a substantial period. This constitutes a serious public health warning. The link with the environment particularly needs to be determined.",PMC4042534

However, little is known about the effects of MEHP on ovarian antral follicles. Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that MEHP inhibits follicle growth via oxidative stress pathways. The data indicate that MEHP increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and inhibits follicle growth in antral follicles, whereas N-acetylcysteine (NAC; an antioxidant) restores ROS levels to control levels and rescues follicles from MEHP-induced inhibition of follicle growth. To further analyze the mechanism by which MEHP induces oxidative stress and inhibits follicle growth, the expression and activities of various key antioxidant enzymes (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase [SOD1], glutathione peroxidase [GPX], and catalase [CAT]) and the expression of key cell-cycle regulators (Ccnd2, Ccne1, and Cdk4) and apoptotic regulators (Bcl-2 and Bax) were compared in control and MEHP-treated follicles. The data indicate that MEHP inhibits the expression and activities of SOD1 and GPX; does not inhibit Cat expression; inhibits the expression of Ccnd2, Ccne1, Cdk4, and Bcl-2; but increases the expression of Bax compared to controls. Furthermore, NAC blocks these toxic effects of MEHP. Collectively, these data suggest that MEHP induces oxidative stress by disrupting the activities of antioxidant enzymes.

Relative to controls, males exposed to the two upper but not the lowest dose of BPA demonstrated similar impairments in spatial learning, increased anxiety and reduced exploratory behaviors as ethinyl estradiol-exposed males, while females exposed to ethinyl estradiol, but not to BPA, consistently exhibited masculinized spatial abilities. We also determined whether dams maintained chronically on the upper dose of BPA contained environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA in their blood. While serum concentrations of unconjugated BPA in controls were below the minimum level of detection, those from dams on the BPA diet were comparable (5.48±2.07 ng/ml) to concentrations that have been observed in humans.

In this study we have developed a bacterial based detoxification system using a non-pathogen Rhodococcus pyridinivorans K408 strain. Following 5 days treatment of ZEA with R. pyridinivorans K408 strain HPLC analyses showed an 87.21% ZEA-degradation efficiency of the bacterial enzyme systems. In another approach, the strain biotransformation ability has also been confirmed by a bioluminescent version of the yeast estrogen screening system (BLYES), which detected an 81.75% of biodegradability of ZEA, in a good agreement with the chemical analyses. Furthermore, the capacity of R. pyridinivorans to eliminate the estrogenic effects of ZEA was tested by using an immature uterotrophic assay. Prepubertal female rats were treated with vehicle (olive oil), 17β-estradiol, ZEA (0.1-1-5-10 mg/kg body weight) and LB broth containing 500 mg/l ZEA that has already been incubated with or without Rhodococcus pyridinivorans K408 strain. Uterine weights were measured and the mRNA level changes relating to apelin, aquaporin 5, complement component 2, and calbindin-3 genes were measured by qRT-PCR. These genes represent the major pathways that are affected by estromimetic compounds. Zearalenone feeding significantly increased the uterus weight in a dose dependent manner and at the same time upregulated complement component 2 and calbindin-3 expression as well as decreased apelin and aquaporin 5 mRNA levels comparable to that seen in 17β-estradiol exposed rats. In contrast, LB broth in which ZEA was incubated with Rhodococcus pyridinivorans K408 prior to the feeding did not display any estrogenic effect neither on uterine weight nor on the expression of estrogen-regulated genes. Consequently, the identification of Rhodococcus pyridinivorans K408 strain in ZEA biodegradation proved to be a very efficient biological tool that is able to eliminate the complete estrogenic effects of ZEA. It is also remarkable that this biotransformation pathway of ZEA did not result in any residual estrogenic effects.",PMC3458049

We assessed non-monotonic dose-response by adding a quadratic term to a simple linear regression model. Except at the 500,000 μg/kg/day dose, DEHP stimulated an increase in maternal and fetal serum testosterone and increased anogenital distance (AGD). Non-monotonic dose-response curves were noted for AGD and maternal, and testis testosterone (P values 0.013-0.021). Because data from our highest dose (500,000 μg/kg/day) did not differ significantly from controls, this dose could have been incorrectly assumed to be the NOAEL had we only tested very high doses, as is typical in studies for regulatory agencies.",PMC3543148

The aim of this case-control study was to investigate the association between fetal exposure to persistent organochlorine pollutants (POP) and the risk for hypospadias. The Southern Sweden Maternity Cohort (SSMC) contains serum samples collected in early pregnancy among women in Southern Sweden. Linkages with the Medical Birth Register, the Malformation Register and the In-patient Register resulted in 390 SSMC mothers who had given birth to a boy with hypospadias in year 1986-2002 (mean 1995). For 237 of these (cases) sufficient amounts of serum for the chemical analyses were available. For each case, a control boy from the SSMC was randomly selected, matched for maternal age, birth year, parity and maternal smoking. PCB-153, p,p'-DDE and hexachlorbenzene (HCB) were used as biomarkers for POP exposure. The exposures were categorized into quartiles based on the distributions among the controls. There were no statistically significant trends between the a priori categorisation of the exposure variables and the risk for hypospadias. However, when the upper HCB quartile (>26 ng/ml) was compared to the other quartiles an odds ratio of 1.65 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.69) was obtained. p,p'-DDE levels above median (>1.0 ng/ml) compared to levels below 0.1 ng/ml gave an OR of 1.69 (95% CI 0.97 to 2.93).

Many of these endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) exhibit estrogenic activity and can interfere with sexual development and reproductive physiology. More recently, also chemicals with different modes of action (MOAs), such as antiestrogenic, androgenic and antiandrogenic EDCs, have been shown to be present in the environment. However, to date EDC-research primarily focuses on exposure to EDCs with just one MOA, while studies examining the effects of simultaneous exposure to EDCs with different MOAs are rare, although they would reflect more real, natural exposure situations. In the present study the combined effects of estrogenic and antiestrogenic EDCs were assessed by analyzing the calling behavior of short-term exposed male Xenopus laevis. The estrogenic 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), and the antiestrogenic EDCs tamoxifen (TAM) and fulvestrant (ICI) were used as model substances. As previously demonstrated, sole EE2 exposure (10-10 M) resulted in significant alterations of the male calling behavior, including altered temporal and spectral parameters of the advertisement calls. Sole TAM (10-7 M, 10-8 M, 10-10 M) or ICI (10-7 M) exposure, on the other hand, did not affect any of the measured parameters. If frogs were co-exposed to EE2 (10-10 M) and TAM (10-7 M) the effects of EE2 on some parameters were abolished, but co-exposure to EE2 and ICI (10-7 M) neutralized all estrogenic effects. Thus, although EDCs with antiestrogenic MOA might not exhibit any effects per se, they can alter the estrogenic effects of EE2. Our observations demonstrate that there is need to further investigate the combined effects of EDCs with various, not only opposing, MOAs as this would reflect realistic wildlife situations.",PMC3445530

In this study, we show that atrazine rapidly increases cAMP levels in cultured rat pituitary and testicular Leydig cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but less effectively than 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a competitive non-specific inhibitor of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). In forskolin (an activator of adenylyl cyclase)- and probenecid (an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide transporters)-treated cells, but not in 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine-treated cells, atrazine further increased cAMP levels, indicating that inhibition of PDEs accounts for accumulation of cAMP. In contrast to cAMP, atrazine did not alter cGMP levels, further indicating that it inhibits cAMP-specific PDEs. Atrazine-induced changes in cAMP levels were sufficient to stimulate prolactin release in pituitary cells and androgen production in Leydig cells, indicating that it acts as an endocrine disrupter both in cells that secrete by exocytosis of prestored hormones and in cells that secrete by de novo hormone synthesis. Rolipram abolished the stimulatory effect of atrazine on cAMP release in both cell types, suggesting that it acts as an inhibitor of PDE4s, isoforms whose mRNA transcripts dominate in pituitary and Leydig cells together with mRNA for PDE8A. In contrast, immortalized lacto-somatotrophs showed low expression of these mRNA transcripts and several fold higher cAMP levels compared to normal pituitary cells, and atrazine was unable to further increase cAMP levels. These results indicate that atrazine acts as a general endocrine disrupter by inhibiting cAMP-specific PDE4s.",PMC4181665

Their intended mechanism is prolonged sodium channel opening, but recent studies reveal that pyrethroids such as permethrin and bifenthrin also have endocrine activity. Additionally, metabolites may have greater endocrine activity than parent compounds. The authors evaluated the in vivo concentration-dependent ability of bifenthrin and permethrin to induce choriogenin (an estrogen-responsive protein) in Menidia beryllina, a fish species known to reside in pyrethroid-contaminated aquatic habitats. The authors then compared the in vivo response with an in vitro assay--chemical activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX). Juvenile M. beryllina exposed to bifenthrin (1, 10, 100 ng/L), permethrin (0.1, 1, 10 µg/L), and ethinylestradiol (1, 10, 50 ng/L) had significantly higher ng/mL choriogenin (Chg) measured in whole body homogenate than controls. Though Chg expression in fish exposed to ethinylestradiol (EE2) exhibited a traditional sigmoidal concentration response, curves fit to Chg expressed in fish exposed to pyrethroids suggest a unimodal response, decreasing slightly as concentration increases. Whereas the in vivo response indicated that bifenthrin and permethrin or their metabolites act as estrogen agonists, the CALUX assay demonstrated estrogen antagonism by the pyrethroids. The results, supported by evidence from previous studies, suggest that bifenthrin and permethrin, or their metabolites, appear to act as estrogen receptor (ER) agonists in vivo, and that the unmetabolized pyrethroids, particularly bifenthrin, act as an ER antagonists in cultured mammalian cells.",PMC3529915

Aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) interacting protein (AIP) loss of function mutations cause somatotrope and lactotrope adenomas in humans. AIP sequesters AhR and inhibits its transcriptional function. Because of the link between AIP and pituitary tumors, we hypothesize that exposure to dioxins, potent exogenous ligands for AhR that are persistent in the environment, may predispose to pituitary dysfunction through activation of AhR. In the present study, we examined the effect of AhR activation on proliferation and endogenous pituitary hormone expression in the GH3 rat somatolactotrope tumor cell line and the effect of loss of AhR action in knockout mice. GH3 cells respond to nM doses of the reversible AhR agonist β-naphthoflavone with a robust induction of Cyp1a1. Although mRNA levels of the anti-proliferative signaling cytokine TGFbeta1 are suppressed upon β-naphthoflavone treatment, we did not observe an alteration in cell proliferation. AhR activation with β-naphthoflavone suppresses Ahr expression and impairs expression of prolactin (PRL), but not growth hormone (GH) mRNA in GH3 cells. In mice, loss of Ahr similarly leads to a reduction in Prl mRNA at P3, while Gh is unaffected. Additionally, there is a significant reduction in pituitary hormones Lhb and Fshb in the absence of Ahr. Overall, these results demonstrate that AhR is important for pituitary hormone expression and suggest that environmental dioxins can exert endocrine disrupting effects at the pituitary.",PMC3489979

In the present study, we show the dose-dependent effects of MEHP on adipocyte differentiation and GPDH (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) activity in the murine 3T3-L1 cell model. MEHP induced the expression of PPARγ as well as its target genes required for adipogenesis in vitro. Moreover, MEHP perturbed key regulators of adipogenesis and lipogenic pathway in vivo. In utero exposure to a low dose of MEHP significantly increased b.w. (body weight) and fat pad weight in male offspring at PND (postnatal day) 60. In addition, serum cholesterol, TAG (triacylglycerol) and glucose levels were also significantly elevated. These results suggest that perinatal exposure to MEHP may be expected to increase the incidence of obesity in a sex-dependent manner and can act as a potential chemical stressor for obesity and obesity-related disorders.",PMC3497724

Four strains LHM1, LHM2, LHM3 and LHM4, not previously reported as DEHP-degraders, were identified via 16S rRNA gene sequence. Gram-positive strains LHM1 and LHM2 had a greater than 97% similarity with Chryseomicrobium imtechense MW 10(T) and Lysinibacillus fusiformis NBRC 15717(T), respectively.

Phylogenetic analysis also corroborated these similarities of strains LHM1 and LHM2 to the corresponding bacteria species. Strains LHM2 and LHM4 grew faster than strains LHM1 and LHM3 in the enrichment where DEHP was the sole carbon source.

The widespread exposure of individuals to BPA is suspected to affect a variety of physiological functions, including reproduction, development, and metabolism. Here we report that the mechanisms by which BPA and two congeners, bisphenol AF and bisphenol C (BPC), bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ER) α and β differ from that used by 17β-estradiol. We show that bisphenols act as partial agonists of ERs by activating the N-terminal activation function 1 regardless of their effect on the C-terminal activation function 2, which ranges from weak agonism (with BPA) to antagonism (with BPC). Crystallographic analysis of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs reveals two discrete binding modes, reflecting the different activities of compounds on ERs. BPA and 17β-estradiol bind to ERs in a similar fashion, whereas, with a phenol ring pointing toward the activation helix H12, the orientation of BPC accounts for the marked antagonist character of this compound. Based on structural data, we developed a protocol for in silico evaluation of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs or other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, such as estrogen-related receptor γ and androgen receptor, which are two known main targets of bisphenols. Overall, this study provides a wealth of tools and information that could be used for the development of BPA substitutes devoid of nuclear hormone receptor-mediated activity and more generally for environmental risk assessment.",PMC3443136

Developmental effects of 17α-ethynylestradiol on the mangrove rivulus' ovotestis.,2012,"Interest in the occurrence and fate of trace organic contaminants in the aquatic environment and their potential effects on all organisms has increased over the past two decades. Researches on contaminants have included both natural and synthetic estrogenic contaminants, neuroactive pharmaceuticals, and other endocrine disrupting chemicals that are mediated by the androgen and progesterone receptors. Exposure to very low concentrations (ng/L or parts per trillion) of compounds such as 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE(2)), a synthetic estrogen, can affect gonadal development, viability and production of eggs, fertilization rate, and sexual differentiation in fishes. Researchers and aquaculturists have used exposures to relatively higher concentrations of androgens and estrogens, for example 17α-methyltestosterone and EE(2), respectively, to direct sexual differentiation in a number of fishes. Rivulus is an androdioecious teleost that in nature exists mostly as selfing, simultaneous hermaphrodites as well as a small number of males that outcross with hermaphrodites. No one has either collected females in the wild or created functional females in the laboratory. This study had two goals: (1) to develop a reliable protocol to produce female rivulus to enable downstream technologies such as embryo injections and (2) to investigate developmental effects of EE(2) on the sexual outcome, reproductive health, and relevant gene expression in rivulus. With these goals in mind, we exposed newly hatched rivulus to nominal concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 parts per million (ppm) EE(2) for 4 weeks, grew them to maturity in control water, and then compared egg production; production and viability of embryos; age of reproductive maturity; and gene expression in the brain, gonad, and liver. Expression levels of seven genes with known relevance to gonadal development and function (cyp19a1b, cyp19a1a, dmrt1, figα, ERα, ERβ, and vtg) were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There was a significant decrease in cyp19a1a gene expression in the brain, corresponding to increased exposure to EE(2). Gonadal gene expression for cyp19a1a, ERα, and dmrt1 also decreased in response to EE(2). Vtg expression in the liver was unaffected. Our hypothesis that exposure to EE(2) during gonadal differentiation would direct female development was not supported by the data. However, treated fish exhibited impaired reproductive health that included reduced expression of relevant genes and, importantly, decreased fertility, increased sterility, and delay of age of reproductive maturity. The results of this study suggest that the development and maintenance of a simultaneous hermphrodite ovotestis may be particularly sensitive to its hormonal milieu.",PMC3501100

We hypothesized that the consistent lifestyle of an Old Order Mennonite (OOM) community would provide an ideal setting in which to characterize sources of exposure to BPA and phthalates. We obtained urine samples from ten mid-term pregnant OOM women (ages-21-39) to determine concentrations of 9 phthalate metabolites and BPA and collected a self-reported survey of participants' household environment, product use, and lifestyle within a 48-h period prior to urine collection. We compared their metabolite concentrations to pregnant women included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2007-2008).

It is present in a variety of products used daily including food containers, paper, and dental sealants and is now widely detected in human urine and blood. Exposure to BPA during development may affect brain organization and behavior, perhaps as a consequence of its actions as a steroid hormone agonist/antagonist and/or an epigenetic modifier. Here we show that BPA produces transgenerational alterations in genes and behavior. Female mice received phytoestrogen-free chow with or without BPA before mating and throughout gestation. Plasma levels of BPA in supplemented dams were in a range similar to those measured in humans. Juveniles in the first generation exposed to BPA in utero displayed fewer social interactions as compared with control mice, whereas in later generations (F(2) and F(4)), the effect of BPA was to increase these social interactions. Brains from embryos (embryonic d 18.5) exposed to BPA had lower gene transcript levels for several estrogen receptors, oxytocin, and vasopressin as compared with controls; decreased vasopressin mRNA persisted into the F(4) generation, at which time oxytocin was also reduced but only in males. Thus, exposure to a low dose of BPA, only during gestation, has immediate and long-lasting, transgenerational effects on mRNA in brain and social behaviors.

Greater than 20% of regulated effluents discharged into U.S. surface waters experience in-stream dilution of <10-fold and potential impacts are particularly likely in receiving waters dominated by POTW effluents. The increasing use of biosolids on agricultural land exerts additional stress, thereby necessitating environmental monitoring for potential ecological and human health effects. Alternatively or in addition to monitoring efforts, screening for potentially hazardous chemicals can be performed using empirical models that are scalable and can deliver results rapidly. The present study makes use of data from U.S. EPA's Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey (TNSSS) to predict the aqueous-phase concentrations and removal efficiencies of 10 sterols (campesterol, β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, β-stigmastanol, cholesterol, desmosterol, cholestanol, coprostanol, epicoprostanol, and ergosterol) as well as the putative toxicity posed by four specific hormones based on their reported biosolids concentrations using published empirical models. Model predictions indicate that removal efficiencies for sterols are uniformly high (~99%) and closely match removal rates calculated from chemical monitoring at POTWs (paired t-test; p=0.01). Results from toxicity modeling indicate that the hormones estrone, estradiol and estriol had the highest leaching potentials amongst the compounds considered here and that 17 β-ethinylestradiol was found to pose a potentially significant threat to fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) via run-off or leaching from biosolids-amended fields. This study exemplifies the use of in silico analysis to (i) identify potentially problematic organic compounds in biosolids, (ii) predict influent and effluent levels for hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) of emerging concern, and (iii) provide initial estimates of runoff concentrations, in this case for four prominent hormones known to act as endocrine disruptors.",PMC3496017

We examined the effect of di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) on the metabolic profile of cardiomyocytes because alterations in metabolic processes can lead to cell dysfunction. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with DEHP at a concentration and duration comparable to clinical exposure (50-100 μg/mL, 72 hr). We assessed the effect of DEHP on gene expression using microarray analysis. Physiological responses were examined via fatty acid utilization, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial mass, and Western blot analysis. Exposure to DEHP led to up-regulation of genes associated with fatty acid transport, esterification, mitochondrial import, and β-oxidation. The functional outcome was an increase in myocyte fatty acid-substrate utilization, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial mass, PPARα (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α) protein expression, and extracellular acidosis. Treatment with a PPARα agonist (Wy-14643) only partially mimicked the effects observed in DEHP-treated cells. Data suggest that DEHP exposure results in metabolic remodeling of cardiomyocytes, whereby cardiac cells increase their dependence on fatty acids for energy production. This fuel switch may be regulated at both the gene expression and posttranscription levels. Our findings have important clinical implications because chronic dependence on fatty acids is associated with an accumulation in lipid intermediates, lactate, protons, and reactive oxygen species. This dependence can sensitize the heart to ischemic injury and ventricular dysfunction.",PMC3440133

We and others have shown that DDT activates cell-signaling cascades, culminating in the activation of estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent gene expression. Here, we identify a mechanism by which DDT alters cellular signaling and gene expression, independent of the estrogen receptor. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction array analysis of gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using either estradiol (E₂) or o,p´-DDT to identify distinct cellular gene expression responses. To elucidate the mechanisms by which DDT regulates cell signaling, we used molecular and pharmacological techniques. E₂ and DDT treatment both altered the expression of many of the genes assayed, but up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was observed only after DDT treatment, and this increase was not affected by the pure estrogen receptor α antagonist ICI 182780. Furthermore, DDT increased activation of the HIF-1 response element (HRE), a known enhancer of the VEGFA gene. This DDT-mediated increase in HRE activity was augmented by the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein) and was dependent on the p38 pathway. DDT up-regulated the expression of several genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were not altered by treatment with E₂, including VEGFA. We propose that this DDT-initiated, ER-independent stimulation of gene expression is due to DDT's ability to initiate crosstalk between MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways and transcriptional coactivators.",PMC3440107

Our approach to developing toxic equivalency models produced relative potencies similar to the toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Pregnant rhesus monkeys were fed 400 μg of BPA per kg of body weight daily from gestational day 100 to term, which resulted in 0.68 ± 0.312 ng of unconjugated BPA per mL of maternal serum, a level comparable to that found in humans. At birth, the mammary glands of female offspring were removed for morphological analysis. Morphological parameters similar to those shown to be affected in rodents exposed prenatally to BPA were measured in whole-mounted glands; estrogen receptor (ER) α and β expression were assessed in paraffin sections. Student's t tests for equality of means were used to assess differences between exposed and unexposed groups. The density of mammary buds was significantly increased in BPA-exposed monkeys, and the overall development of their mammary gland was more advanced compared with unexposed monkeys. No significant differences were observed in ER expression. Altogether, gestational exposure to the estrogen-mimic BPA altered the developing mammary glands of female nonhuman primates in a comparable manner to that observed in rodents.",PMC3361442

We previously demonstrated that ER induction of the chemokine CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor-1) is required for estradiol (E2)-stimulated proliferation of human ovarian carcinoma cells. In the current study, we report that known ""endocrine disrupting chemicals"" (EDCs) display mitogenic activities in ovarian cancer cells via their ability to activate the ER and upregulate CXCL12 expression. Notably, the EDCs genistein, bisphenol A and HPTE stimulated both cell proliferation and induction of CXCL12 mRNA and protein in a manner comparable to estradiol. The effects were completely attenuated by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780, revealing that observed activities of these agents were receptor-mediated. In cell proliferation assays, the mitogenic effects of estradiol and EDCs were obviated by siRNAs targeting CXCL12 and restored upon addition of exogenous CXCL12. Furthermore, an inhibitor to the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4 completely attenuated growth-stimulatory effects of E2 and EDCs. These studies highlight a potential role of EDCs possessing estrogenic activities in the etiology of ovarian cancer. Moreover, they suggest that the ER-CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis may represent a promising target for development of therapeutics for ER+ ovarian cancers.",PMC4287997

Between-participant variations in sampling conditions of these biological samples constitute a potential source of exposure misclassification. Few studies attempted to correct biomarker levels for this error. We aimed to assess the influence of sampling conditions on concentrations of urinary biomarkers of select phenols and phthalates, two widely-produced families of chemicals, and to standardize biomarker concentrations on sampling conditions. Urine samples were collected between 2002 and 2006 among 287 pregnant women from Eden and Pélagie cohorts, from which phthalates and phenols metabolites levels were assayed. We applied a 2-step standardization method based on regression residuals. First, the influence of sampling conditions (including sampling hour, duration of storage before freezing) and of creatinine levels on biomarker concentrations were characterized using adjusted linear regression models. In the second step, the model estimates were used to remove the variability in biomarker concentrations due to sampling conditions and to standardize concentrations as if all samples had been collected under the same conditions (e.g., same hour of urine collection). Sampling hour was associated with concentrations of several exposure biomarkers. After standardization for sampling conditions, median concentrations differed by--38% for 2,5-dichlorophenol to +80 % for a metabolite of diisodecyl phthalate. However, at the individual level, standardized biomarker levels were strongly correlated (correlation coefficients above 0.80) with unstandardized measures. Sampling conditions, such as sampling hour, should be systematically collected in biomarker-based studies, in particular when the biomarker half-life is short. The 2-step standardization method based on regression residuals that we proposed in order to limit the impact of heterogeneity in sampling conditions could be further tested in studies describing levels of biomarkers or their influence on health.",PMC3533777

Male rats exposed in utero to certain phthalate plasticizers exhibit multinucleated germ cell (MNG) induction and suppressed steroidogenic gene expression and testosterone production in the fetal testis, causing TDS-consistent effects of hypospadias and cryptorchidism. Mice exposed to phthalates in utero exhibit MNG induction only. This disparity in response demonstrates a species-specific sensitivity to phthalate-induced suppression of fetal Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Importantly, ex vivo phthalate exposure of the fetal testis does not recapitulate the species-specific endocrine disruption, demonstrating the need for a new bioassay to assess the human response to phthalates. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a rat and mouse testis xenograft bioassay of phthalate exposure and examine the human fetal testis response. Fetal rat, mouse, and human testes were xenografted into immunodeficient rodent hosts, and hosts were gavaged with a range of phthalate doses over multiple days. Xenografts were harvested and assessed for histopathology and steroidogenic end points. Consistent with the in utero response, phthalate exposure induced MNG formation in rat and mouse xenografts, but only rats exhibited suppressed steroidogenesis. Across a range of doses, human fetal testis xenografts exhibited MNG induction but were resistant to suppression of steroidogenic gene expression.

It has been speculated that these compounds may also perturb epigenetic mechanisms and thus contribute to the early origin of adult onset disease. We hypothesised that histone methylation may be a component of the epigenome that is susceptible to perturbation. We used coexpression analysis of publicly available data to investigate the combinatorial actions of nuclear receptors and genes involved in histone methylation in normal testis and when faced with endocrine disruptor compounds. The expression patterns of a set of genes were profiled across testis tissue in human, rat and mouse, plus control and exposed samples from four toxicity experiments in the rat. Our results indicate that histone methylation events are a more general component of nuclear receptor mediated transcriptional regulation in the testis than previously appreciated. Coexpression patterns support the role of a gatekeeper mechanism involving the histone methylation modifiers Kdm1, Prdm2, and Ehmt1 and indicate that this mechanism is a common determinant of transcriptional integrity for genes critical to diverse physiological endpoints relevant to endocrine disruption. Coexpression patterns following exposure to vinclozolin and dibutyl phthalate suggest that coactivity of the demethylase Kdm1 in particular warrants further investigation in relation to endocrine disruptor mode of action. This study provides proof of concept that a bioinformatics approach that profiles genes related to a specific hypothesis across multiple biological settings can provide powerful insight into coregulatory activity that would be difficult to discern at an individual experiment level or by traditional differential expression analysis methods.",PMC3319570

Although estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds are assumed to contribute to the worldwide decline of amphibian populations by adverse effects on sexual differentiation, evidence for EE2 affecting amphibian mating behaviour is lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that EE2 exposure at five different concentrations (0.296 ng/L, 2.96 ng/L, 29.64 ng/L, 2.96 µg/L and 296.4 µg/L) can disrupt the mating behavior of adult male Xenopus laevis. EE2 exposure at all concentrations lowered male sexual arousal, indicated by decreased proportions of advertisement calls and increased proportions of the call type rasping, which characterizes a sexually unaroused state of a male. Additionally, EE2 at all tested concentrations affected temporal and spectral parameters of the advertisement calls, respectively. The classical and highly sensitive biomarker vitellogenin, on the other hand, was only induced at concentrations equal or higher than 2.96 µg/L. If kept under control conditions after a 96 h EE2 exposure (2.96 µg/L), alterations of male advertisement calls vanish gradually within 6 weeks and result in a lower sexual attractiveness of EE2 exposed males toward females as demonstrated by female choice experiments. These findings indicate that exposure to environmentally relevant EE2 concentrations can directly disrupt male mate calling behavior of X. laevis and can indirectly affect the mating behavior of females. The results suggest the possibility that EE2 exposure could reduce the reproductive success of EE2 exposed animals and these effects might contribute to the global problem of amphibian decline.",PMC3280221

In males, exposure to PCBs and PBDEs at 1.7, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 μmol/kg/day induced equivalent and dose-dependent reductions in T4 from p 7 to p 21.

Early-life feeding regimes, categorised as primarily breast, early formula, early soy and late soy, were defined using infant-feeding questionnaires administered during infancy. For this analysis, age at menarche was assessed using questionnaires administered approximately annually between ages 8 and 14.5. Eligible subjects were limited to term, singleton, White females. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models to assess age at menarche and risk of menarche over the study period. The present analysis included 2920 girls. Approximately 2% of mothers reported that soy products were introduced into the infant diet at or before 4 months of age (early soy). The median age at menarche [interquartile range (IQR)] in the study sample was 153 months [144-163], approximately 12.8 years. The median age at menarche among early soy-fed girls was 149 months (12.4 years) [IQR, 140-159].

Our results also suggest that girls fed soy products in early infancy may have an increased risk of menarche specifically in early adolescence. These findings may be the observable manifestation of mild endocrine-disrupting effects of soy isoflavone exposure.

Environmental pollutants, notably endocrine disrupting compounds, can interfere with the proper functioning of hormones, thereby impacting the expression of hormonally regulated traits. Atrazine, one of the most widely used herbicides, can alter sex hormone levels in exposed animals. I tested the effects of environmentally relevant atrazine exposures on mating signals and behaviors in male guppies, a sexually dimorphic freshwater fish. Prolonged atrazine exposure reduced the expression of two honest signals: the area of orange spots (ornaments) and the number of courtship displays performed. Atrazine exposure also reduced aggression towards competing males in the context of mate competition. In the wild, exposure levels vary among individuals because of differential distribution of the pollutants across habitats; hence, differently impacted males often compete for the same mates. Disrupted mating signals can reduce reproductive success as females avoid mating with perceptibly suboptimal males. Less aggressive males are at a competitive disadvantage and lose access to females. This study highlights the effects of atrazine on ecologically relevant mating signals and behaviors in exposed wildlife. Altered reproductive traits have important implications for population dynamics, evolutionary patterns, and conservation of wildlife species.",PMC3270011

In the present study, the roles of estrogen receptors (ER) in mediating the rapid contractile and arrhythmogenic effects of estrogens were examined. Contractility was used as an index to assess the impact of E(2) or BPA on Ca(2+) handling in rodent ventricular myocytes. The concentration-response curve for the stimulatory effects of BPA and E(2) on female myocyte was inverted-U shaped. Detectable effects for each compound were observed at 10(-12) M, and the most efficacious concentrations for each were at 10(-9) M. Sensitivity to E(2) and BPA was not observed in male myocytes and was abolished in myocytes from ovariectomized females. Analysis using protein-conjugated E(2) suggests that these rapid actions are induced by membrane-associated receptors. Analysis using selective ER agonists and antagonists and a genetic ERβ knockout mouse model showed that ERα and ERβ have opposing actions in myocytes and that the balance between ERβ and ERα signaling is the prime regulator of the sex-specific sensitivity toward estrogens. The response of female myocytes to E(2) and BPA is dominated by the stimulatory ERβ-mediated signaling, and the absence of BPA and E(2) responsiveness in males is due to a counterbalancing-suppressive action of ERα. We conclude that the sex-specific sensitivity of myocytes to estrogens and the rapid arrhythmogenic effects of BPA and estradiol in the female heart are regulated by the balance between ERα and ERβ signaling.",PMC3275382

Altered programming can result in numerous adverse consequences in estrogen-target tissues, some of which may not be apparent until later in life. For example, a wide variety of structural, functional, and cellular effects have been identified in reproductive tract tissues. In addition to well-documented reproductive changes, obesity and diabetes have joined the list of adverse effects that have been associated with developmental exposure to environmental estrogens and other endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Obesity is a significant public health problem reaching epidemic proportions worldwide. Experimental animal studies document an association of developmental exposure to environmental estrogens and obesity. For example, a murine model of perinatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol has proven useful in studying mechanisms involved in abnormal programming of differentiating estrogen-target tissues, including reproductive tract tissues and adipocytes. Other environmental estrogens, including the environmental contaminant bisphenol A, have also been linked to reproductive problems and obesity later in life. Epidemiology studies support similar findings in humans, as do studies of cells in culture. Together, these findings suggest new targets for abnormal programming by estrogenic chemicals and provide evidence supporting the scientific concept termed the developmental origins of adult disease. Furthermore, the association of environmental estrogens with obesity and diabetes expands the focus on these diseases from intervention or treatment to include prevention or avoidance of chemical modifiers, especially during critical windows of development.",PMC3364077

At the end-point of exposure, the DMP-treated eggs and sperm were collected for analysis of their ultra-structures, ATPase activities and total lipid levels, and the fertilized gametes (embryos) were collected to monitor related reproductive parameters (fertilization rate, abnormal development rate and hatching success rate). Treatment with DMP did not significantly alter the structure or total lipid content of eggs at any of the doses tested. Hatching failures and morphological abnormalities were only observed with the highest dose of DMP (100 ppb). However, DMP exposure did suppress sperm ATPase activities and affect the morphological character of their mitochondria. DMP-treated sperm exhibited dose-dependent decreases in fertilization efficiency, morphogenesis and hatchability. Relatively obvious toxicological effects were observed when both sperm and eggs were exposed to DMP. Furthermore, RT-PCR results indicate that treatment of gametes with DMP changed the expression patterns of physiologically-regulated genes (cyp3a, 17β-HSD-11 and 17β-HSD-12) in subsequent embryogenesis. Taken together, this study proofed that pre-fertilization exposure of abalone eggs, sperm or both to DMP adversely affects the fertilization process and subsequent embryogenesis.",PMC3197592

We explored whether prenatal organochlorine compound (OC) concentrations [polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)] were associated with overweight at 6.5 years of age and whether child sex or fat intakes modified these associations. We studied 344 children from a Spanish birth cohort established in 1997-1998. Overweight at 6.5 years was defined as a body mass index (BMI) z-score ≥ 85th percentile of the World Health Organization reference. Cord blood OC concentrations were measured and treated as categorical variables (tertiles). Children's diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaire. Relative risks (RRs) were estimated using generalized linear models. After multivariable adjustment, we found an increased RR of overweight in the third tertile of PCB exposure [RR = 1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09, 2.64] and the second tertile of DDE exposure (RR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.55), but no association with DDT exposure in the population overall. Associations between overweight and PCB and DDE concentrations were strongest in girls (p-interaction between 0.01 and 0.28); DDT was associated with overweight only in boys. For DDT we observed stronger associations in children with fat intakes at or above compared with below the median, but this interaction was not significant (p-interaction > 0.05). This study suggests that prenatal OC exposures may be associated with overweight in children and that sex and high-fat intake may influence susceptibility.",PMC3295349

The current study addressed whether perinatal exposure to endocrine disruptors re-programs expression of a suite of genes expressed in the hypothalamus that control reproductive function and related these molecular changes to premature reproductive aging. Fischer rats were exposed daily for 12 consecutive days to vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide), estradiol benzoate (EB) (1 mg/kg), and MXC (low dose, 20 μg/kg or high dose, 100 mg/kg), beginning on embryonic d 19 through postnatal d 7. The perinatally exposed females were aged to 16-17 months and monitored for reproductive senescence. After euthanasia, hypothalamic regions [preoptic area (POA) and medial basal hypothalamus] were dissected for real-time PCR of gene expression or pyrosequencing to assess DNA methylation of the Esr1 gene. Using a 48-gene PCR platform, two genes (Kiss1 and Esr1) were significantly different in the POA of endocrine-disrupting chemical-exposed rats compared with vehicle-exposed rats after Bonferroni correction. Fifteen POA genes were up-regulated by at least 50% in EB or high-dose MXC compared with vehicle. To understand the epigenetic basis of the increased Esr1 gene expression, we performed bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing of the Esr1 promoter. EB-treated rats had significantly higher percentage of methylation at three CpG sites in the Esr1 promoter compared with control rats. Together with these molecular effects, perinatal MXC and EB altered estrous cyclicity and advanced reproductive senescence. Thus, early life exposure to endocrine disruptors has lifelong effects on neuroendocrine gene expression and DNA methylation, together with causing the advancement of reproductive senescence.",PMC3231835

Within the framework of the EU (European Union) ENRIECO (ENvironmental Health RIsks in European Birth Cohorts) and EU OBELIX (OBesogenic Endocrine disrupting chemicals: LInking prenatal eXposure to the development of obesity later in life) projects, we examined the hypothesis that the combination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) adversely affects birth weight. We used maternal and cord blood and breast milk samples of 7,990 women enrolled in 15 study populations from 12 European birth cohorts from 1990 through 2008. Using identical variable definitions, we performed for each cohort linear regression of birth weight on estimates of cord serum concentration of PCB-153 and p,p´-DDE adjusted for gestational age and a priori selected covariates. We obtained summary estimates by meta-analysis and performed analyses of interactions. The median concentration of cord serum PCB-153 was 140 ng/L (range of cohort medians 20-484 ng/L) and that of p,p´-DDE was 528 ng/L (range of cohort medians 50-1,208 ng/L). Birth weight decreased with increasing cord serum concentration of PCB-153 after adjustment for potential confounders in 12 of 15 study populations. The meta-analysis including all cohorts indicated a birth weight decline of 150 g [95% confidence interval (CI): -250, -50 g] per 1-µg/L increase in PCB-153, an exposure contrast that is close to the range of exposures across the cohorts. A 1-µg/L increase in p,p´-DDE was associated with a 7-g decrease in birth weight (95% CI: -18, 4 g). The findings suggest that low-level exposure to PCB (or correlated exposures) impairs fetal growth, but that exposure to p,p´-DDE does not. The study adds to mounting evidence that low-level exposure to PCBs is inversely associated with fetal growth.",PMC3279442

Higher urine BPA concentrations have been shown to be associated with cardiovascular diseases in humans. However, neither the nature nor the mechanism(s) of BPA action on the heart are understood. The rapid (<7 min) effects of BPA and 17β-estradiol (E2) in the heart and ventricular myocytes from rodents were investigated in the present study. In isolated ventricular myocytes from young adult females, but not males, physiological concentrations of BPA or E2 (10⁻⁹ M) rapidly induced arrhythmogenic triggered activities. The effects of BPA were particularly pronounced when combined with estradiol. Under conditions of catecholamine stimulation, E2 and BPA promoted ventricular arrhythmias in female, but not male, hearts. The cellular mechanism of the female-specific pro-arrhythmic effects of BPA and E2 were investigated. Exposure to E2 and/or BPA rapidly altered myocyte Ca²⁺ handling; in particular, estrogens markedly increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca²⁺ leak, and increased SR Ca²⁺ load. Ryanodine (10⁻⁷ M) inhibition of SR Ca²⁺ leak suppressed estrogen-induced triggered activities. The rapid response of female myocytes to estrogens was abolished in an estrogen receptor (ER) β knockout mouse model. Physiologically-relevant concentrations of BPA and E2 promote arrhythmias in a female-specific manner in rat hearts; the pro-arrhythmic actions of estrogens are mediated by ERβ-signaling through alterations of myocyte Ca²⁺ handling, particularly increases in SR Ca²⁺ leak. Our study provides the first experimental evidence suggesting that exposure to estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals and the unique sensitivity of female hearts to estrogens may play a role in arrhythmogenesis in the female heart.",PMC3181279

In a previous study, we demonstrated that diethylstilbestrol (DES), a non-steroidal estrogen, induces fish oocyte maturation via the membrane progestin receptor (mPR). Here, we attempted to evaluate the effect of DES as an environmental endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) upon fish oocyte maturation using live zebrafish. DES triggered oocyte maturation within several hours in vivo when administrated directly into the surrounding water. The natural teleost maturation-inducing hormone, 17alpha, 20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20beta-DHP) also induced oocyte maturation in vivo. Steroids such as testosterone, progesterone or 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were also effective in vivo. Further studies indicated that externally applied 17,20beta-DHP even induced ovulation. In contrast to 17,20beta -DHP, DES induced maturation but not ovulation. Theoretically this assay system provides a means to distinguish pathways involved in the induction of ovulation, which are known to be induced by genomic actions from the pathway normally involved in the induction of oocyte maturation, a typical non-genomic action-dependent pathway. In summary, we have demonstrated the effect of EDCs on fish oocyte maturation in vivo. To address the effects, we have explored a conceptually new approach to distinguish between the genomic and non-genomic actions induced by steroids. The assay can be applied to screens of progestin-like effects upon oocyte maturation and ovulation for small molecules of pharmacological agents or EDCs.",PMC3182199

Long-term effects of prenatal exposure to non-persistent pesticides on body composition have so far not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to assess possible effects of prenatal exposure to currently used pesticides on children's growth, endocrine and reproductive function. In a prospective study of 247 children born by women working in greenhouses in early pregnancy, 168 were categorized as prenatally exposed to pesticides. At three months (n = 203) and at 6 to 11 years of age (n = 177) the children underwent a clinical examination and blood sampling for analysis of IGF-I, IGFBP3 and thyroid hormones. Body fat percentage at age 6 to 11 years was calculated from skin fold measurements. Pesticide related associations were tested by linear multiple regression analysis, adjusting for relevant confounders. Compared to unexposed children birth weight and weight for gestational age were lower in the highly exposed children: -173 g (-322; -23), -4.8% (-9.0; -0.7) and medium exposed children: -139 g (-272; -6), -3.6% (-7.2; -0.0). Exposed (medium and highly together) children had significantly larger increase in BMI Z-score (0.55 SD (95% CI: 0.1; 1.0) from birth to school age) and highly exposed children had 15.8% (0.2; 34.6) larger skin folds and higher body fat percentage compared to unexposed. If prenatally exposed to both pesticides and maternal smoking (any amount), the sum of four skin folds was 46.9% (95% CI: 8.1; 99.5) and body fat percentage 29.1% (95% CI: 3.0; 61.4) higher. There were subtle associations between exposure and TSH Z-score -0.66(-1.287; -0.022) and IGF-I Z-score (girls: -0.62(-1.0; -0.22), boys: 0.38(-0.03; 0.79)), but not IGFBP3. Occupational exposure to currently used pesticides may have adverse effects in spite of the added protection offered to pregnant women. Maternal exposure to combinations of modern, non-persistent pesticides during early pregnancy was associated with affected growth, both prenatally and postnatally. We found a biphasic association with lower weight at birth followed by increased body fat accumulation from birth to school age. We cannot rule out some residual confounding due to differences in social class, although this was adjusted for. Associations were stronger in highly exposed than in medium exposed children, and effects on body fat content at school age was potentiated by maternal smoking in pregnancy.",PMC3196902

Studies were conducted to document biomarker responses both temporally and spatially to better understand the influence of normal physiological cycles, as well as water quality and land-use influences. Smallmouth bass were collected over a 2-year period from three tributaries of the Potomac River: the Shenandoah River, the South Branch Potomac and Conococheague Creek, and an out-of-basin reference site on the Gauley River. The prevalence of TO varied seasonally with the lowest prevalence observed in July, post-spawn. Reproductive maturity and/or lack of spawning the previous spring, as well as land-use practices such as application of manure and pesticides, may influence the seasonal observations. Annual, seasonal, and site differences were also observed in the percentage of males with measurable concentrations of plasma vitellogenin, mean concentration of plasma vitellogenin in females, and plasma concentrations of 17β-estradiol and testosterone in both sexes. Bass collected in the South Branch Potomac (moderate to high prevalence of TO) had less sperm per testes mass with a lower percentage of those sperm being motile when compared to those from the Gauley River (low prevalence of TO). An inverse relationship was noted between TO severity and sperm motility.

The objective of the present study was to characterize the mobilization of selected endocrine-disrupting compounds, heavy metals, and total estrogenic activity in rainfall runoff from land-applied biosolids. Rainfall simulations were conducted on soil plots amended with biosolids. Surface runoff and leachate was collected and analyzed for the endocrine-disrupting compounds bisphenol A, 17α-ethynylestradiol, triclocarban, triclosan, octylphenol, and nonylphenol; a suite of 16 metals; and estrogenic activity via the estrogen receptor-mediated chemical activated luciferase gene expression (ER-CALUX) bioassay.

Triclosan, Ni, and Cu were detected at levels that might pose some risk to aquatic life, though levels of metals in the biosolids were well below the maximum allowable regulatory limits.

However, DES exposure in utero is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in adult women. Similarly, fetal exposure to BPA induces neoplastic changes in mammary tissue of mice. We hypothesized that epigenetic alterations would precede the increased risk of breast neoplasia after in utero exposure to endocrine disruptors. Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase that has been linked to breast cancer risk and epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis. We examined the effect of BPA and DES on EZH2 expression and function in MCF-7 cells and in mammary glands of mice exposed in utero. DES and BPA treatment approximated human exposure. EZH2 functional activity was assessed by measuring histone H3 trimethylation. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with DES or BPA led to a 3- and 2-fold increase in EZH2 mRNA expression, respectively (p < 0.05) as well as increased EZH2 protein expression. Mice exposed to DES in utero showed a >2-fold increase in EZH2 expression in adult mammary tissue compared with controls (p < 0.05).

The testis is an important target for PAHs, yet insufficient attention has been paid to their effects on steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. We hypothesized that long-term exposure to low concentrations of B[a]P might disrupt testosterone production in Leydig cells via an alteration of steroidogenic proteins. Oral exposure to B[a]P reduced serum and intratesticular fluid testosterone levels in rats. However, we did not observe serious testicular atrophy or azoospermia, although spermatogonial apoptosis was significantly increased. Compared with control cells, Leydig cells primed with B[a]P in vivo produced less testosterone in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or dibutyl cyclic adenosine monophosphate in vitro. Of note, the reduction of testosterone levels was accompanied by decreased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), as well as increased levels of cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc), in Leydig cells. The up-regulation of P450scc expression after exposure to B[a]P appears to be associated with a compensatory mechanism for producing the maximum amount of pregnenolone with the minimum amount of transported cholesterol by StAR; the down-regulation of 3β-HSD may occur because B[a]P can negatively target 3β-HSD, which is required for testosterone production. B[a]P exposure can decrease epididymal sperm quality, possibly by disturbing testosterone levels, and StAR may be a major steroidogenic protein that is targeted by B[a]P or other PAHs.",PMC3226498

The specific objectives of the current study were to determine (1) whether female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) experience alterations in endocrine function when exposed to sediments collected from agriculturally intense watersheds and (2) if these sediments display anti-estrogenic activity in an in vitro assay. In addition, sediment samples were analyzed for the presence of steroid hormones and pesticides associated with local agricultural practices. To accomplish this, sediments and water were collected from three sites within two agriculturally intense Nebraska watersheds (Bow Creek and the Elkhorn River). In 2009, minnows were exposed to sediment and/or water collected from the two Bow Creek sites (East Bow Creek and the Confluence) in the laboratory, while in 2010, minnows were exposed to sediment and/or water from East Bow Creek, the Confluence and the Elkhorn River. Following the 7-day exposure period, the hepatic mRNA expression of two-estrogen responsive genes, estrogen receptor α (ERα) and vitellogenin (Vtg) was determined. In 2009, females exposed to Confluence sediments, in the presence of laboratory water or Confluence water, experienced significant reductions in ERα expression relative to unexposed and Confluence water-exposed females. The defeminization of these females suggests the presence of a biologically available anti-estrogenic compound in sediments collected from this site. In 2010, sediments were assessed for anti-estrogenic activity on days 0 and 7 of the exposure period using a 4-h yeast estrogen screen. Lipophilic extracts (LEs) of day 0 sediments collected from the Confluence and the Elkhorn River induced significant reductions in the estrogenic reporter activity of treated yeast cultures suggesting the presence of a lipophilic anti-estrogenic compound in these extracts. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of a variety of steroid hormones, including those associated with the production of beef cattle (i.e. β-trenbolone, α-zearalanol and α-zearalenol), in sediments indicating that compounds utilized by local beef cattle operations are capable of entering nearby watersheds. Overall, the results of this study indicate that an environmentally relevant anti-estrogenic compound is present in sediments from agriculturally intense watersheds and that this compound is bioavailable to fish.

Expression of sexually selected traits that have evolved through intrasexual competition for mates and intersexual choice of mating partner are more dependent on developmental and physical condition of an animal than naturally selected traits and thus might be particularly vulnerable to disruption by developmental exposure to EDCs. We have used the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) as a model to test this hypothesis. Adult male-male competition for mates in this species is supported by enhanced spatial navigational and exploratory abilities, which enable males to search for prospective, widely dispersed females. Male deer mice exposed to BPA or ethinyl estradiol (EE) through maternal diet showed no changes in external phenotype, sensory development, or adult circulating concentrations of testosterone and corticosterone, but spatial learning abilities and exploratory behaviors were severely compromised compared with control males. Because these traits are not sexually selected in females, BPA exposure predictably had no effect, although EE-exposed females demonstrated enhanced spatial navigational abilities. Both BPA-exposed and control females preferred control males to BPA-exposed males. Our demonstration that developmental exposure to BPA compromises cognitive abilities and behaviors essential for males to reproduce successfully has broad implications for other species, including our own. Thus, sexually selected traits might provide useful biomarkers to assess risk of environmental contamination in animal and human populations.",PMC3136312

EDs have profound effects on development and fertility. Imprinted genes had been identified as susceptible loci to environmental insults by EDs because they are functionally haploid, and because the imprints undergo epigenetic resetting between generations. To screen for possible epigenetic perturbations caused by EDs at imprinted loci, we treated pregnant mice daily between 8.5 and 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) with di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), bisphenol A (BPA), vinclozolin (VZ), or control oil vehicle. After isolating RNA from the placenta, yolk sac, amnion, head, body, heart, liver, lung, stomach, and intestines of 13.5 dpc embryos we measured the allele-specific expression of 38 imprinted transcripts using multiplex single nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) assays. In this representative data set we identified only a small number of transcripts that exhibited a substantial relaxation of imprinted expression with statistical significance: Slc22a18 with 10% relaxation in the embryo after BPA treatment; Rtl1as with 11 and 16% relaxation in the lung and placenta, respectively after BPA treatment; and Rtl1 with 12% relaxation in the yolk sac after DEHP treatment. Additionally, the standard deviation of allele-specificity increased in various organs after ED treatment for several transcripts including Igf2r, Rasgrf1, Usp29, Slc38a4, and Xist.

Using this method, we examined the effects of several halogenated contaminants, including 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 99), several hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (OH-BDEs), tribromophenol, tetrabromobisphenol A, and triclosan, on DI activity. The Michaelis constants (K(M)) of rT3 and T4 deiodination were determined to be 3.2 ± 0.7 and 17.3 ± 2.3μM. The V(max) was 160 ± 5.8 and 2.8 ± 0.10 pmol/min.mg protein, respectively. All studied contaminants inhibited DI activity in a dose-response manner, with the exception of BDE 99 and two OH-BDEs. 5'-Hydroxy 2,2',4,4',5-pentabromodiphenyl ether was found to be the most potent inhibitor of DI activity, and phenolic structures containing iodine were generally more potent inhibitors of DI activity relative to brominated, chlorinated, and fluorinated analogues. This study suggests that some halogenated phenolics, including current use compounds such as plastic monomers, flame retardants, and their metabolites, may disrupt TH homeostasis through the inhibition of DI activity in vivo.",PMC3216408

This process may be disrupted by estrogenic endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) resulting in altered sex behavior and the capacity to attract a mate in adulthood. To better understand the relative role each estrogen receptor (ER) subtype (ERα and ERβ) plays in mediating these effects, we exposed male Long Evans rats to estradiol benzoate (EB, 10 μg), vehicle, or agonists specific for ERβ (DPN, 1 mg/kg) or ERα (PPT, 1 mg/kg) daily for the first four days of life, and then assessed adult male reproductive behavior and attractiveness via a partner preference paradigm. DPN had a greater adverse impact than PPT on reproductive behavior, suggesting a functional role for ERβ in the organization of these male-specific behaviors. Therefore the impact of neonatal ERβ agonism was further investigated by repeating the experiment using vehicle, EB and additional DPN doses (0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, and 2 mg/kg bw). Exposure to DPN suppressed male reproductive behavior and attractiveness in a dose dependent manner. Finally, males were exposed to EB or an environmentally relevant dose of genistein (GEN, 10 mg/kg), a naturally occurring xenoestrogen, which has a higher relative binding affinity for ERβ than ERα. Sexual performance was impaired by GEN but not attractiveness. In addition to suppressing reproductive behavior and attractiveness, EB exposure significantly lowered the testis to body weight ratio, and circulating testosterone levels. DPN and GEN exposure only impaired behavior, suggesting that disrupted androgen secretion does not underlie the impairment.",PMC3126896

The TH-regulating deiodinases have been implicated in these impacts; however, PBDE effects on the fish thyroid system are largely unknown. Moreover, the liver as a potential target of PBDE toxicity has not been explored in young fish. This study measured decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) effects on TH regulation by measuring deiodinase activity in juvenile fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Dietary accumulations and debromination of BDE-209 were also measured, and the morphology of thyroid and liver tissues was examined. Juvenile fathead minnows (28 days old) received a 28-day dietary treatment of BDE-209 at 9.8 ± 0.16 μg/g of food at 5% of their body weight per day followed by a 14-day depuration period in which they were fed clean food. Chemical analysis revealed that BDE-209 accumulated in tissues and was metabolized to reductive products ranging from penta- to octaBDEs with 2,2',4,4',5,6'-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-154) being the most accumulative metabolite. By day 28 of the exposure, rates of outer and inner ring deiodination (ORD and IRD, respectively) of thyroxine (T4) were each reduced by ∼74% among treatments. Effects on T4-ORD and T4-IRD remained significant even after the 14-day depuration period. Histological examination of treated fish showed significantly increased thyroid follicular epithelial cell heights and vacuolated hepatocyte nuclei. Enlarged biliary passageways may be the cause of the distinctive liver phenotype observed, although further testing is needed. Altogether, these results suggest that juvenile fish may be uniquely susceptible to thyroid disruptors like PBDEs.",PMC3155082

Both 17α-ethynylestradiol and 17β-trenbolone have been found in the aquatic environment and affect fish reproduction. In this study, we developed a physiologically-based computational model for female fathead minnows (FHM, Pimephales promelas), a small fish species used in ecotoxicology, to simulate how estrogens (i.e., 17α-ethynylestradiol) or androgens (i.e., 17β-trenbolone) affect reproductive endpoints such as plasma concentrations of steroid hormones (e.g., 17β-estradiol and testosterone) and vitellogenin (a precursor to egg yolk proteins). Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, the model was calibrated with data from unexposed, 17α-ethynylestradiol-exposed, and 17β-trenbolone-exposed FHMs. Four Markov chains were simulated, and the chains for each calibrated model parameter (26 in total) converged within 20,000 iterations. With the converged parameter values, we evaluated the model's predictive ability by simulating a variety of independent experimental data. The model predictions agreed with the experimental data well. The physiologically-based computational model represents the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in adult female FHM robustly. The model is useful to estimate how estrogens (e.g., 17α-ethynylestradiol) or androgens (e.g., 17β-trenbolone) affect plasma concentrations of 17β-estradiol, testosterone and vitellogenin, which are important determinants of fecundity in fish.",PMC3118352

They have a long half-life in humans and complex animal toxicity, and accumulating evidence points toward associations with multiple human health endpoints. Our objective was to investigate whether PFC are associated with endocrine disruption in women. Cross-sectional analyses were made between quintiles of serum PFC, serum estradiol, and menopause onset. The C8 Health Project, with cohort of 69,030 adults and children, was conducted due to PFC contamination of drinking water from six water districts in two states. Participants included 25,957 women aged 18-65 yr. Serum estradiol levels and onset of menopause were assessed. The survey was the result of a class action suit, and survey designers (an independent corporation) had no a priori hypotheses. All hypotheses have been formulated by other investigators after data collection. After excluding women who reported hysterectomy and adjusting for age within the group, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and exercise, the odds of having experienced menopause were significantly higher in the highest quintile relative to the lowest quintile of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in the perimenopausal [PFOS odds = 1.4, confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-1.8; PFOA odds =1.4, CI = 1.1-1.8] and menopausal age groups (PFOS odds = 2.1, CI=1.6-2.8; PFOA odds = 1.7, CI = 1.3-2.3).

We examined associations between AGD and semen parameters in adult males. We used multiple regression analyses to model the relationships between sperm parameters and two alternative measures of AGD [from the anus to the posterior base of the scrotum (AGD(AS)) and to the cephalad insertion of the penis (AGD(AP))] in 126 volunteers in Rochester, New York. AGD(AS), but not AGD(AP), was associated with sperm concentration, motility, morphology, total sperm count, and total motile count (p-values, 0.002-0.048). Men with AGD(AS) below (vs. above) the median were 7.3 times more likely (95% confidence interval, 2.5-21.6) to have a low sperm concentration (< 20 × 10⁶/mL). For a typical study participant, sperm concentrations were 34.7 × 10⁶/mL and 51.6 × 10⁶/mL at the 25th and 75th percentiles of (adjusted) AGD(AS). In our population, AGD(AS) was a strong correlate of all semen parameters and a predictor of low sperm concentration. In animals, male AGD at birth reflects androgen levels during the masculinization programming window and predicts adult AGD and reproductive function.

A crucial and as yet unanswered question is whether EDCs have adverse impacts on the sustainability of wildlife populations. There is widespread concern that intersex fish are reproductively compromised, with potential population-level consequences. However, to date, only in vitro sperm quality data are available in support of this hypothesis. The aim of this study was to examine whether wild endocrine-disrupted fish can compete successfully in a realistic breeding scenario. In two competitive breeding experiments using wild roach (Rutilus rutilus), we used DNA microsatellites to assign parentage and thus determine reproductive success of the adults. In both studies, the majority of intersex fish were able to breed, albeit with varying degrees of success. In the first study, where most intersex fish were only mildly feminized, body length was the only factor correlated with reproductive success. In the second study, which included a higher number of more severely intersex fish, reproductive performance was negatively correlated with severity of intersex. The intersex condition reduced reproductive performance by up to 76% for the most feminized individuals in this study, demonstrating a significant adverse effect of intersex on reproductive performance.

Evidence now suggests that epigenetics, i.e. heritable but reversible changes in gene function without changes in nucleotide sequence, links genetics and environment in shaping endocrine function. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA, partition the genome into active and inactive domains based on endogenous and exogenous environmental changes and developmental stages, creating phenotype plasticity that can explain interindividual and population endocrine variability. We will review the current understanding of epigenetics in endocrinology, specifically, the regulation by epigenetics of the three levels of hormone action (synthesis and release, circulating and target tissue levels, and target-organ responsiveness) and the epigenetic action of endocrine disruptors. We will also discuss the impacts of hormones on epigenetics. We propose a three-dimensional model (genetics, environment, and developmental stage) to explain the phenomena related to progressive changes in endocrine functions with age, the early origin of endocrine disorders, phenotype discordance between monozygotic twins, rapid shifts in disease patterns among populations experiencing major lifestyle changes such as immigration, and the many endocrine disruptions in contemporary life. We emphasize that the key for understanding epigenetics in endocrinology is the identification, through advanced high-throughput screening technologies, of plasticity genes or loci that respond directly to a specific environmental stimulus. Investigations to determine whether epigenetic changes induced by today's lifestyles or environmental 'exposures' can be inherited and are reversible should open doors for applying epigenetics to the prevention and treatment of endocrine disorders.",PMC4071959

This network was detected in transgenic mice expressing CD11c-EYFP and CX3CR1-GFP reporters. Epididymal DCs (eDCs) establish intimate interactions with the epithelium and project long dendrites between epithelial cells toward the lumen. We show that isolated eDCs express numerous leukocyte markers described previously in other organs that are in contact with the external environment, and present and cross-present ovalbumin to T cells in vitro. eDCs are, therefore, strategically positioned to regulate the complex interplay between immune tolerance and activation, a balance that is fundamental to male fertility.",PMC3657760

We hypothesized that disruption of these processes by gestational PCB exposure would be detectable as early as the day after birth (postnatal day (P) 1) through alterations in hypothalamic gene and protein expression. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected twice, once each on gestational days 16 and 18, with one of the following: DMSO vehicle; the industrial PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221); a reconstituted mixture of the three most prevalent congeners found in humans, PCB138, PCB153, and PCB180; or estradiol benzoate (EB). On P1, litter composition, anogenital distance (AGD), and body weight were assessed. Pups were euthanized for immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor α (ERα) or TUNEL labeling of apoptotic cells or quantitative PCR of 48 selected genes in the preoptic area (POA). We found that treatment with EB or A1221 had a sex-specific effect on developmental apoptosis in the neonatal anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), a sexually dimorphic hypothalamic region involved in the regulation of reproductive neuroendocrine function. In this region, exposed females had increased numbers of apoptotic nuclei, whereas there was no effect of treatment in males. For ERα, EB treatment increased immunoreactive cell numbers and density in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) of both males and females, while A1221 and the PCB mixture had no effect. PCR analysis of gene expression in the POA identified nine genes that were significantly altered by prenatal EDC exposure, in a manner that varied by sex and treatment. These genes included brain-derived neurotrophic factor, GABA(B) receptors-1 and -2, IGF-1, kisspeptin receptor, NMDA receptor subunits NR2b and NR2c, prodynorphin, and TGFα.

Defects include decreased ductal branching, poorly formed alveolar structures, suppressed expression of milk proteins, and failure to nutritionally support offspring. AHR is activated by numerous environmental toxins, such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and plays an as yet poorly understood role in development and reproduction. To better understand how AHR activation affects pregnancy-associated mammary gland differentiation, we used a combination of ex vivo differentiation, mammary epithelial transplantation, and AHR-deficient mice to determine whether AHR modulates mammary development through a direct effect on mammary epithelial cells (MECs) or by altering paracrine or systemic factors that drive pregnancy-associated differentiation. Studies using mutant mice that express an AHR protein lacking the DNA-binding domain show that defects in pregnancy-associated differentiation require AHR:DNA interactions. We then used fluorescence-based cell sorting to compare changes in gene expression in MECs and whole mammary tissue to gain insight into affected signaling pathways. Our data indicate that activation of the AHR during pregnancy directly affects mammary tissue development via both a direct effect on MECs and through changes in cells of the fat pad, and point to gene targets in MECs and stromal tissues as putative AHR targets.",PMC3099582

Here, we investigated BPA effects during embryonic development using the zebrafish and Xenopus models. We report that BPA exposure leads to severe malformations of the otic vesicle. In zebrafish and in Xenopus embryos, exposure to BPA during the first developmental day resulted in dose-dependent defects in otolith formation. Defects included aggregation, multiplication and occasionally failure to form otoliths. As no effects on otolith development were seen with exposure to micromolar concentrations of thyroid hormone, 17-ß-estradiol or of the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 we conclude that the effects of BPA are independent of estrogen receptors or thyroid-hormone receptors. Na+/K+ ATPases are crucial for otolith formation in zebrafish. Pharmacological inhibition of the major Na+/K+ ATPase with ouabain can rescue the BPA-induced otolith phenotype.

However, lipid metabolism pathways transcriptionally regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) were inhibited in the rat but induced in the mouse, and this differential species response corresponded with repression of the steroidogenic pathway.

SREBP2 expression was detected in all fetal rat testis cells but was highest in Leydig cells. Quantification of SREBP2 immunostaining showed that 500 mg/kg DBP exposure significantly reduced SREBP2 expression in rat fetal Leydig cells but not in seminiferous cords. By Western analysis, total rat testis SREBP2 levels were not altered by DBP exposure.

Ten or more members of the PE class of compounds are known to induce male fetal endocrine toxicity and postnatal reproductive malformations by disrupting androgen production during the sexual differentiation period of development. An early study conducted in the rat pubertal model suggested that dipentyl phthalate (DPeP) may be a more potent testicular toxicant than some more extensively studied phthalates. Regulatory agencies require dose-response and potency data to facilitate risk assessment; however, very little data are currently available for DPeP. The goal of this study was to establish a more comprehensive data set for DPeP, focusing on dose-response and potency information for fetal and postnatal male reproductive endpoints. We dosed pregnant rats on gestational day (GD) 17 or GD 14-18 and subsequently evaluated fetal testicular testosterone (T) production on GD 17.5 and GD 18, respectively. We also dosed pregnant rats on GD 8-18 and evaluated early postnatal endpoints in male offspring. Comparison of these data to data previously obtained under similar conditions for di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate indicates that DPeP is approximately eightfold more potent in reducing fetal T production and two- to threefold more potent in inducing development of early postnatal male reproductive malformations. Additionally, fetal testicular T production was more sensitive to inhibitory effects of DPeP exposure than was gene expression of target genes involved in male reproductive development, supporting the use of this endpoint as a critical effect in the risk assessment process.",PMC3044206

However, mechanisms of endocrine impairment and net effects on demography of biota are poorly understood. Here, we report that experimental exposure of an aquatic bird over 3 years to environmentally relevant dietary MeHg concentrations (0.05-0.3 ppm wet weight) resulted in dose-related increases in male-male pairing behaviour (to 55% of males), and decreases in egg productivity (to 30%). Dosed males showed decreased rates of key courtship behaviours, and were approached less by courting females in comparison to control males. Within dosed groups, homosexual males showed a similar reduction when compared with dosed heterosexual males. We found an average 35 per cent decrease in fledgling production in high-dose birds over the study duration. These results are of interest because (i) MeHg exposure is experimentally tied to demographically important reproductive deficits, (ii) these effects were found at low, chronic exposure levels commonly experienced by wildlife, and (iii) effects on reproductive behaviour and sexual preference mediated by endocrine disruption represent a novel and probably under-reported mechanism by which contaminants may influence wild populations of birds.",PMC3097836

Despite these important roles, it remains unclear whether the PG pathway is a target for endocrine disruption. However, several known endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) share a high degree of structural similarity with mild analgesics. Using cell-based transfection and transduction experiments, mass spectrometry, and organotypic assays together with molecular modeling, we investigated whether inhibition of the PG pathway by known EDCs could be a novel point of endocrine disruption. We found that many known EDCs inhibit the PG pathway in a mouse Sertoli cell line and in human primary mast cells. The EDCs also reduced PG synthesis in ex vivo rat testis, and this reduction was correlated with a reduced testosterone production. The inhibition of PG synthesis occurred without involvement of canonical PG receptors or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which have previously been described as targets of EDCs. Instead, our results suggest that the compounds may bind directly into the active site of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby obstructing the conversion of arachidonic acid to PG precursors without interfering with the expression of the COX enzymes. A common feature of the PG inhibitory EDCs is the presence of aromatic groups that may stabilize binding in the hydrophobic active site of the COX enzymes. Our findings suggest a hitherto unknown mode of action by EDCs through inhibition of the PG pathway and suggest new avenues to investigate effects of EDCs on reproductive and immunological disorders that have become increasingly common in recent decades.",PMC3080937

A complete understanding of how these compounds affect health is complicated because environmental estrogens are a structurally heterogeneous group of compounds. In this work, computational molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to predict the binding affinity of different compounds using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) estrogen receptors (ERs) as a model. Specifically, this study presents a comparison of the binding affinity of the natural ligand estradiol-17β to the four rainbow trout ER isoforms with that of three known environmental estrogens 17α-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, and raloxifene. Two additional compounds, atrazine and testosterone, that are known to be very weak or non-binders to ERs were tested. The binding affinity of these compounds to the human ERα subtype is also included for comparison. The results of this study suggest that, when compared to estradiol-17β, bisphenol A binds less strongly to all four receptors, 17α-ethinylestradiol binds more strongly, and raloxifene has a high affinity for the α subtype only. The results also show that atrazine and testosterone are weak or non-binders to the ERs. All of the results are in excellent qualitative agreement with the known in vivo estrogenicity of these compounds in the rainbow trout and other fishes. Computational estimation of binding affinities could be a valuable tool for predicting the impact of environmental estrogens in fish and other animals.",PMC3022107

It was recently discovered that hypothalamic kisspeptin (KISS) signaling pathways are sexually dimorphic and regulate both the timing of pubertal onset and estrous cyclicity. Thus we hypothesized that disrupted sex specific ontogeny of KISS signaling pathways might be a mechanism underlying these EDC effects. We first established the sex specific development of KISS gene expression, cell number and neural fiber density across peripuberty in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and arcuate nucleus (ARC), hypothesizing that the sexually dimorphic aspects of KISS signaling would be most vulnerable to EDCs. We next exposed female rats to the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN, 1 or 10 mg/kg bw), estradiol benzoate (EB, 10 μg), or vehicle from post natal day (P) 0-3 via subcutaneous (sc) injection. Animals were sacrificed on either P21, 24, 28, or 33 (n=5-14 per group at each age).

A major concern about the toxicity of xenoestrogens (XEs) is potential alteration of responses to physiologic estrogens when XEs are present simultaneously. We examined estrogen-induced ERK activation, comparing the abilities of structurally related XEs (alkylphenols and bisphenol A) to alter ERK responses induced by physiologic concentrations (1 nM) of estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3). We quantified hormone/mimetic-induced ERK phosphorylations in the GH3/B6/F10 rat pituitary cell line using a plate immunoassay, comparing effects with those on cell proliferation and by estrogen receptor subtype-selective ligands. Alone, these structurally related XEs activate ERKs in an oscillating temporal pattern similar (but not identical) to that with physiologic estrogens. The potency of all estrogens was similar (active between femtomolar and nanomolar concentrations). XEs potently disrupted physiologic estrogen signaling at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. Generally, XEs potentiated (at the lowest, subpicomolar concentrations) and attenuated (at the highest, picomolar to 100 nM concentrations) the actions of the physiologic estrogens. Some XEs showed pronounced nonmonotonic responses/inhibitions. The phosphorylated ERK and proliferative responses to receptor-selective ligands were only partially correlated. XEs are both imperfect potent estrogens and endocrine disruptors; the more efficacious an XE, the more it disrupts actions of physiologic estrogens. This ability to disrupt physiologic estrogen signaling suggests that XEs may disturb normal functioning at life stages where actions of particular estrogens are important (e.g., development, reproductive cycling, pregnancy, menopause).",PMC3018487

The goal of this study was to develop a flexible method to facilitate the rational prioritization of chemicals for further evaluation and demonstrate its application as a candidate decision-support tool for EDSP. Focusing on estrogen, androgen, and thyroid pathways, we defined putative endocrine profiles and derived a relative rank or score for the entire ToxCast library of 309 unique chemicals. Effects on other nuclear receptors and xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes were also considered, as were pertinent chemical descriptors and pathways relevant to endocrine-mediated signaling. Combining multiple data sources into an overall, weight-of-evidence Toxicological Priority Index (ToxPi) score for prioritizing further chemical testing resulted in more robust conclusions than any single data source taken alone. Incorporating data from in vitro assays, chemical descriptors, and biological pathways in this prioritization schema provided a flexible, comprehensive visualization and ranking of each chemical's potential endocrine activity.

Baculovirus-expressed recombinant hERalpha and aERalpha were used in a competitive binding assay. Atrazine and cyanazine were not able to bind to either receptor. p,p'-Dicofol was able to bind to aERalpha with a concentration inhibiting 50% of binding (IC50) of 4 microM, while only partially displacing 17beta-estradiol (E2) from hERalpha and yielding a projected IC50 of 45 microM. Chemicals that only partially displaced E2 from either receptor, including some dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolites and trans-nonachlor, appeared to have higher affinity for aERalpha than hERalpha. p,p'-Dicofol-mediated transcriptional activation through aERalpha and hERalpha was assessed to further explore the preferential binding of p,p'-dicofol to aERalpha over hERalpha. p,p'-Dicofol was able to stimulate transcriptional activation in a similar manner with both receptors.

20623170,Quentin Felty,Proteomic 2D DIGE profiling of human vascular endothelial cells exposed to environmentally relevant concentration of endocrine disruptor PCB153 and physiological concentration of 17β-estradiol.,2011,"Considering the recent studies that question previously reported cardio-protective effects of estrogen, there is a growing concern that endocrine disruptors may also contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular disease. PCB153 is one of the most commonly found polychlorinated biphenyls, and based on epidemiological studies, has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. The endocrine disruptor PCB153 has been reported to bind the estrogen receptor alpha, induce vessel formation, and increase the formation of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells. Since PCB153-induced phenotypic changes are similar to estradiol, we postulated that PCB153 activates redox signaling pathways common to 17β-estradiol. Whether the effect of PCB153 on the proteome is comparable to 17β-estradiol is not known. Therefore we investigated the proteome of human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to PCB153 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Using 2D DIGE coupled to MALDI-time of flight (TOF)/TOF MS, we found 96 protein spots significantly (greater than 1.5-fold) modulated by experimental treatments. Mass spectrometry identified 11 of 13 protein spots with high confidence protein score CI that was greater than 95%. Of the identified proteins, lamin A/C and far upstream element-binding protein (FUBP1) were regulated similarly by both treatments. FUBP1 is of particular interest because it controls c-myc. While lamin A/C modulates transcription factor AP-1 function. Interestingly, both c-myc and AP-1 are redox-sensitive transcription factors known to regulate genes required for cell growth. Network analysis of these proteins showed transforming growth factor β-1 and c-myc to play central roles. While our findings do not reveal any mechanisms involved in PCB153-induced vascularization, the identified network does provide a potential target pathway for further mechanistic studies of these relationships.",PMC3226797

BPA has profound effects on luteinizing hormone (LH) surge amplitude, and MXC has profound effects on on LH surge timing in sheep. The neural mechanisms involved in the differential disruption of the LH surge by these two EDCs remain to be elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that the differential effects of BPA and MXC on LH surge system involved changes in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and estrogen receptors (ESR), ESR1 and ESR2, mRNA expression. Pregnant sheep were given daily injections of cottonseed oil (controls), MXC, or BPA (5mg/kg/day) from day 30 to 90 of gestation (term 147d). Offspring from these animals were euthanized as adults, during the late follicular phase following synchronization of estrus with prostaglandin F(2alpha), just before the expected onset of preovulatory LH surge and changes in mRNA expression of hypothalamic GnRH, ESR1, and ESR2 quantified following in situ hybridization. GnRH mRNA expression was significantly lower in both groups of EDC-treated females compared to controls. ESR1 expression was increased in prenatal BPA- but not MXC-treated females in medial preoptic area relative to controls. In contrast, ESR2 expression was reduced in the medial preoptic area of both EDC-treated groups. Differences in expression of ESR1/ESR2 receptors may contribute to the differential effects of BPA and MXC on the LH surge system. These findings provide support that prenatal exposure to EDCs alters the neural developmental trajectory leading to long-term reproductive consequences in the adult female.",PMC2914852

Because of this large scale use there is a critical need to understand the potential for toxicity of the currently used dispersant and potential alternatives, especially given the limited toxicity testing information that is available. In particular, some dispersants contain nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), which can degrade to nonylphenol (NP), a known endocrine disruptor. Given the urgent need to generate toxicity data, we carried out a series of in vitro high-throughput assays on eight commercial dispersants. These assays focused on the estrogen and androgen receptors (ER and AR), but also included a larger battery of assays probing other biological pathways. Cytotoxicity in mammalian cells was also quantified. No activity was seen in any AR assay. Two dispersants showed a weak ER signal in one assay (EC50 of 16 ppm for Nokomis 3-F4 and 25 ppm for ZI-400). NPs and NPEs also had a weak signal in this same ER assay. Note that Corexit 9500, the currently used product, does not contain NPEs and did not show any ER activity. Cytotoxicity values for six of the dispersants were statistically indistinguishable, with median LC50 values approximately 100 ppm.

However, the exact molecular events leading to reproductive dysfunctions as a result of arsenic exposure are yet to be ascertained. This report evaluates the effect and mode of action of chronic oral arsenic exposure on the uterine physiology of mature female albino rats. The effect of chronic oral exposure to arsenic at the dose of 4 microg/ml for 28 days was evaluated on adult female albino rats. Hematoxylin-eosin double staining method evaluated the changes in the histological architecture of the uterus. Circulating levels of gonadotropins and estradiol were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of the estrogen receptor and estrogen-induced genes was studied at the mRNA level by RT-PCR and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Sodium arsenite treatment decreased circulating levels of estradiol in a dose and time-dependent manner, along with decrease in the levels of both LH and FSH. Histological evaluation revealed degeneration of luminal epithelial cells and endometrial glands in response to arsenic treatment, along with reduction in thickness of the longitudinal muscle layer. Concomitantly, downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER alpha), the estrogen-responsive gene - vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and G1 cell cycle proteins, cyclin D1 and CDK4, was also observed. Together, the results indicate that arsenic disrupted the circulating levels of gonadotropins and estradiol, led to degeneration of luminal epithelial, stromal and myometrial cells of the rat uterus and downregulated the downstream components of the estrogen signaling pathway. Since development and functional maintenance of the uterus is under the influence of estradiol, arsenic-induced structural degeneration may be attributed to the reduction in circulating estradiol levels. Downregulation of the estrogen receptor and estrogen-responsive genes in response to arsenic indicates a mechanism of suppression of female reproductive functions by an environmental toxicant that is contra-mechanistic to that of estrogen.",PMC2909245

We have previously described a killifish population resident in a highly polluted Superfund site (New Bedford Harbor, NBH) that shows evidence of exposure to an estrogenic environment and endocrine disruption. Here, we compare NBH with a local reference population (Scorton Creek, SC) for developmental patterns and direct effects of exogenous estradiol on the estrogenic markers, brain cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19A2 or AroB), hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg), and hepatic estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha). In contrast to our previous observation of elevated ER alpha in NBH embryos, developmental levels of AroB and Vtg mRNAs did not differ between the two sites, demonstrating that not all estrogen-responsive genes are upregulated in NBH embryos. A dose-response experiment showed that NBH larvae are less responsive (lower maximum induction, as measured by ER alpha) and less sensitive (higher EC(50) for induction, as measured by AroB) to estradiol than SC larvae, changes that would be adaptive in an estrogenic environment. In contrast, induction of Vtg mRNA is similar in the two populations, indicating that the adaptive mechanism is target gene-specific. Based on the lower basal levels of ER alpha mRNA in several tissues from adult NBH fish vs SC fish (Greytak and Callard, 2007), we predicted estrogen hyporesponsiveness; however, induction of ER alpha by estradiol exposure in reproductively inactive males did not differ between the two sites. Moreover, AroB was more responsive and Vtg induction was greater (2d) or similar (5d) in NBH as compared to SC males. Worth noting is the high inter-individual variability in estrogen responses of gene targets, especially in NBH killifish, which may indicate evolving preadaptive or adaptive mechanisms. In conclusion, although multi-generational exposure to a highly polluted environment is associated with changes in basal levels of ER alpha mRNA, this is not a simple predictor of estrogen responsiveness. We hypothesize that adaptation of killifish to the estrogenic and polluted environment may be occurring through diverse mechanisms that are gene-, tissue type- and life-stage-specific.",PMC2907899

There are strong circumstantial links between environmental EDC exposure and both declining human/wildlife reproductive health and the increasing incidence of reproductive system abnormalities. The verification of such links, however, is difficult and requires animal models exposed to 'real life', environmentally relevant concentrations/mixtures of environmental contaminants (ECs), particularly in utero, when sensitivity to EC exposure is high. The present study aimed to determine whether the foetal sheep reproductive neuroendocrine axis, particularly gondotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and galaninergic systems, were affected by maternal exposure to a complex mixture of chemicals, applied to pasture, in the form of sewage sludge. Sewage sludge contains high concentrations of a spectrum of EDCs and other pollutants, relative to environmental concentrations, but is frequently recycled to land as a fertiliser. We found that foetuses exposed to the EDC mixture in utero through their mothers had lower GnRH mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and lower GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and galanin receptor (GALR) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Strikingly, this, treatment had no significant effect on maternal GnRH or GnRHR mRNA expression, although GALR mRNA expression within the maternal hypothalamus and pituitary gland was reduced. The present study clearly demonstrates that the developing foetal neuroendocrine axis is sensitive to real-world mixtures of environmental chemicals. Given the important role of GnRH and GnRHR in the regulation of reproductive function, its known role programming role in utero, and the role of galanin in the regulation of many physiological/neuroendocrine systems, in utero changes in the activity of these systems are likely to have long-term consequences in adulthood and represent a novel pathway through which EC mixtures could perturb normal reproductive function.",PMC4959564

As PDI is also known to bind various molecules including hormones such as estradiol and thyroxin, we considered the hypothesis that adverse effects of endocrine-disrupter compounds (EDC) could be mediated through their interaction with PDI leading to defects in membrane or secreted proteins. Taking advantage of the recent description of the fluorescence self quenched substrate di-eosin-oxidized-glutathione (DiE-GSSG), we determined kinetically the effects of various potential pharmaceutical EDCs on the in-vitro reductase activity of bovine liver PDI by measuring the fluorescence of the reaction product (E-GSH). Our data show that estrogens (ethynylestradiol and bisphenol-A) as well as indomethacin exert an inhibition whereas medroxyprogesteroneacetate and nortestosterone exert a potentiation of bovine PDI reductase activity. The present data indicate that the tested EDCs could not only affect endocrine target cells through nuclear receptors as previously shown, but could also affect these and all other cells by positively or negatively affecting PDI activity. The substrate DiE-GSSG has been demonstrated to be a convenient substrate to measure PDI reductase activity in the presence of various potential EDCs.

Nearly 600 serum samples from the California and Ohio sites were analyzed for lipids, 35 PCB congeners, 11 PBDE congeners, and 9 OCPs. The biomarker distributions were examined and geometric means compared for selected analytes across categories of age, race, site, body mass index (BMI), parental education, maternal age at delivery, and breast feeding in adjusted models. Six PBDE congeners were detected among greater than 70% of samples, with BDE-47 having the highest concentration (median 42.2, range 4.9-855 ng/g lipid). Girls in California had adjusted geometric mean (GM) PBDE levels significantly higher than girls in Ohio. Furthermore, Blacks had significantly higher adjusted GMs of all six PBDE congeners than Whites, and Hispanics had intermediate values. GMs tended to be lower among more obese girls, while other variables were not strongly associated. In contrast, GMs of the six PCB congeners most frequently detected were significantly lower among Blacks and Hispanics than Whites. PCBs and the three pesticides most frequently detected were also consistently lower among girls with high BMI, who were not breast-fed, whose mothers were younger, or whose care-givers (usually parents) were less educated. Girls in California had higher GMs than in Ohio for the pesticides and most PCB congeners, but the opposite for CB-99 and -118. Several of these potential HAAs were detected in nearly all of these young girls, some at relatively high levels, with variation by geographic location and other demographic factors that may reflect exposure pathways.

Data interpretation and their quantitative use in human and ecological risk assessments can be enhanced with mechanistic computational models to help define mechanisms of action and improve understanding of intracellular concentration-response behavior. The goal of this study was to develop a mechanistic computational model of the metabolic network of adrenal steroidogenesis to estimate the synthesis and secretion of adrenal steroids in human H295R cells and their biochemical response to steroidogenesis-disrupting EAC. We developed a deterministic model that describes the biosynthetic pathways for the conversion of cholesterol to adrenal steroids and the kinetics for enzyme inhibition by metryrapone (MET), a model EAC. Using a nonlinear parameter estimation method, the model was fitted to the measurements from an in vitro steroidogenesis assay using H295R cells. Model-predicted steroid concentrations in cells and culture medium corresponded well to the time-course measurements from control and MET-exposed cells. A sensitivity analysis indicated the parameter uncertainties and identified transport and metabolic processes that most influenced the concentrations of primary adrenal steroids, aldosterone and cortisol.

Traditional receptor-mediated reporter assays in yeast were performed twelve to twenty four hours after ligand addition, used colorimetric substrates, and, in many cases, required high, non-physiological concentrations of ligand. With the advent of new chemiluminescent substrates a ligand-induced signal can be detected within thirty minutes using high picomolar to low nanomolar concentrations of estrogen. As a result of the sensitivity (EC(50) for estradiol is approximately 0.7nM) and the very short assay time (2-4h) environmental water samples can typically be assayed directly without sterilization, extraction, and concentration. Thus, these assays represent rapid and sensitive approaches for determining the presence of contaminants in environmental samples.

We investigated whether BPA affects human ovarian granulosa cell function. We treated KGN granulosa cells and granulosa cells from subjects undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), BPA, or BPA plus FSH in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We then evaluated expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), aromatase, and transcription factors known to mediate aromatase induction by FSH [including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), GATA4, cAMP response element binding protein-1 (CREB-1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)], as well as 17beta-estradiol (E2) secretion. KGN cells were transfected with a PPARgamma-containing vector, followed by assessment of aromatase and IGF-I expression. BPA reduced FSH-induced IGF-1 and aromatase expression and E2 secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar effects on aromatase were observed in IVF granulosa cells. SF-1 and GATA4, but not CREB-1, were reduced after BPA treatment, although PPARgamma, an inhibitor of aromatase, was significantly up-regulated by BPA in a dose-dependent manner, with simultaneous decrease of aromatase. Overexpression of PPARgamma in KGN cells reduced FSH-stimulated aromatase and IGF-1 mRNAs, with increasing concentrations of the transfected expression vector, mimicking BPA action. Also, BPA reduced granulosa cell DNA synthesis without changing DNA fragmentation, suggesting that BPA does not induce apoptosis. Overall, the data demonstrate that BPA induces PPARgamma, which mediates down-regulation of FSH-stimulated IGF-1, SF-1, GATA4, aromatase, and E2 in human granulosa cells.

Phytoestrogens are a class of endocrine disruptors found in plants. In the current study we examined the effects of exposure at various perinatal time periods to genistein, a soy phytoestrogen, on reproductive development and learning in male rats. Dams were fed genistein-containing (5 mg/kg feed) food during both gestation and lactation, during gestation only, during lactation only, or during neither period. Measures of reproductive development and body mass were taken in the male offspring during postnatal development, and learning and memory performance was assessed in adulthood. Genistein exposure via the maternal diet decreased body mass in the male offspring of dams fed genistein during both gestation and lactation, during lactation only, but not during gestation only. Genistein decreased anogenital distance when exposure was during both gestation and lactation, but there was no effect when exposure was limited to one of these time periods. Similarly, spatial learning in the Morris water maze was impaired in male rats exposed to genistein during both gestation and lactation, but not in rats exposed during only one of these time periods. There was no effect of genistein on cued or contextual fear conditioning. In summary, the data indicate that exposure to genistein through the maternal diet significantly impacts growth in male offspring if exposure is during lactation.

The primary metabolite of EGME is methoxyacetic acid (MAA), a short-chain fatty acid that inhibits histone deacetylase activity and alters gene expression. Because estrogen signaling is necessary for normal reproductive function and modulates gene expression, the estrogen-signaling pathway is a likely target for MAA; however, little is known about the effects of MAA in this regard. We evaluated the mechanistic effects of MAA on estrogen receptor (ER) expression and estrogen signaling using in vitro and in vivo model systems. MAA potentiates 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) stimulation of an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid in HeLa cells transiently transfected with either a human ERalpha or ERbeta expression vector containing a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. This result is attributed to increased exogenous ER expression due to MAA-mediated activation of the CMV promoter. In contrast to its effects on exogenous ER, MAA decreases endogenous ERalpha expression and attenuates E(2)-stimulated endogenous gene expression in both MCF-7 cells and the mouse uterus. These results illustrate the importance of careful experimental design and analysis when assessing the potential endocrine-disrupting properties of a compound to ensure biological responses are in concordance with in vitro analyses. Given the established role of the ER in normal reproductive function, the effects of MAA on the endogenous ER reported here are consistent with the reproductive abnormalities observed after EGME exposure and suggest that these toxicities may be due, at least in part, to attenuation of endogenous ER-mediated signaling.",PMC2801194

The aim of the current field study was to investigate the occurrence and main sources of phenolic endocrine disruptors in Ria de Aveiro. An extensive sampling campaign was performed, with surface water and wastewater grab samples taken at over 50 locations, in duplicate on different days. Samples were treated using solid phase extraction and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

Samples from the harbours showed EDC levels similar to those in the rest of the lagoon, but in the city of Aveiro, elevated concentrations were observed for alkylphenol ethoxylates (A9PEO), A9PEC, PhP and BPA. Wastewater effluents showed low levels for parabens, whilst alkylphenolic compounds reached several micrograms per litre.

The main sources for all investigated EDCs were the rivers Caster and Antuã which discharge into the lagoon. The city of Aveiro was identified as a secondary source.

Because glucocorticoid signaling is central to adipocyte differentiation, the ability of EDCs to stimulate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and drive adipogenesis was assessed in the 3T3-L1 cell line. Various EDCs were screened for glucocorticoid-like activity using a luciferase reporter construct, and four (bisphenol A (BPA), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), endrin, and tolylfluanid (TF)) were shown to significantly stimulate GR without significant activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were then treated with EDCs and a weak differentiation cocktail containing dehydrocorticosterone (DHC) in place of the synthetic dexamethasone. The capacity of these compounds to promote adipogenesis was assessed by quantitative oil red O staining and immunoblotting for adipocyte-specific proteins. The four EDCs increased lipid accumulation in the differentiating adipocytes and also upregulated the expression of adipocytic proteins. Interestingly, proadipogenic effects were observed at picomolar concentrations for several of the EDCs. Because there was no detectable adipogenesis when the preadipocytes were treated with compounds alone, the EDCs are likely promoting adipocyte differentiation by synergizing with agents present in the differentiation cocktail. Thus, EDCs are able to promote adipogenesis through the activation of the GR, further implicating these compounds in the rising rates of obesity and diabetes.",PMC3957336

Various in vivo and in vitro assays have been developed to screen these xenoestrogens. However, traditional in vivo assays are laborious and unsuitable for large-scale screening, and in vitro assays do not necessarily replicate in vivo functioning. To overcome these limitations, we developed a transient expression assay in zebrafish, into which a brain aromatase (cyp19a1b)-based estrogen-responsive reporter gene was introduced. In response to 17beta-estradiol (10(-6) M) and heptachlor (10(-6) M), zebrafish embryos carrying the reporter construct expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein in the olfactory bulb, telencephalon, preoptic area, and mediobasal hypothalamus. This system will serve to model the in vivo conversion and breakdown of estrogenic compounds and thus provide a rapid preliminary screening method to estimate their estrogenicity.",PMC2771600

They use environmental cues to synchronize reproduction. Photoperiod is the proximate cue, initiating vitellogenesis in a temperature-compensated process. The prevailing paradigm in Nereidae is of a single 'juvenile' hormone controlling growth and reproduction. However, a new multi-hormone model is presented here that integrates the environmental and endocrine control of reproduction. This is supported by evidence from in vitro bioassays. The juvenile hormone is shown to be heat stable and cross reactive between species. In addition, a second neuro-hormone, identified here as a gonadotrophic hormone, is shown to be present in mature females and is found to promote oocyte growth. Furthermore, dopamine and melatonin appear to switch off the juvenile hormone while serotonin and oxytocin promote oocyte growth. Global warming is likely to uncouple the phase relationship between temperature and photoperiod, with significant consequences for Nereidae that use photoperiod to cue reproduction during the winter in northern latitudes. Genotypic adaptation of the photoperiodic response may be possible, but significant impacts on fecundity, spawning success and recruitment are likely in response to short-term extreme events. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals may also impact on putative steroid hormone pathways in Nereidae with similar consequences. These impacts may have significant implications for the functional role of Nereidae and highlight the importance of comparative endocrinology studies in these and other invertebrates.",PMC2781847

It has been suggested, however, that in utero hormone levels may be related to risk. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) compounds, may alter hormone levels and thereby affect the fetus. To examine whether in utero PCB exposure is related to cryptorchidism and hypospadias, we examined PCB levels among pregnant women enrolled in the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP). The CPP enrolled pregnant women at 12 U.S. medical centers between 1959 and 1965. For the present research, we analyzed third-trimester serum samples from the mothers of 230 sons with cryptorchidism, 201 sons with hypospadias, and 593 sons with neither condition. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using logistic regression and examined the associations of each anomaly with individual PCB congener levels, sum of PCBs, and several functional groupings of PCBs. In general, the ORs for cryptorchidism or hypospadias showed no notable associations with individual PCB congener levels or functional groupings of PCBs. However, the ORs and 95% CIs for the sum of PCBs associated with hypospadias were as follows: 0-1.9 microg/L, reference group; 2-2.9 microg/L, OR = 1.57, 95% CI, 1.05-2.34; 3-3.9 microg/L, OR = 1.45, 95% CI, 0.90-2.34; and > or = 4.0 microg/L, OR = 1.69, 95% CI, 1.06-2.68; p-value for trend = 0.08. Given the large number of associations examined, these findings do not strongly support the hypothesis that PCBs are associated with cryptorchidism or hypospadias. Because population serum PCB levels at the time of sample collection were considerably higher than levels at present, it is unlikely that current PCB exposure is related to the development of either anomaly.",PMC2737028

Pregnant CD rats were exposed by gavage daily during gestation to vehicle or to butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP) in vehicle at a level known to induce effects in the offspring and at a level previously not shown to induce effects. Urine was collected for 24 h (on dry ice using all glass metabolism chambers) from dams on gestational day 18 (during exposure) and on post natal day (pnd) 21, and from pnd 25 pups. Traditional phenotypic anchors were measured in pups (between pnd 0 and pnd 26). Metabolomics of urine collected from dams exposed to vehicle or BBP exhibited different patterns for endogenous metabolites. Even three weeks after gestational exposure, metabolic profiles of endogenous compounds in urine could differentiate dams that received the vehicle, low dose or high dose of BBP. Metabolic profiles could differentiate male from female pups, pups born to dams receiving the vehicle, low or high BBP dose, and pups with observable adverse reproductive effects from pups with no observed effects. Metabolites significant to the separation of dose groups and their relationship with effects measured in the study were mapped to biochemical pathways for determining mechanistic relevance.

Studies of prenatally-exposed males have yielded conflicting results. In data from a collaborative follow-up of three U.S. cohorts of DES-exposed sons, we examined the relation of prenatal DES exposure to occurrence of male urogenital abnormalities. Exposure status was determined through review of prenatal records. Mailed questionnaires (1994, 1997, 2001) asked about specified abnormalities of the urogenital tract. Risk ratios (RR) were estimated by Cox regression with constant time at risk and control for year of birth. Prenatal DES exposure was not associated with varicocele, structural abnormalities of the penis, urethral stenosis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, or inflammation/infection of the prostate, urethra, or epididymus. However, RRs were 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.13.4) for cryptorchidism, 2.5 (1.54.3) for epididymal cyst, and 2.4 (1.54.4) for testicular inflammation/infection. Stronger associations were observed for DES exposure that began before the 11th week of pregnancy: RRs were 2.9 (1.65.2) for cryptorchidism, 3.5 (2.06.0) for epididymal cyst, and 3.0 (1.75.4) for inflammation/infection of testes. These results indicate that prenatal exposure to DES increases risk of male urogenital abnormalities and that the association is strongest for exposure that occurs early in gestation. The findings support the hypothesis that endocrine disrupting chemicals may be a cause of the increased prevalence of cryptorchidism that has been seen in recent years.",PMC2739506

The adrenal is a target of endocrine disruption that could influence tumor formation at other sites. Thus, we examined possible fetal arsenic-induced adrenal effects as a potential basis of arsenic enhancement of DES carcinogenesis. Pregnant CD1 mice were given drinking water containing 85 ppm arsenic as sodium arsenite or unaltered water from day 8 to day 18 of gestation and were allowed to deliver normally. Groups of offspring were subsequently injected s.c. on postpartum days 1-5 with DES (2 microg/pup/day) and killed on postnatal day 12. Total RNA was isolated from the whole adrenal glands, and the expression of various genes was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Fetal arsenic exposure greatly enhanced DES-induced, estrogen-linked gene expression, such as estrogen receptor-alpha and trefoil factors. Expression of genes involved with steroid metabolism and/or methionine metabolism was also increased, including genes encoding for 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 (HSD17beta5) and androstenedione 15alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp2a4). The transcripts for homocysteine cycling genes (betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase and thioether S-methyltransferase) and developmental marker genes (alpha-fetoprotein, insulin-like growth factor 2 and IGF binding protein-1), were also higher with arsenic plus DES than either treatment alone. Thus, exposure of the mouse to arsenic during a critical period of fetal development may potentially alter adrenal genetic programming, leading to endocrine disruption and potentially enhancing tumor formation together with DES at other sites much later in life. Functional studies, such as changes in circulating steroids, would greatly support this hypothesis, and are planned.",PMC7291701

Polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), a brominated flame retardant, is one such suspected endocrine disruptor. We investigated the relationship between maternal serum levels of PBBs and GU conditions among male offspring exposed in utero. In this cohort study of sons born to women accidentally exposed to PBBs during 1973-1974, we examined self-reported data on GU conditions among male offspring in relation to maternal serum PBB levels. We used generalized estimating equations to calculate odds ratios (ORs), controlling for gestational age at birth. Of 464 sons, 33 reported any GU condition (13 hernias, 10 hydroceles, 9 cryptorchidism, 5 hypospadias, and 1 varicocele). Four reported both hernia and hydrocele, and one both hernia and cryptorchidism.

This risk was increased when we excluded sons born after the exposure but before the mother's serum PBB measurement (OR = 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0-9.1). We found evidence of a 3-fold increase in reported hernia or hydrocele among sons with higher PBB exposure (test of trend p-value = 0.04).

We analyzed serum samples for levels of 10 different PFAAs and reproductive hormones and assessed semen quality in 105 Danish men from the general population (median age, 19 years). Considerable levels of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid were found in all young men (medians of 24.5, 4.9, and 6.6 ng/mL, respectively). Men with high combined levels of PFOS and PFOA had a median of 6.2 million normal spermatozoa in their ejaculate in contrast to 15.5 million among men with low PFOS-PFOA (p = 0.030). In addition, we found nonsignificant trends with regard to lower sperm concentration, lower total sperm counts, and altered pituitary-gonadal hormones among men with high PFOS-PFOA levels. High PFAA levels were associated with fewer normal sperm. Thus, high levels of PFAAs may contribute to the otherwise unexplained low semen quality often seen in young men.

Timed pregnant CD-1 mice were treated on days 9-16 of gestation with BPA (0.1, 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 mug/kg/day). After delivery, pups were held for 18 months; reproductive tissues were then evaluated. Ovarian cysts were significantly increased in the 1-mug/kg BPA group; ovarian cyst-adenomas were seen in the other three BPA-treated groups but not in corn-oil controls. We observed increased progressive proliferative lesions of the oviduct after BPA treatment, similar to those described in response to DES. Further, although not statistically different from the controls, prominent mesonephric (Wolffian) remnants and squamous metaplasia of the uterus, as well as vaginal adenosis, were present in BPA-treated mice, similar to lesions reported following DES treatment. More severe pathologies observed in some BPA-treated animals included atypical hyperplasia and stromal polyps of the uterus; sarcoma of the uterine cervix; and mammary adenocarcinoma.

Methoxychlor (MXC) and its metabolites possess estrogenic, antiestrogenic, and antiandrogenic activities. Previous studies showed that fetal/neonatal exposure to MXC caused adult ovarian dysfunction due to altered expression of key ovarian genes including estrogen receptor (ER)-beta, which was down-regulated, whereas ERalpha was unaffected. The objective of the current study was to evaluate changes in global and gene-specific methylation patterns in adult ovaries associated with the observed defects. Rats were exposed to MXC (20 microg/kgxd or 100 mg/kg.d) between embryonic d 19 and postnatal d 7. We performed DNA methylation analysis of the known promoters of ERalpha and ERbeta genes in postnatal d 50-60 ovaries using bisulfite sequencing and methylation-specific PCRs. Developmental exposure to MXC led to significant hypermethylation in the ERbeta promoter regions (P < 0.05), whereas the ERalpha promoter was unaffected. We assessed global DNA methylation changes using methylation-sensitive arbitrarily primed PCR and identified 10 genes that were hypermethylated in ovaries from exposed rats. To determine whether the MXC-induced methylation changes were associated with increased DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) levels, we measured the expression levels of Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3l using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Whereas Dnmt3a and Dnmt3l were unchanged, Dnmt3b expression was stimulated in ovaries of the 100 mg/kg MXC group (P < 0.05), suggesting that increased DNMT3B may cause DNA hypermethylation in the ovary.

Growing evidence suggests that kisspeptin (KISS) neurons play a significant role in the regulation of pubertal onset and ovulation, therefore disruption of KISS signaling could be a mechanism by which EDCs impair reproductive maturation and function. We have previously demonstrated that neonatal exposure to phytoestrogens decreases KISS fiber density in the anterior hypothalamus of female rats, an effect which was associated with early persistent estrus and the impaired activation gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. The goals of the present study were to (1) determine if an ERalpha selective agonist (PPT) or bisphenol-A (BPA) could produce similar effects on hypothalamic KISS content in female rats and (2) to determine if male KISS fiber density was also vulnerable to disruption by EDCs. We first examined the effects of neonatal exposure to PPT, a low (50 microg/kg bw) BPA dose, and a high (50 mg/kg bw) BPA dose on KISS immunoreactivity (-ir) in the anterior ventral periventricular (AVPV) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei of adult female rats, using estradiol benzoate (EB) and a sesame oil vehicle as controls. AVPV KISS-ir, following ovariectomy (OVX) and hormone priming, was significantly lower in the EB and PPT groups but not the BPA groups.

Studies in vitro showed that treatment of channel catfish with a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon increased phase I and phase II metabolism of MXC. To determine the in vivo significance, groups of four channel catfish were treated by gavage for 6 days with 2 mg/kg (14)C-MXC alone or 2 mg/kg (14)C-MXC and 2 mg/kg benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). On day 7, blood and tissue samples were taken for analysis. Hepatic ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity was 10-fold higher in the BaP-treated catfish, indicating CYP1A induction. More MXC-derived radioactivity remained in control (42.8 +/- 4.1%) than BaP-induced catfish (28.5 +/- 3.2%), mean percent total dose +/- SE. Bile, muscle and fat contained approximately 90% of the radioactivity remaining in control and induced catfish. Extraction and chromatographic analysis showed that liver contained MXC, OH-MXC, HPTE, and glucuronide but not sulfate conjugates of OH-MXC and HPTE. Liver mitochondria contained more MXC, OH-MXC, and HPTE than other subcellular fractions. Bile contained glucuronides of OH-MXC and HPTE, and hydrolysis of bile gave HPTE and both enantiomers of OH-MXC. The muscle, visceral fat, brain and gonads contained MXC, OH-MXC, and HPTE in varying proportions, but no conjugates. This study showed that catfish coexposed to BaP and MXC retained less MXC and metabolites in tissues than those exposed to MXC alone, suggesting that induction enhanced the elimination of MXC, and further showed that potentially toxic metabolites of MXC were present in the edible tissues.",PMC2664691

Genistein at 500 ppm and EE(2) at 50 ppb produced similar effects in continuously exposed rats, including decreased body weights, accelerated vaginal opening, and altered estrous cycles in young animals. At the high dose, anogenital distance was subtly affected by both compounds, and a reduction in litter size was evident in genistein-treated animals. Genistein at 500 ppm induced an early onset of aberrant cycles relative to controls in the chronic studies. EE(2) significantly increased the incidence of uterine lesions (atypical focal hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia).

This epidemic may be affected by exposure to xenobiotic chemicals. Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, is detectable at nanomolar levels in human serum worldwide. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific hormone that increases insulin sensitivity and reduces tissue inflammation. Thus, any factor that suppresses adiponectin release could lead to insulin resistance and increased susceptibility to obesity-associated diseases. In this study we aimed to compare a) the effects of low doses of BPA and estradiol (E(2)) on adiponectin secretion from human breast, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose explants and mature adipocytes, and b) expression of putative estrogen and estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) in these tissues. We determined adiponectin levels in conditioned media from adipose explants or adipocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. We determined expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha and beta, G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), and ERRs alpha, beta, and gamma by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. BPA at 0.1 and 1 nM doses suppressed adiponectin release from all adipose depots examined. Despite substantial variability among patients, BPA was as effective, and often more effective, than equimolar concentrations of E(2). Adipose tissue expresses similar mRNA levels of ERalpha, ERbeta, and ERRgamma, and 20- to 30-fold lower levels of GPR30, ERRalpha, and ERRbeta. BPA at environmentally relevant doses inhibits the release of a key adipokine that protects humans from metabolic syndrome.

This treatment paradigm also eliminates the preovulatory rise of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). It remains unclear, however, through which of the two primary forms of the estrogen receptor (ERalpha or ERbeta) this effect is mediated. It is also unclear whether endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) can produce similar effects. Here we compared the effect of neonatal exposure to estradiol benzoate (EB), the ERalpha specific agonist 1,3,5-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propyl-1H-pyrazole (PPT), the ERbeta specific agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN) and the naturally occurring EDCs genistein (GEN) and equol (EQ) on pubertal onset, estrous cyclicity, GnRH activation, and kisspeptin content in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei. Vaginal opening was significantly advanced by EB and GEN. By 10 weeks post-puberty, irregular estrous cycles were observed in all groups except the control group. GnRH activation, as measured by the percentage of immunopositive GnRH neurons that were also immunopositive for Fos, was significantly lower in all treatment groups except the DPN group compared to the control group. GnRH activation was absent in the PPT group. These data suggest that neonatal exposure to EDCs can suppress GnRH activity in adulthood, and that ERalpha plays a pivotal role in this process. Kisspeptins (KISS) have recently been characterized to be potent stimulators of GnRH secretion. Therefore we quantified the density of KISS immunolabeled fibers in the AVPV and ARC. In the AVPV, KISS fiber density was significantly lower in the EB and GEN groups compared to the control group but only in the EB and PPT groups in the ARC. The data suggest that decreased stimulation of GnRH neurons by KISS could be a mechanism by which EDCs can impair female reproductive function.",PMC2647326

Longer residence times and elevated contaminant concentrations in the indoor environment may increase chances of exposure to these contaminants by 1000-fold compared to outdoor exposure. To investigate the occurrence of semi-volatile endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), phthalates, pyrethroids, DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and its metabolites, and chlordanes, indoor dust samples were collected from household vacuum cleaner bags provided by 10 apartments and 1 community hall in Davis, California, USA. Chemical analyses show that all indoor dust samples are highly contaminated by target analytes measured in the present study. Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate was the most abundant (104-7630 microg/g) in all samples and higher than other target analytes by 2 to 6 orders of magnitude. PBDEs were also found at high concentrations (1780-25,200 ng/g). Although the use of PCBs has been banned or restricted for decades, some samples had PCBs at levels that are considered to be concerns for human health, indicating that the potential risk posed by PCBs still remains high in the indoor environment, probably due to a lack of dissipation processes and continuous release from the sources. Although the use of some PBDEs is being phased out in some parts of the U.S., this trend may apply to PBDEs as well. We can anticipate that exposure to PBDEs will continue as long as the general public keeps using existing household items such as sofas, mattresses, and carpets that contain PBDEs.

Prostatic inflammation (prostatitis) affects 9% of men of all ages, and > 90% of cases are of unknown etiology. In this study we aimed to evaluate effects of in utero exposure to the antiandrogenic EDC vinclozolin, during the period of male reproductive tract development, on neonatal, prepubertal, and postpubertal prostate gland function of male offspring. Fetal rats were exposed to vinclozolin (100 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle control (2.5 mL/kg body weight) in utero from gestational day 14 (GD14) to GD19 via oral administration to pregnant dams. Tissue analysis was carried out when male offspring were 0, 4, or 8 weeks of age. In utero exposure to vinclozolin was insufficient to perturb prostatic development and branching, although expression of androgen receptor and mesenchymal fibroblast growth factor-10 was down-regulated. Prostate histology remained normal until puberty, but 100% of animals displayed prostatitis postpubertally (56 days of age). Prostatic inflammation was associated with phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkappaB) and postpubertal activation of proinflammatory NFkappaB-dependent genes, including the chemokine interleukin-8 and the cytokine transforming growth factor-beta1. Significantly, inflammation arising from vinclozolin exposure was not associated with the emergence of premalignant lesions, such as prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia or proliferative inflammatory atrophy, and hence mimics nonbacterial early-onset prostatitis that commonly occurs in young men.

We have investigated the impact of estrogen-mediated extranuclear-initiated pathways on global gene expression by using estrogen-dendrimer conjugates (EDCs), which because of their charge and size remain outside the nucleus and can only initiate extranuclear signaling. Genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells identified a subset of 17beta-estradiol (E2)-regulated genes ( approximately 25%) as EDC responsive. The EDC and E2-elicited increases in gene expression were due to increases in gene transcription, as observed in nuclear run-on assays and RNA polymerase II recruitment and phosphorylation. Treatment with antiestrogen or ERalpha knockdown using small interfering RNA abolished EDC-mediated gene stimulation, whereas GPR30 knockdown or treatment with a GPR30-selective ligand was without effect, indicating ER as the mediator of these gene regulations. Inhibitors of MAPK kinase and c-Src suppressed both E2 and EDC stimulated gene expression. Of note, in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, EDC was unable to recruit ERalpha to estrogen-responsive regions of regulated genes, whereas ERalpha recruitment by E2 was very effective. These findings suggest that other transcription factors or kinases that are downstream effectors of EDC-initiated extranuclear signaling cascades are recruited to regulatory regions of EDC-responsive genes in order to elicit gene stimulation. This study thus highlights the importance of inputs from both nuclear and extranuclear ER signaling pathways in regulating patterns of gene expression in breast cancer cells.",PMC2631368

One recently identified mode of endocrine disruption is through hormone sensitization, where the EDC modulates intracellular signaling pathways that control nuclear receptor function, thereby regulating receptor transcriptional activity indirectly. Methoxyacetic acid (MAA), the primary, active metabolite of the industrial solvent ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and a testicular toxicant, belongs to this EDC class. Modulation of nuclear receptor activity by MAA could contribute to the testicular toxicity associated with MAA exposure. In the present study, we evaluated the impact of MAA on the transcriptional activity of several nuclear receptors including the androgen receptor (AR), which plays a pivotal role in the development and maturation of spermatocytes. AR transcriptional activity is shown to be increased by MAA through a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway that involves PI3-kinase. In a combinatorial setting with AR antagonists, MAA potentiated the AR response without significantly altering the EC(50) for androgen responsiveness, partially alleviating the antagonistic effect of the anti-androgens. Finally, MAA treatment of TM3 mouse testicular Leydig cells markedly increased the expression of Cyp17a1 and Shbg while suppressing Igfbp3 expression by ~90%. Deregulation of these genes may alter androgen synthesis and action in a manner that contributes to MAA-induced testicular toxicity.",PMC2742301

Our goal in this study was to test the PBDE mixture DE-71 for estrogenic activity. We used proliferation of cultured breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and trophic effects in the reproductive tracts of ovariectomized mice as estrogen bioassays. DE-71 was administered to mice by subcutaneous injection (sc) or oral gavage (po), alone or in combination with estradiol, for 3 or 34 days. Liver weights and cytochrome P450 enzyme activities were also measured. DE-71 increased MCF-7 cell proliferation, and this was prevented by antiestrogen. DE-71 cotreatment reduced the effect of estradiol in MCF-7 cells. In the mouse 3-day assay, DE-71 administered alone had no effect on uterine weight, uterine epithelial height (UEH), or vaginal epithelial thickness (VET); however, when DE-71 was administered as a cotreatment, it potentiated estradiol's effect on uterine weight. DE-71 administered sc to BALB/c mice for 34 days slightly increased UEH and VET, and attenuated the estradiol-induced increase in UEH; these effects were not seen in BALB/c mice treated po or in C57BL/6 mice treated sc. DE-71 increased liver weight in BALB/c, C57BL/6, and estrogen receptor-alpha knockout mice. We also found an increase in liver cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) and CYP2B activities when DE-71 was administered po, but only CYP2B increased after sc treatment. DE-71 behaves as a weak estrogen.

However, EDCs failed to differentiate into functional cardiac myocytes in vivo as demonstrated by the absence of stimulation-evoked intracellular calcium transients following transplantation into the peri-infarct zone.

We quantified hypothalamic GnRH mRNA, serum luteinizing hormone concentrations, and serum testosterone levels as indices of hypothalamic, pituitary, and gonadal functions, respectively. The results indicate that the hypothalamic and gonadal levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are significantly altered by MDMA, with GnRH mRNA and serum testosterone levels suppressed in rats administered MDMA compared to saline.

In both generations, litter sex ratio was skewed toward females. In the F1 generation, additional effects were found, including a significant alteration of serum LH in the 1 mg/kg A1221 group. The F2 generation showed more profound alterations, particularly with respect to fluctuations in hormones and reproductive tract tissues across the estrous cycle. On proestrus, the day of the preovulatory GnRH/gonadotropin surge, F2 females whose mothers had been exposed perinatally to A1221 exhibited substantially suppressed LH and progesterone concentrations, and correspondingly smaller uterine and ovarian weights on estrus, compared with F2 descendants of control rats. These latter changes suggest a dysregulation of reproductive physiology.

In this study, the involvement of estrogen receptors (ER) in these events was evaluated in three human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3. The Cd-induced signal activation patterns in the three cell lines mimicked those exhibited in response to 17 beta-estradiol. Specifically, treatment of MCF-7 cells, that express ER alpha, ER beta and GPR30, to 0.5-10 microM Cd for only 2.5 min resulted in transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Cd also triggered a gradual increase and sustained activation of AKT during the 60 min treatment period. In SK-BR-3 cells, that express only GPR30, Cd also caused a transient activation of ERK1/2, but not of AKT. In contrast, in MDA-MB-231 cells, that express only ER beta, Cd was unable to cause rapid activation of either ERK1/2 or AKT. A transient phosphorylation of ER alpha was also observed within 2.5 min of Cd exposure in the MCF-7 cells. While the estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, did not prevent the effect of Cd on these signals, specific siRNA against hER alpha significantly reduced Cd-induced activation of ERK1/2 and completely blocked the activation of AKT.

We used several in vitro and ex vivo assays in an attempt to identify suitable biomarkers for antithyroid action testing a selected panel of putative EDCs. In vitro we detected stimulation or inhibition of iodide uptake into FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, inhibition of thyroid hormone binding to transthyretin, agonistic or antagonistic effects in a thyroid hormone receptor-dependent reporter assay, and inhibition of thyroid peroxidase using a novel assay system based on human recombinant thyroperoxidase that might be suitable for routine screening for potential EDCs. In rats, chronic application of several EDCs led to changes in thyroid morphology, alterations of thyrotropin and thyroid hormone serum levels as well as alterations in peripheral thyroid hormone-regulated end points such as malic enzyme and type I 5'-deiodinase activity. As the effects of EDCs do not reflect classic mechanisms of hormone-dependent regulation and feedback, we believe multitarget and multimodal actions of EDCs affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. These complex effects require a diverse approach for screening, evaluation, and risk assessment of potential antithyroid compounds. This approach involves novel in vitro or cell-based screening assays in order to assess thyroid hormone synthesis, transport, metabolism, and action as well as in vivo assays to measure thyroid hormone-regulated tissue-specific and developmental end points in animals.",PMC2174406

Androgen receptor (AR), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), ER-alpha, and ER-beta expression in prostate were altered at mRNA and protein levels, with stronger effects in dorsolateral than ventral prostate. To assess sensitivity of target genes to estrogens, offspring were castrated on postnatal day 70, injected with 17beta-estradiol (E(2); 10 or 50 microg/kg, sc) or vehicle on postnatal day 84, and sacrificed 6 hr later. Acute repression of AR and IGF-1 mRNAs by E(2), studied in ventral prostate, was reduced by 4-MBC exposure. This was accompanied by reduced co-repressor N-CoR (nuclear receptor co-repressor) protein in ventral and dorsolateral prostate, whereas steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) protein levels were unaffected. Our data indicate that 4-MBC affects development of male reproductive functions and organs, with a lowest observed adverse effect level of 0.7 mg/kg. Nuclear receptor coregulators were revealed as targets for endocrine disruptors, as shown for N-CoR in prostate and SRC-1 in uterus. This may have widespread effects on gene regulation.",PMC2174398

The prototypical EDC bisphenol A (BPA) is an estrogenic high-production chemical used primarily as a monomer for the production of polycarbonate and epoxy resins. It is now well established that there is ubiquitous human exposure to BPA. In the general population, exposure to BPA occurs mainly by consumption of contaminated foods and beverages that have contacted epoxy resins or polycarbonate plastics. To test the hypothesis that bioactive BPA was released from polycarbonate bottles used for consumption of water and other beverages, we evaluated whether BPA migrated into water stored in new or used high-quality polycarbonate bottles used by consumers. Using a sensitive and quantitative competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, BPA was found to migrate from polycarbonate water bottles at rates ranging from 0.20 ng/h to 0.79 ng/h. At room temperature the migration of BPA was independent of whether or not the bottle had been previously used. Exposure to boiling water (100 degrees C) increased the rate of BPA migration by up to 55-fold. The estrogenic bioactivity of the BPA-like immunoreactivity released into the water samples was confirmed using an in vitro assay of rapid estrogen signaling and neurotoxicity in developing cerebellar neurons. The amounts of BPA found to migrate from polycarbonate drinking bottles should be considered as a contributing source to the total ""EDC-burden"" to which some individuals are exposed.",PMC2254523

We sought to determine whether or not an environmental toxicant, DDE, or dietary derived endocrine disruptors, daidzein and genistein, are associated with spontaneous preterm labor. Cases were defined as primiparous patients having a preterm delivery at or before 35 weeks following the spontaneous onset of labor. Controls were defined as primiparous women who delivered on the same day as the cases but at term gestation. Over approximately 1 year, 26 cases and 52 controls were recruited. Subjects agreed to have blood tests on day one postpartum for DDE and for the phytoestrogens genistein and daidzein. The mean concentration of DDE was similar in the case and control groups: 4.29 vs 4.32 ng/g lipid p = .85. In the case group, 13/26 had detectable levels of daidzein (range 0.20 - 1.56 ng/ml) compared to 25/52 controls (range 0.21 - 3.26 ng/ml). The mean concentration of daidzein was similar in cases compared to controls: 0.30 vs .34 ng/ml p = 0.91.

There appears to be no relationship between serum concentrations of DDE, daidzein, and genistein and spontaneous preterm labor in our population.

MXC is a less-environmentally persistent analog of DDT that behaves as a weak estrogen. Using transient transfection assays in HepG2 cells, we have previously shown that each receptor is responsive to the endogenous ligand 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) in a dose-dependent manner. The parent compound, MXC, showed dose-dependent stimulation of transcriptional activation through all three ERs. In addition to the parent molecule, each of the metabolites was also estrogenic with all three ERs. The order of potency for ERalpha and ERbetab was HPTE>OH-MXC>MXC, while the opposite order was seen for ERbetaa. HepG2 cells did not substantially metabolize MXC to the active metabolites, thus the activity of MXC was not due to metabolism. When examining the effects of increasing concentrations of MXC at a fixed concentration of E(2), all three ERs show increased activity compared to that with E(2) alone, showing that the effects of MXC and E(2) are additive. However, when this experiment was repeated with increasing concentrations of HPTE at a fixed concentration of E(2), the activity of ERalpha was decreased, that of ERbetab was increased, while that of ERbetaa was unaffected compared to E(2) alone. These experiments suggest that HPTE functions as an E(2) antagonist with ERalpha, an E(2) agonist with ERbetab and does not perturb E(2) stimulation of ERbetaa. While it is clear the ERbeta subtypes are the products of different genes (due to a gene duplication in teleosts) the differences in their responses to MXC and its metabolites indicate that their functions diverge, both in their in vivo molecular response to E(2), as well as in their interaction with endocrine disrupting compounds found in the wild.",PMC2268757

In silico computational approaches were used to correlate candidate regulatory motifs with observed changes in gene expression. Our data suggest that TCDD inhibits follicle maturation via attenuated gonadotropin responsiveness and/or depressed estradiol biosynthesis, and that interference of estrogen-regulated signal transduction may also contribute to TCDD's impacts on follicular development. TCDD may also alter ovarian function by disrupting various signaling pathways such as glucose and lipid metabolism, and regulation of transcription. Furthermore, events downstream from initial TCDD molecular-targets likely contribute to ovarian toxicity following chronic exposure to TCDD.

Protocol sensitivity and reproducibility were tested using two androgen agonists (17alpha-methyl testosterone and 17beta-trenbolone), four antagonists [procymi-done, vinclozolin, linuron, and 1,1-dichoro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE)], and a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride). Sixteen laboratories from seven countries participated in phase 2. In 40 of 41 studies, the laboratories successfully detected substance-related weight changes in one or more tissues. The one exception was with the weakest antiandrogen, linuron, in a laboratory with reduced sensitivity because of high coefficients of variation in all tissue weights. The protocols performed well under different experimental conditions (e.g., strain, diet, housing protocol, bedding, vehicle). There was good agreement and reproducibility among laboratories with regard to the lowest dose inducing significant effects on tissue weights. The results show that the OECD Hershberger bioassay protocol is reproducible and transferable across laboratories with androgen agonists, weak androgen antagonists, and a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor.

Results from studies on PCBs and behavior have shown that exposure can alter learning and memory processes and that these shifts in cognitive abilities can be related to changes in hormonal and neural function. Little experimentation has been done on the impact of exposure to PCBs on social and emotional development. Previous work has shown that exposure to PCBs in children can alter play behavior. Importantly, exposure to PCBs has been found to change aspects of maternal-offspring interactions in rodents. The present study examined the impact of PCBs on maternal odor conditioning in rat pups 12-14 days of age. A modified version of the conditioned place preference paradigm was used that incorporated a maternal-associated odor cue (lemon scent) as the conditioned stimulus. PCBs significantly depressed the preference for the maternal-associated cue but did not impair discrimination for a novel odor. These effects could arise due to changes in the social dynamics between the dam and offspring after co-exposure to PCBs. For example, dams exposed to PCBs during gestation have been found to show elevated grooming directed towards pups exposed to PCBs. This change in maternal care can have dramatic effects on behavioral and hormonal systems in the developing rat pup.

We studied the effects of EDC on mammalian reproduction with an environmental-like protocol where the endpoint is the reproductive success of exposed pairs. We focused on a subclass of EDC, the xenoestrogens, which mimic the action of natural oestrogen hormones. Male and female rats were exposed to low doses of the pure oestrogen, ethynyloestradiol, during development, by oral administration to their mothers during pregnancy and lactation, and to them until puberty. We evaluated the effects of the exposure on development and reproductive physiology of individuals, and on fertility and fecundity of pairs in which both members had been exposed to the same treatment. We found that low doses caused major reproductive deficits in the experimental animals. Very low, environmentally relevant doses did not have evident effects on exposed animals; however, the fecundity of exposed pairs was substantially altered.

The observations suggest that the consequences of EDCs are not just transgenerational but can be ""transpopulational"", because in many mammalian species, males are the dispersing sex.

Some PCB mixtures can act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) by mimicking or antagonizing the actions of hormones in the brain and periphery. When exposure to hormonally active substances such as PCBs occurs during vulnerable developmental periods, particularly prenatally or in early postnatal life, they can disrupt sex-specific patterning of the brain, inducing permanent changes that can later be manifested as improper sexual behaviors. Here, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to the PCB mixture Aroclor (A) 1221 on adult female reproductive behaviors in a dose-response model in the Sprague-Dawley rat. Using a paced mating paradigm that permits the female to set the timing of mating and control contact with the male during copulation, we were able to uncover significant differences in female-typical sexual activities in A1221-exposed females. Specifically, A1221 causes significant effects on mating trial pacing, vocalizations, ambulation and the female's likelihood to mate. The results further demonstrate that the intermediate treatment group has the greatest number of disrupted endpoints, suggestive of non-linear dose responses to A1221.

A microarray technology is a very valuable method for the prediction of hormone-responsive activities in various gene expressions. Thus, we investigated the altered gene expression by estrogen and endocrine disruptors (EDs) using microarray technology in the uterus of immature rats. In this study, the expression levels of only 555 genes (7.42%) among the 7636 genes spotted on microarray chips were enhanced by more than two-fold following treatment with estradiol (E2), suggesting that direct or rapid response to E2 is widespread at the mRNA levels in these genes. In addition, elevated expression levels of the genes (over 2-fold) were observed by diethylstilbestrol (DES; 9.01%), octyl-phenol (OP; 8.81%), nonyl-phenol (NP; 9.51%), bisphenol-A (BPA; 8.26%) or genistein (9.97%) in the uterus of immature rats. The expression levels of representative genes, i.e., calbindin-D9k (CaBP-9k; vitamin D-dependent calcium-binding protein), oxytocin, adipocyte complement related protein (MW 30 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase A and calcium binding protein A6 (S100a6; calcyclin), were confirmed in these tissues by real-time PCR. In addition, the mRNA levels of these genes by real-time PCR were increased at follicular phase when E2 level was elevated during estrous cycle of adult female rats. In conclusion, these results indicate distinct altered expression of responsive genes following exposure to E2 and estrogenic compounds, and implicate distinct effects of endogenous E2 and environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals in the uterus of immature rats.",PMC1594574

Embryonic exposure to environmental compounds has been shown to promote various disease states or lesions in the first generation (F1). The current study used the endocrine disruptor vinclozolin (antiandrogenic compound) in a transient embryonic exposure at the time of gonadal sex determination in rats. Adult animals from the F1 generation and all subsequent generations examined (F1-F4) developed a number of disease states or tissue abnormalities including prostate disease, kidney disease, immune system abnormalities, testis abnormalities, and tumor development (e.g. breast). In addition, a number of blood abnormalities developed including hypercholesterolemia. The incidence or prevalence of these transgenerational disease states was high and consistent across all generations (F1-F4) and, based on data from a previous study, appears to be due in part to epigenetic alterations in the male germ line. The observations demonstrate that an environmental compound, endocrine disruptor, can induce transgenerational disease states or abnormalities, and this suggests a potential epigenetic etiology and molecular basis of adult onset disease.",PMC5940332

Subjects included 284 children with ASD and 657 controls, born in 1994 in the San Francisco Bay area. We assigned exposure level by census tract of birth residence for 19 chemicals we identified as potential neurotoxicants, developmental toxicants, and/or endocrine disruptors from the 1996 HAPs database. Because concentrations of many of these were highly correlated, we combined the chemicals into mechanistic and structural groups, calculating summary index scores. We calculated ASD risk in the upper quartiles of these group scores or individual chemical concentrations compared with below the median, adjusting for demographic factors. The adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were elevated by 50% in the top quartile of chlorinated solvents and heavy metals [95% confidence intervals (CIs) , 1.1-2.1], but not for aromatic solvents. Adjusting for these three groups simultaneously led to decreased risks for the solvents and increased risk for metals (AORs for metals: fourth quartile = 1.7 ; 95% CI, 1.0-3.0 ; third quartile = 1.95 ; 95% CI, 1.2-3.1) . The individual compounds that contributed most to these associations included mercury, cadmium, nickel, trichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride.

Several studies have indicated potential changes in hormone levels as well as declines in vertebrates with increasing dietary MeHg exposure. The purpose of this study was to identify alterations in gene expression associated with MeHg exposure, specifically those associated with previously observed changes in reproduction and reproductive biomarkers. Fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, were fed one of three diets that were similar to documented concentrations of MeHg in the diets of wild invertivorous and piscivorous fish. We used a commercial macroarray in conjunction with quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine gene expression in fish in relation to exposure to these environmentally relevant doses of MeHg. Expression of genes commonly associated with endocrine disruption was altered with Hg exposure. Specifically, we observed a marked up-regulation in vitellogenin mRNA in individual Hg-exposed males and a significant decline in vitellogenin gene expression in female fish with increasing Hg concentrations. Other genes identified by the macroarray experiment included those associated with egg fertilization and development, sugar metabolism, apoptosis, and electron transport. We also observed differences in expression patterns between male and female fish not related to genes specifically associated with reproduction, indicating a potential physiological difference in the reaction of males and females to MeHg. Gene expression data may provide insight into the mechanisms by which MeHg affects reproduction in fish and indicate how MeHg differs in its effect from other heavy metals and endocrine-disrupting compounds.",PMC1570078

16823090,Ian R Falconer,Are endocrine disrupting compounds a health risk in drinking water?,2006,"There has been a great deal of international discussion on the nature and relevance of endocrine disrupting compounds in the environment. Changes in reproductive organs of fish and mollusks have been demonstrated in rivers downstream of sewage discharges in Europe and in North America, which have been attributed to estrogenic compounds in the effluent. The anatomical and physiological changes in the fauna are illustrated by feminization of male gonads. The compounds of greatest hormonal activity in sewage effluent are the natural estrogens 17Beta-estradiol, estrone, estriol and the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol. Androgens are also widely present in wastewaters. Investigations of anthropogenic chemical contaminants in freshwaters and wastewaters have shown a wide variety of organic compounds, many of which have low levels of estrogenic activity. In many highly populated countries the drinking water is sourced from the same rivers and lakes that are the recipients of sewage and industrial discharge. The River Thames which flows through London, England, has overall passed through drinking water and sewage discharge 5 times from source to mouth of the river. Under these types of circumstance, any accumulation of endocrine disrupting compounds from sewage or industry potentially affects the quality of drinking water. Neither basic wastewater treatment nor basic drinking water treatment will eliminate the estrogens, androgens or detergent breakdown products from water, due to the chemical stability of the structures. Hence a potential risk to health exists; however present data indicate that estrogenic contamination of drinking water is very unlikely to result in physiologically detectable effects in consumers. Pesticide, detergent and industrial contamination remain issues of concern. As a result of this concern, increased attention is being given to enhanced wastewater treatment in locations where the effluent is directly or indirectly in use for drinking water. In some places at which heavy anthropogenic contamination of drinking water sources occurs, advanced drinking water treatment is increasingly being implemented. This treatment employs particle removal, ozone oxidation of organic material and activated charcoal adsorption of the oxidation products. Such processes will remove industrial organic chemicals, pesticides, detergents, pharmaceutical products and hormones. Populations for which only basic wastewater and drinking water treatment are available remain vulnerable.",PMC3807508

We sought to better understand the problem and investigated 171 male deer for phenotypic aberrations and 12 for detailed testicular histopathology. For the low-lying Aliulik Peninsula (AP), 61 of 94 deer were bilateral cryptorchids (BCOs); 70% of these had abnormal antlers. Elsewhere on the Kodiak Archipelago, only 5 of 65 deer were BCOs. All 11 abdominal testes examined had no spermatogenesis but contained abnormalities including carcinoma in situ-like cells, possible precursors of seminoma; Sertoli cell, Leydig cell, and stromal cell tumors; carcinoma and adenoma of rete testis; and microlithiasis or calcifications. Cysts also were evident within the excurrent ducts. Two of 10 scrotal testes contained similar abnormalities, although spermatogenesis was ongoing. We cannot rule out that these abnormalities are linked sequelae of a mutation(s) in a founder animal, followed by transmission over many years and causing high prevalence only on the AP. However, based on lesions observed, we hypothesize that it is more likely that this testis-antler dysgenesis resulted from continuing exposure of pregnant females to an estrogenic environmental agent(s), thereby transforming testicular cells, affecting development of primordial antler pedicles, and blocking transabdominal descent of fetal testes. A browse (e.g., kelp) favored by deer in this locale might carry the putative estrogenic agent(s).",PMC1874179

Pesticides are among a number of proposed causes for these declines. Although a sizable database examining effects of pesticides on amphibians exists, the vast majority of these studies focus on toxicological effects (lethality, external malformations, etc.) at relatively high doses (parts per million). Very few studies focus on effects such as endocrine disruption at low concentrations. Further, most studies examine exposures to single chemicals only. The present study examined nine pesticides (four herbicides, two fungicides, and three insecticides) used on cornfields in the midwestern United States. Effects of each pesticide alone (0.1 ppb) or in combination were examined. In addition, we also examined atrazine and S-metolachlor combined (0.1 or 10 ppb each) and the commercial formulation Bicep II Magnum, which contains both of these herbicides. These two pesticides were examined in combination because they are persistent throughout the year in the wild. We examined larval growth and development, sex differentiation, and immune function in leopard frogs (Rana pipiens). In a follow-up study, we also examined the effects of the nine-compound mixture on plasma corticosterone levels in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). Although some of the pesticides individually inhibited larval growth and development, the pesticide mixtures had much greater effects. Larval growth and development were retarded, but most significantly, pesticide mixtures negated or reversed the typically positive correlation between time to metamorphosis and size at metamorphosis observed in controls: exposed larvae that took longer to metamorphose were smaller than their counterparts that metamorphosed earlier. The nine-pesticide mixture also induced damage to the thymus, resulting in immunosuppression and contraction of flavobacterial meningitis. The study in X. laevis revealed that these adverse effects may be due to an increase in plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone. Although it cannot be determined whether all the pesticides in the mixture contribute to these adverse effects or whether some pesticides are effectors, some are enhancers, and some are neutral, the present study revealed that estimating ecological risk and the impact of pesticides on amphibians using studies that examine only single pesticides at high concentrations may lead to gross underestimations of the role of pesticides in amphibian declines.",PMC1874187

Gonadal abnormalities, including intersex, have also been recorded in these estuaries. However, there is no firm evidence to date that these two findings are causally linked or that the presence of estrogenic EDCs has any adverse population effects. In the present study, we examined the relationship between concentrations of VTG and sex steroids (11-oxo-testosterone in males and 17beta-estradiol in females) in specimens of flounder captured from the estuary of the River Mersey. We first questioned whether the high concentrations of VTG in male and immature female flounder were indeed caused by a direct effect of exogenous EDCs and not indirectly via the endogenous secretion of 17beta-estradiol. The data favored the direct involvement of estrogenic EDCs. We then questioned whether the presence of estrogenic EDCs not only stimulated inappropriate VTG synthesis but whether it might also have had a negative effect on endogenous steroid secretion. It should be noted that the predicted consequences of a drop in steroid secretion include smaller gonads, smaller oocytes, fewer numbers of sperm, and depressed spawning behavior. This question was more difficult to answer because of the strong effect of the seasonal reproductive cycle and stage of maturation on steroid concentrations. However, matched by month of capture and stage of maturation, both 17beta-estradiol in females and 11-keto-testosterone in males were in most cases significantly lower in those years when VTG concentrations were higher.",PMC1874175

Both pesticides also altered steady state mRNA expression levels of a set of genes chosen to represent three possible mechanisms of endocrine disruption: (1) direct interaction with soluble sex steroid receptors, (2) biosynthesis of endogenous sex hormones, and (3) metabolism of endogenous hormones. p,p'-DDE acted as a weak estrogen, increasing the expression of vitellogenin and estrogen receptor alpha in the liver. p,p'-DDE also altered the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of endogenous hormones as well as their metabolism. Dieldrin, on the other hand, only altered expression of vitellogenin and not estrogen receptor alpha.

For the Warsaw group a positive and negative correlation between XER and p,p'-DDE and estradiol equivalence level and CB-153 levels was found. No strong consistent association between xenoestrogenic net activity and the two POP markers was found. The results showed that the selected POP markers alone can not predict the integrated xenoestrogenic serum activity. Correlations to the POP markers were found at the extreme edge; the Inuit's and Warsaw study groups eliciting high frequency of samples with ER antagonistic and agonistic activity, respectively.

They have been recognized to have detrimental health effects both on wildlife and humans acting as endocrine disrupters due to their ability of mimicking the action of the steroid hormones, and thus interfering with hormone response. There are several experimental evidences that they bind and activate human steroid receptors. However, despite the growing concern about the toxicological activity of endocrine disrupters, molecular data of the interaction of these compounds with biological targets are still lacking. We have used a flexible docking approach to characterize the molecular interaction of seven endocrine disrupting chemicals with estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors in the ligand-binding domain. All ligands docked in the buried hydrophobic cavity corresponding to the hormone steroid pocket. The interaction was characterized by multiple hydrophobic contacts involving a different number of residues facing the binding pocket, depending on ligands orientation. The EDC ligands did not display a unique binding mode, probably due to their lipophilicity and flexibility, which conferred them a great adaptability into the hydrophobic and large binding pocket of steroid receptors. Our results are in agreement with toxicological data on binding and allow to describe a pattern of interactions for a group of ECD to steroid receptors suggesting the requirement of a hydrophobic cavity to accommodate these chlorine carrying compounds.

However, data on disruption of thyroid signaling are fragmentary, particularly at the molecular level. Thyroid hormone (TH; triiodothyronine, T3) acts principally by modulating transcription from target genes; thus, thyroid signaling is particularly amenable to analysis with a transcriptional assay. Also, T3 orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis, thereby providing an exceptional model for identifying thyroid-disrupting chemicals. We combined these two advantages to develop a method for following and quantifying the transcriptional action of T3 in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. This technology provides a means of assessing thyroid activity at the molecular level in a physiologically relevant situation. Moreover, translucent tadpoles are amenable to ""on-line"" imaging with fluorescent reporter constructs that facilitate in vivo measurement of transcriptional activity. We adapted transgenesis with TH-responsive elements coupled to either luciferase or green fluorescent protein to follow T3-dependent transcription in vivo. To reduce time of exposure and to synchronize responses, we optimized a physiologic pretreatment protocol that induced competence to respond to T3 and thus to assess T3 effects and T3 disruption within 48 hr. This pretreatment protocol was based on a short (24 hr), weak (10(-12) M) pulse of T3 that induced TH receptors, facilitating and synchronizing the transcriptional responses. This protocol was successfully applied to somatic and germinal transgenesis with both reporter systems. Finally, we show that the transcriptional assay allows detection of the thyroid-disrupting activity of environmentally relevant concentrations (10(-8) M) of acetochlor, a persistent herbicide.",PMC1310923

One concern about endocrine-disrupting xenobiotics is the potential for additive or synergistic (i.e., greater-than-additive) effects of mixtures. A short-term dosing model to examine the effects of environmental mixtures on thyroid homeostasis has been developed. Prototypic thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDCs) such as dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers have been shown to alter thyroid hormone homeostasis in this model primarily by up-regulating hepatic catabolism of thyroid hormones via at least two mechanisms. Our present effort tested the hypothesis that a mixture of TDCs will affect serum total thyroxine (T4) concentrations in a dose-additive manner. Young female Long-Evans rats were dosed via gavage with 18 different polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons [2 dioxins, 4 dibenzofurans, and 12 PCBs, including dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCBs] for 4 consecutive days. Serum total T4 was measured via radioimmunoassay in samples collected 24 hr after the last dose. Extensive dose-response functions (based on seven to nine doses per chemical) were determined for individual chemicals. A mixture was custom synthesized with the ratio of chemicals based on environmental concentrations. Serial dilutions of this mixture ranged from approximately background levels to 100-fold greater than background human daily intakes. Six serial dilutions of the mixture were tested in the same 4-day assay. Doses of individual chemicals that were associated with a 30% TH decrease from control (ED30), as well as predicted mixture outcomes were calculated using a flexible single-chemical-required method applicable to chemicals with differing dose thresholds and maximum-effect asymptotes. The single-chemical data were modeled without and with the mixture data to determine, respectively, the expected mixture response (the additivity model) and the experimentally observed mixture response (the empirical model). A likelihood-ratio test revealed statistically significant departure from dose additivity. There was no deviation from additivity at the lowest doses of the mixture, but there was a greater-than-additive effect at the three highest mixtures doses. At high doses the additivity model underpredicted the empirical effects by 2- to 3-fold.

In this study, we investigated feminized responses to two estrogenic WwTWs in roach exposed for periods during life stages of germ cell division (early life and the postspawning period). Roach were exposed as embryos from fertilization up to 300 days posthatch (dph; to include the period of gonadal sex differentiation) or as postspawning adult males, and including fish that had received previous estrogen exposure, for either 60 or 120 days when the annual event of germ cell proliferation occurs. Both effluents induced vitellogenin synthesis in both life stages studied, and the magnitude of the vitellogenic responses paralleled the effluent content of steroid estrogens. Feminization of the reproductive ducts occurred in male fish in a concentration-dependent manner when the exposure occurred during early life, but we found no effects on the reproductive ducts in adult males. Depuration studies (maintenance of fish in clean water after exposure to WwTW effluent) confirmed that the feminization of the reproductive duct was permanent. We found no evidence of ovotestis development in fish that had no previous estrogen exposure for any of the treatments. In wild adult roach that had previously received exposure to estrogen and were intersex, the degree of intersex increased during the study period, but this was not related to the immediate effluent exposure, suggesting a previously determined programming of ovotestis formation.",PMC1281270

This degranulation was blocked by BSA-conjugated progesterone (PROG-BSA) or 17beta-estradiol, both of which are antagonistic neurosteroids. 2 DHEAS-induced beta-HEX release was blocked by U-73122 or xestospongin C, but not by PTX or EGTA. DHEAS-induced beta-HEX release was also abolished by G(q/11)-AS, but not by G(q/11)-MS. Pharmacological analyses revealed that the neurosteroids stimulated a putative membrane receptor through activation of the novel G(q/11) and phospholipase C. 3 While representative endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) did not show any degranulation or nocifensive actions by themselves, they blocked the DHEAS-induced degranulation. 4 The binding of a PROG-BSA-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (PROG-BSA-FITC) to cells was inhibited by neurosteroids and EDCs. 5 In the algogenic-induced biting and licking responses test, DHEAS caused agonistic nocifensive actions in a dose-dependent manner between 1 and 10 fmol (i.pl.). DHEAS-induced nocifensive actions were abolished by PROG-BSA or nonylphenol. 6 Taken together, these results suggest that a G(q/11)-coupled neurosteroid receptor may regulate the neuroimmunological activity related to sensory stimulation and that some EDCs have antagonistic actions for this receptor.",PMC1576165

However, very few studies demonstrate the effects of estrogenic pollutants on brain function. We have used polyethylenimine-mediated in vivo somatic gene transfer to introduce an estrogen response element-thymidine kinase-luciferase (ERE-TK-LUC) construct into the brain. To determine if waterborne estrogenic chemicals modulate gene transcription in the brain, we injected the estrogen-sensitive construct into the brains of Nieuwkoop-Faber stage 54 Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Both ethinylestradiol (EE2; p < 0.002) and bisphenol A (BPA; p < 0.03) increased luciferase activity by 1.9- and 1.5-fold, respectively. In contrast, low physiologic levels of 17ss-estradiol had no effect (p > 0.05). The mixed antagonist/agonist tamoxifen was estrogenic in vivo and increased (p < 0.003) luciferase activity in the tadpole brain by 2.3-fold. There have been no previous reports of somatic gene transfer to the fish brain; therefore, it was necessary to optimize injection and transfection conditions for the adult goldfish (Carassius auratus). Following third brain ventricle injection of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-green fluorescent protein or CMV-LUC gene constructs, we established that cells in the telencephalon and optic tectum are transfected. Optimal transfections were achieved with 1 microg DNA complexed with 18 nmol 22 kDa polyethylenimine 4 days after brain injections. Exposure to EE2 increased brain luciferase activity by 2-fold in males (p < 0.05) but not in females.

The pharmaceutical ethynylestradiol (EE2) is a potent endocrine modulator and is present in the aquatic environment at biologically active concentrations. To investigate impacts on reproductive success and mechanisms of disruption, we exposed breeding populations (n = 12) of zebrafish (Danio rerio) over multiple generations to environmentally relevant concentrations of EE2. Life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 in the F1 generation caused a 56% reduction in fecundity and complete population failure with no fertilization. Conversely, the same level of exposure for up to 40 days in mature adults in the parental F0 generation had no impact on reproductive success. Infertility in the F1 generation after life-long exposure to 5 ng/L EE2 was due to disturbed sexual differentiation, with males having no functional testes and either undifferentiated or intersex gonads. These F1 males also showed a reduced vitellogenic response when compared with F0 males, indicating an acclimation to EE2 exposure. Depuration studies found only a partial recovery in reproductive capacity after 5 months. Significantly, even though the F1 males lacked functional testes, they showed male-pattern reproductive behavior, inducing the spawning act and competing with healthy males to disrupt fertilization. Endocrine disruption is therefore likely to affect breeding dynamics and reproductive success in group-spawning fish. Our findings raise major concerns about the population-level impacts for wildlife of long-term exposure to low concentrations of estrogenic endocrine disruptors.",PMC1253666

Phytoestrogens, including genistein, daidzein, and coumestrol, are fairly abundant in soybeans and alfalfa, common ingredients of laboratory animal diets. These compounds are weak agonists for the estrogen receptor (ER) and, when administered at sufficient doses, elicit an estrogenic response in vivo. In this study, we assessed the potential estrogenic effects of dietary phytoestrogens at the gene expression level, together with traditional biologic end points, using estrogen-responsive tissues of the immature female rat. We compared the gene expression profile of the uterus and ovaries, as a pool, obtained using a uterotrophic assay protocol, from intact prepubertal rats fed a casein-based diet (free from soy and alfalfa) or a regular rodent diet (Purina 5001) containing soy and alfalfa. Estrogenic potency of the phytoestrogen-containing diet was determined by analyzing uterine wet weight gain, luminal epithelial cell height, and gene expression profile in the uterus and ovaries. These were compared with the same parameters evaluated in animals exposed to a low dose of a potent ER agonist [0.1 microg/kg/day 17alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE) for 4 days]. Exposure to dietary phytoestrogens or to a low dose of EE did not advance vaginal opening, increase uterine wet weight, or increase luminal epithelial cell height in animals fed either diet. Although there are genes whose expression differs in animals fed the soy/alfalfa-based diet versus the casein diet, those genes are not associated with estrogenic stimulation. The expression of genes well known to be estrogen regulated, such as progesterone receptor, intestinal calcium-binding protein, and complement component 3, is not affected by consumption of the soy/alfalfa-based diet when assessed by microarray or quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Our results indicate that although diet composition has an impact on gene expression in uterus and ovaries, it does not contribute to the effects of an ER agonist.",PMC1247616

Neither BPA nor NP exposure affected behavioral characteristics in an open-field test (8 weeks of age), in a measurement of spontaneous motor activity (12 weeks of age), or in an elevated plus-maze test (14 weeks of age). A passive avoidance test (13 weeks of age) showed that both BPA- and NP-treated offspring tended to delay entry into a dark compartment. An active avoidance test at 15 weeks of age revealed that BPA-treated offspring showed significantly fewer avoidance responses and low-dose NP-treated offspring exhibited slightly fewer avoidance responses. Furthermore, BPA-treated offspring significantly increased the number of failures to avoid electrical unconditioned stimuli within 5-sec electrical shock presentation compared with the control offspring. In a monoamine-disruption test using 5 mg/kg (intraperitoneal) tranylcypromine (Tcy), a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, both BPA-treated and low-dose NP-treated offspring at 22-24 weeks of age failed to show a significant increment in locomotion in response to Tcy, whereas control and high-dose NP-treated offspring significantly increased locomotion behavior after Tcy injection. In addition, when only saline was injected during a monoamine-disruption test, low-dose NP-treated offspring showed frequent rearing compared with the control offspring.

Previous research has shown the mechanism of action for EDCs and phytoestrogens is as unintended ligands for the estrogen receptor (ER). Although pesticides have been synthesized to deter insects and weeds, plants produce phytoestrogens to deter herbivores, as attractant cues for insects, and as recruitment signals for symbiotic soil bacteria. Our data present the first evidence that some of the same organochlorine pesticides and EDCs known to disrupt endocrine signaling through ERs in exposed wildlife and humans also disrupt the phytoestrogen signaling that leguminous plants use to recruit Sinorhizobium meliloti soil bacteria for symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

We report here the prevalence of hypospadias from 1980 to 1999 in 20 regions of Europe with EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) population-based congenital anomaly registers, 14 of which implemented a guideline to exclude glanular hypospadias. We also report data from the England and Wales National Congenital Anomaly System (NCAS). Our results do not suggest a continuation of rising trends of hypospadias prevalence in Europe. However, a survey of the registers and a special validation study conducted for the years 1994-1996 in nine EUROCAT registers as well as NCAS identified a clear need for a change in the guidelines for registration of hypospadias. We recommend that all hypospadias be included in surveillance, but that information from surgeons be obtained to verify location of the meatus, and whether surgery was performed, in order to interpret trends. Investing resources in repeated special surveys may be more cost-effective than continuous population surveillance.

In 1999, samples from site 1 contained 9.6 pM R1881 equivalents and 1.7 pM 17beta-estradiol equivalents. Site 2 samples had estrogen levels similar to those in site 1 samples but lower androgen levels (3.8 pM R1881 equivalents). Androgen levels in site 3 samples were similar to those in site 2 samples, whereas estrogen levels decreased to 0.7 pM 17beta-estradiol equivalents. At site 6, androgen levels were approximately half those found at site 3, and estrogen levels were comparable with those at site 3. Sampling in later years was limited to fewer sites because of drought and lack of permission to access one site.

Our aims in this study were to devise robust methodologies suitable for extracting potential EDCs and to measure their summated effects on activities of androgen receptors (ARs) and estrogen receptors (ER-alpha and ER-beta) in marine samples from Singapore's coastal waters. In this study, we examined the ability of C18, hydrophilic and lipophilic balance, and diol cartridges to extract potential EDCs from seawater samples. Extracts from C18 cartridges exhibited the highest sex hormone bioactivities in reporter gene assays based on a human cell line expressing AR, ER-alpha, and ER-beta. Examination of extracts from 20 coastal locations showed high androgenic and estrogenic agonist activities in confined clusters closest to the main island of Singapore. Sex hormone activity declined rapidly in clusters farther from the main coastline and in more open waters. Unexpectedly, surface and mid-depth samples from the confined high-activity clusters, in the presence of hormone, exhibited AR and ER-alpha activities that were 200-900% higher than those observed for the cognate hormone alone. This enhanced sex hormone activity suggests that analyses of complex seawater mixtures may uncover unusual bioactivities that may not be obvious by studying individual compounds.

Using a stereologic approach, we found that Aroclor 1221 caused a highly significant down-regulation of the number of ER-ss-expressing cells in the AVPV, but had no effect in the SON.

Male fetuses exposed to antiandrogens during perinatal life are permanently demasculinized in their morphology and physiology, whereas exposure to exogenous androgens permanently masculinizes females. In some litter-bearing species, proximity(italic) in utero(/italic) of females to males can partially masculinize female siblings and alter their responsiveness to endocrine-disrupting compounds. However, in our strain of rat (CD-SD Charles River), intrauterine position does not significantly influence testosterone concentrations and anogenital distance of fetuses. In comparison, administration of testosterone propionate to pregnant females, at doses that doubled fetal female testosterone levels, did masculinize the reproductive system. Discovery of androgen-active chemicals in the environment has placed increased emphasis on describing the reproductive and behavioral effects of both natural and environmental androgens and antiandrogens. Recently, the effects of an antiandrogen, vinclozolin, on the brain and behavior were cited as a special concern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in its risk assessment of this pesticide. In rats, one such behavior that is perinatally organized by androgens is social play. Males play more than females, and administration of exogenous androgens during the neonatal period alters the juvenile expression of this sexually dimorphic behavior. Vinclozolin is an androgen receptor antagonist that inhibits androgen-dependent tissue growth in vivo. We were interested in whether developmental exposure to vinclozolin could also alter androgen-dependent behaviors such as play. Neonatal male rats were injected on postnatal days (PNDs) 2 and 3 with corn oil, the pharmacologic antiandrogen flutamide (50 mg/kg), or vinclozolin (200 mg/kg). On PNDs 36-37 animals were observed for social play. Behaviors associated with general social activity such as sniffing and dorsal contact were unaffected by treatment. However, play behavior in males treated with flutamide or vinclozolin was significantly reduced, resembling levels of play characteristic of females rather than untreated males. Therefore, this study demonstrates that perinatal exposure to vinclozolin, an environmental antiandrogen, can alter androgen-dependent play behavior in the male rat.",PMC1241195

One transcript [421 base pairs (bp)] regulated by OP and E(2) was 93% identical to human APLP-2. APLP-2 and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulate neuronal differentiation and are also implicated in the genesis of Alzheimer disease in humans. Northern blot analysis determined that the turtle hypothalamus contains a single APLP-2 transcript of 3.75 kb in length. Exposure to OP upregulated hypothalamic APLP-2 mRNA levels 2-fold (p < 0.05) in month-old and yearling turtles. E(2) did not affect APLP-2 mRNA levels in hatchlings but stimulated a 2-fold increase (p < 0.05) in APLP-2 mRNA levels in yearling males. The protein beta-amyloid, a selectively processed peptide derived from APP, is also involved in neuronal differentiation, and accumulation of this neurotoxic peptide causes neuronal degeneration in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease. Therefore, we also sought to determine the effects of estrogens on the expression of beta-amyloid. Using homology cloning based on known sequences, we isolated a cDNA fragment (474 bp) from turtle brain with 88% identity to human APP. Northern blot analysis determined that a single 3.5-kb transcript was expressed in the turtle hypothalamus. Waterborne OP also increased the expression of hypothalamic APP after 35 days of exposure. Our results indicate that low levels of OP are bioactive and can alter the expression of APLP-2 and APP. Because members of the APP gene family are involved in neuronal development, we hypothesize that OP exposure may disrupt hypothalamic development in young turtles.",PMC1240767

These chemicals, called ""endocrine-disrupting chemicals"" (EDCs), are such a scientific and public concern that screening and testing 58,000 chemicals for EDC activities is now statutorily mandated. Computational chemistry tools are important to biologists because they identify chemicals most important for in vitro and in vivo studies. Here we used a computational approach with integration of two rejection filters, a tree-based model, and three structural alerts to predict and prioritize estrogen receptor (ER) ligands. The models were developed using data for 232 structurally diverse chemicals (training set) with a 10(6) range of relative binding affinities (RBAs); we then validated the models by predicting ER RBAs for 463 chemicals that had ER activity data (testing set). The integrated model gave a lower false negative rate than any single component for both training and testing sets. When the integrated model was applied to approximately 58,000 potential EDCs, 80% (approximately 46,000 chemicals) were predicted to have negligible potential (log RBA < -4.5, with log RBA = 2.0 for estradiol) to bind ER. The ability to process large numbers of chemicals to predict inactivity for ER binding and to categorically prioritize the remainder provides one biologic measure to prioritize chemicals for entry into more expensive assays (most chemicals have no biologic data of any kind). The general approach for predicting ER binding reported here may be applied to other receptors and/or reversible binding mechanisms involved in endocrine disruption.",PMC1240690
11564618,"E Padilla-Banks, W N Jefferson, R R Newbold",The immature mouse is a suitable model for detection of estrogenicity in the uterotropic bioassay.,2001,"The traditional rodent uterotropic response assay has been incorporated into the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's screening and testing program for environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). While much effort continues to focus on determining protocol variables, few studies compare uterotropic responses in rats, a species commonly used in toxicologic testing, with other rodent species. In this study, we compared uterine responses in immature outbred CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. After three daily subcutaneous injections with 17beta-estradiol (0.1-500 microg/kg/day), immature mice and rats demonstrated a similar dose-response increase in absolute uterine wet weight and uterine weight:body weight ratio. Further, morphologic and biochemical parameters of estrogenicity, including uterine epithelial cell height and number, gland number, and induction of estrogen-responsive proteins lactoferrin and complement C3, mirror wet weight increases. We conclude that mice are as well suited as rats for the uterotropic bioassay. Because of the advantages of using mice, including lower costs, less space required, and smaller amounts of compound needed for tests, mice should be given appropriate consideration in testing paradigms for EDCs.",PMC1240410
11102301,"S A Sower, K L Reed, K J Babbitt",Limb malformations and abnormal sex hormone concentrations in frogs.,2000,"Declines in amphibian populations, and amphibians with gross malformations, have prompted concern regarding the biological status of many anuran species. A survey of bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana, and green frogs, Rana clamitans, conducted in central and southern New Hampshire showed malformed frogs at 81% of the sites sampled (13 of 16 sites). Brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and the synthesis of androgens and estradiol, hormones essential to reproductive processes, were measured from limb-malformed and normal (no limb malformation) frogs. Normal frogs had significantly higher concentrations (nearly 3-fold) of in vitro produced androgens and of brain GnRH than malformed frogs. Because most malformations are thought to occur during development, we propose that environmental factors or endocrine-disrupting chemicals that may cause developmental abnormalities also act during early development to ultimately cause abnormally reduced GnRH and androgen production in adult frogs. The consequences of reduced GnRH and androgens on anuran reproductive behavior and population dynamics are unknown but certainly may be profound and warrant further research.",PMC1240167

Puerto Rico has the highest known incidence of premature thelarche ever reported. In the last two decades since this serious public health anomaly has been observed, no explanation for this phenomenon has been found. Some organic pollutants, including pesticides and some plasticizers, can disrupt normal sexual development in wildlife, and many of these have been widely used in Puerto Rico. This investigation was designed to identify pollutants in the serum of Puerto Rican girls with premature thelarche. A method for blood serum analysis was optimized and validated using pesticides and phthalate esters as model compounds of endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Recovery was > 80% for all compounds. We performed final detection by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. We analyzed 41 serum samples from thelarche patients and 35 control samples. No pesticides or their metabolite residues were detected in the serum of the study or control subjects. Significantly high levels of phthalates [dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and di-(2-ethylhexyl)] and its major metabolite mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate were identified in 28 (68%) samples from thelarche patients. Of the control samples analyzed, only one showed significant levels of di-isooctyl phthalate. The phthalates that we identified have been classified as endocrine disruptors. This study suggests a possible association between plasticizers with known estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity and the cause of premature breast development in a human female population.",PMC2556932

In the current study we examine the effects of three endocrine-disrupting compounds, chlordane, trans-nonachlor, and the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Aroclor 1242, on the steroid hormone concentrations of red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings treated in ovo. Basal steroid concentrations and steroid concentrations in response to follicle-stimulating hormone were examined in both male and female turtles treated with each of the three compounds. Treated male turtles exposed to Aroclor 1242 or chlordane exhibited significantly lower testosterone concentrations than controls, whereas chlordane-treated females had significantly lower progesterone, testosterone, and 5[alpha]-dihydrotestosterone concentrations relative to controls. The effects of these endocrine disruptors extend beyond embryonic development, altering sex-steroid physiology in exposed animals.",PMC1638010

Data regarding the potential effects of endocrine-disrupting contaminants (EDCs) on reproductive function in amphibia are particularly lacking. We hypothesized that estrogenic EDCs may disrupt progesterone-induced oocyte maturation in the adult amphibian ovary, and tested this with an in vitro germinal vesicle breakdown assay using defolliculated oocytes from the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. While a variety of natural and synthetic estrogens and xenoestrogens were inactive in this system, the proestrogenic pesticide methoxychlor was a surprisingly potent inhibitor of progesterone-induced oocyte maturation (median inhibitive concentration, 72 nM). This inhibitory activity was specific to methoxychlor, rather than to its estrogenic contaminants or metabolites, and was not antagonized by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, suggesting that this activity is not estrogenic per se. The inhibitory activity of methoxychlor was dose dependent, reversible, and early acting. However, washout was unable to reverse the effect of short methoxychlor exposure, and methoxychlor did not competitively displace [3H]progesterone from a specific binding site in the oocyte plasma membrane. Therefore, methoxychlor may exert its action not directly at the site of progesterone action, but downstream on early events in maturational signaling, although the precise mechanism of action is unclear. The activity of methoxychlor in this system indicates that xenobiotics may exert endocrine-disrupting effects through interference with progestin-regulated processes and through mechanisms other than receptor antagonism.",PMC1566524
9721254,"R Bolger, T E Wiese, K Ervin, S Nestich, W Checovich",Rapid screening of environmental chemicals for estrogen receptor binding capacity.,1998,"Over the last few years, an increased awareness of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their potential to affect wildlife and humans has produced a demand for practical screening methods to identify endocrine activity in a wide range of environmental and industrial chemicals. While it is clear that in vivo methods will be required to identify adverse effects produced by these chemicals, in vitro assays can define particular mechanisms of action and have the potential to be employed as rapid and low-cost screens for use in large scale EDC screening programs. Traditional estrogen receptor (ER) binding assays are useful for characterizing a chemical's potential to be an estrogen-acting EDC, but they involve displacement of a radioactive ligand from crude receptor preparations at low temperatures. The usefulness of these assays for realistically determining the ER binding interactions of weakly estrogenic environmental and industrial compounds that have low aqueous solubility is unclear. In this report, we present a novel fluorescence polarization (FP) method that measures the capacity of a competitor chemical to displace a high affinity fluorescent ligand from purified, recombinant human ER-[alpha] at room temperature. The ER-[alpha] binding interactions generated for 15 natural and synthetic compounds were found to be similar to those determined with traditional receptor binding assays. We also discuss the potential to employ this FP technology to binding studies involving ER-ss and other receptors. Thus, the assay introduced in this study is a nonradioactive receptor binding method that shows promise as a high throughput screening method for large-scale testing of environmental and industrial chemicals for ER binding interactions.",PMC1533147
9703492,S H Safe,Hazard and risk assessment of chemical mixtures using the toxic equivalency factor approach.,1998,"There is considerable public, regulatory, and scientific concern regarding human exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which include compounds that directly modulate steroid hormone receptor pathways (estrogens, antiestrogens, androgens, antiandrogens) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds. Based on quantitative structure-activity relationships for both AhR and estrogen receptor (ER) agonists, the relative potency (RP) of individual compounds relative to a standard (e.g. TCDD and 17-beta-estradiol) have been determined for several receptor-mediated responses. Therefore, the TCDD or estrogenic equivalent (TEQ or EQ, respectively) of a mixture is defined as TEQ = sigma[T(i)]xRP(i)or EQ=sigma[E(i)]xRP(i), where T(i) and E(i) are concentrations of individual AhR or ER agonists in any mixture. This approach for risk assessment of endocrine-disrupting mixtures assumes that for each endocrine response pathway, the effects of individual compounds are essentially additive. This paper will critically examine the utility of the TEQ/EQ approach for risk assessment, the validity of the assumptions used for this approach, and the problems associated with comparing low dose exposures to xeno and natural (dietary) endocrine disruptors.",PMC1533329

The 1990s have witnessed a growing concern, both on the part of the scientific community and the public, that environmental chemicals may be causing widespread effects in humans and in a variety of fish and wildlife species. This growing concern led the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources (CENR) of the National Science and Technology Council to identify the endocrine disruptor issue as a major research initiative in early 1995 and subsequently establish an ad hoc Working Group on Endocrine Disruptors. The objectives of the working group are to 1) develop a planning framework for federal research related to human and ecological health effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals; 2) conduct an inventory of ongoing federal research programs; and 3) identify research gaps and develop a coordinated interagency plan to address priority research needs. This communication summarizes the activities of the federal government in defining a common framework for planning an endocrine disruptor research program and in assessing the status of the current effort. After developing the research framework and compiling an inventory of active research projects supported by the federal government in fiscal year 1996, the CENR working group evaluated the current federal effort by comparing the ongoing activities with the research needs identified in the framework. The analysis showed that the federal government supports considerable research on human health effects, ecological effects, and exposure assessment, with a predominance of activity occurring under human health effects. The analysis also indicates that studies on reproductive development and carcinogenesis are more prevalent than studies on neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity, that mammals (mostly laboratory animals) are the main species under study, and that chlorinated dibenzodioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls are the most commonly studied chemical classes. Comparison of the inventory with the research needs should allow identification of underrepresented research areas in need of attention.",PMC1533050

Increases in breast cancer incidence rates in Hawaii over the past few decades cannot be attributed solely to improvements in screening and detection. Avoidable environmental factors may contribute to a proportion of the unexplained cases. Emerging evidence on endocrine disruption suggests that environmental chemicals may play a role in the development of breast cancer. Agricultural chemicals, including endocrine disruptors, have been used intensively in Hawaii's island ecosystem over the past 40 years leaching into groundwater, and leading to unusually widespread occupational and general population exposures. This paper discusses breast cancer patterns in Hawaii in the context of documented episodes of exposure to two endocrine-disrupting chemicals, chlordane/heptachlor and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP), at levels that sometimes exceeded federal standards by several orders of magnitude.
