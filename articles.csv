38704805,"Christopher J Borgert, Lyle D Burgoon, John C Matthews",The physiological and biochemical basis of potency thresholds modeled using human estrogen receptor alpha: implications for identifying endocrine disruptors.,2024,"The endocrine system functions by interactions between ligands and receptors. Ligands exhibit potency for binding to and interacting with receptors. Potency is the product of affinity and efficacy. Potency and physiological concentration determine the ability of a ligand to produce physiological effects. The kinetic behavior of ligand-receptor interactions conforms to the laws of mass action. The laws of mass action define the relationship between the affinity of a ligand and the fraction of cognate receptors that it occupies at any physiological concentration. We previously identified the minimum ligand potency required to produce clinically observable estrogenic agonist effects via the human estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα). By examining data on botanical estrogens and dietary supplements, we demonstrated that ERα ligands with potency lower than one one-thousandth that of the primary endogenous hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) do not produce clinically observable estrogenic effects. This allowed us to propose a Human-Relevant Potency Threshold (HRPT) for ERα ligands of 1 × 10-4 relative to E2. Here, we test the hypothesis that the HRPT for ERα arises from the receptor occupancy by the normal metabolic milieu of endogenous ERα ligands. The metabolic milieu comprises precursors to hormones, metabolites of hormones, and other normal products of metabolism. We have calculated fractional receptor occupancies for ERα ligands with potencies below and above the previously established HRPT when normal circulating levels of some endogenous ERα ligands and E2 were also present. Fractional receptor occupancy calculations showed that individual ERα ligands with potencies more than tenfold higher than the HRPT can compete for occupancy at ERα against individual components of the endogenous metabolic milieu and against mixtures of those components at concentrations found naturally in human blood. Ligands with potencies less than tenfold higher than the HRPT were unable to compete successfully for ERα. These results show that the HRPT for ERα agonism (10-4 relative to E2) proposed previously is quite conservative and should be considered strong evidence against the potential for disruption of the estrogenic pathway. For chemicals with potency 10-3 of E2, the potential for estrogenic endocrine disruption must be considered equivocal and subject to the presence of corroborative evidence. Most importantly, this work demonstrates that the endogenous metabolic milieu is responsible for the observed ERα agonist HRPT, that this HRPT applies also to ERα antagonists, and it provides a compelling mechanistic explanation for the HRPT that is grounded in basic principles of molecular kinetics using well characterized properties and concentrations of endogenous components of normal metabolism.",PMC11106131

EDCs can activate or inhibit endogenous endocrine functions by binding hormone receptors, leading to potentially adverse effects. Conventional analytical methods can detect EDCs at a high sensitivity and precision, but are blind to the biological activity of the detected compounds. To overcome this limitation, yeast-based bioassays have previously been developed as a pre-screening method, providing an effect-based overview of hormonal-disruptive activity within the sample prior to the application of analytical methods. These yeast biosensors express human endocrine-specific receptors, co-transfected with the relevant response element fused to the specific fluorescent protein reporter gene. We describe several molecular manipulations of the sensor/reporter circuit in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae bioreporter strain that have yielded an enhanced detection of estrogenic-like compounds. Improved responses were displayed both in liquid culture (96-well plate format) as well as in conjunction with sample separation using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). The latter approach allows for an assessment of the biological effect of individual sample components without the need for their chemical identification at the screening stage.",PMC11048378

Numerous environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can impact related physiological activities through receptor signaling pathways. Focused on hERRγ with 4-isopropylphenol, bisphenol-F (BPF), and BP(2,2)(Un) complexes, we executed molecular docking and multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along with molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and solvation interaction energy (SIE) calculation to study the detailed dynamical structural characteristics and interactions between them. Molecular docking showed that hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were the prime interactions to keep the stability of BPF-hERRγ and hERRγ-BP(2,2)(Un) complexes. Through MD simulations, we observed that all complexes reach equilibrium during the initial 50 ns of simulation, but these three EDCs lead to local structure changes in hERRγ. Energy results further identified key residues L268, V313, L345, and F435 around the binding pockets through CH-π, π-π, and hydrogen bonds interactions play an important stabilizing role in the recognition with EDCs. And most noticeable of all, hydrophobic methoxide groups in BP(2,2)(Un) is useful for decreasing the binding ability between EDCs and hERRγ. These results may contribute to evaluate latent diseases associated with EDCs exposure at the micro level and find potential substitutes. Autodock4.2 was used to conduct the molecular docking, sietraj program was performed to calculate the energy, and VMD software was used to visualize the structure. Amber18 was conducted to perform the MD simulation and other analyses.",8217550

This study screened multiple PFAS in the rat uterotrophic assay to determine potential estrogenic effects on the uterus with PFAS exposure. This study also explored PFAS-dependent uterine signaling with an osmotic stress mRNA gene expression array. Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats (26-39 days old) were ovariectomized, and uterine tissue was allowed to regress for a 3-week period of recovery. Animals were then exposed daily via oral gavage to PFAS for 4 days, and then uterine weight was determined. In contrast to the positive control estrogens, the PFAS tested (4:2, 6:2, and 8:2FTOH; perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), nafion byproduct 2 (NBP2), 1H,1H,8H,8H-perfluorooctane-1,8-diol (FC8-diol) and 1H,1H,10H,10H-perfluorodecane-1,10-diol (FC10-diol)) caused no significant changes in the uterine weight. Hormonally active compounds can act as carcinogens, and because earlier rodent work has demonstrated that chronic PFOA exposure is associated with increased risk of uterine cancer, uterine mRNA gene expression was explored with an osmotic stress RT-qPCR array. PFAS exposure significantly upregulated multiple genes across the array, with PFOSA being the compound most similar to the reference estrogens (estradiol benzoate and ethinyl estradiol) in its expression pattern. Also, across all PFAS, pathway analysis revealed that the paxillin pathway, a pathway important in tumor suppressor gene SHP-2 signaling, was significantly upregulated with PFAS exposure. These results demonstrate that in vitro estrogen screens or impacts in fish may show different responses from direct impacts on mammalian uterine weight as assessed with the uterotrophic assay. This study also builds out new mechanisms that may contribute to understanding of carcinogenic changes seen in the uterus after PFAS exposure.",PMC10975357

Since 2009, it has been suggested that pharmaceuticals are emerging contaminants (called EDC), and recently, it was reported that most EDC are AR and MR antagonists and estrogen receptors (ER) agonists. Concerning SPI, endocrine-disrupting effects were observed in female western mosquitofish, but there are still no data regarding the SPI effects as a possible human EDC. In this work, aortic rings were used to analyze the contractility effects of SPI and the mode of action concerning the involvement of Ca2+ channels and endothelial pathways. Moreover, cytotoxic effects were analyzed by MTT assays. SPI induces vasodilation in the rat aorta by endothelium-dependent mechanisms involving NO and by endothelium-independent mechanisms blocking Ca2+ channels. Moreover, a non-monotonic effect characteristic of EDC was observed for SPI-induced decrease in cell viability. Our findings suggest that SPI may act as an EDC at a human level.

However, methods for their detection in environmental samples are cumbersome. We report a sensitive activity-based biosensor for rapid and reliable screening of progesterone receptor (PR)-interacting endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The biosensor is a cell line which expresses nuclear mCherry-NF1 and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged chimera of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) N terminus fused to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of PR (GFP-GR-PR). As this LBD is shared by the PRA and PRB, the biosensor reports on the activation of both PR isoforms. This GFP-GR-PR chimera is cytoplasmic in the absence of hormone and translocates rapidly to the nucleus in response to PR agonists or antagonists in concentration- and time-dependent manner. In live cells, presence of nuclear NF1 label eliminates cell fixation and nuclear staining resulting in efficient screening. The assay can be used in screens for novel PR ligands and PR-interacting contaminants in environmental samples. A limited screen of river water samples indicated a widespread, low-level contamination with PR-interacting contaminants in all tested samples.",PMC10917811

Despite their biological significance, GPCRs have not been widely studied in the field of toxicology. Herein, we investigated these receptors as novel targets of plastic chemicals using a high-throughput drug screening assay with 126 human non-olfactory GPCRs. In a first-pass screen, we tested the activity of triphenol phosphate, bisphenol A, and diethyl phthalate, as well as three real-world mixtures of chemicals extracted from plastic food packaging covering all major polymer types. We found 11 GPCR-chemical interactions, of which the chemical mixtures exhibited the most robust activity at adenosine receptor 1 (ADORA1) and melatonin receptor 1 (MTNR1A). We further confirm that polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane products contain ADORA1 or MTNRA1 agonists using a confirmatory secondary screen and pharmacological knockdown experiments. Finally, an analysis of the associated gene ontology terms suggests that ADORA1 and MTNR1A activation may be linked to downstream effects on circadian and metabolic processes. This work highlights that signaling disruption caused by plastic chemicals is broader than that previously believed and demonstrates the relevance of nongenomic pathways, which have, thus far, remained unexplored.",PMC10956435

PCBs are widely known to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and have been found to be involved in several diseases/disorders. This study takes various molecular descriptors of these PCBs (e.g., molecular weight) and toxicity endpoints as molecular activities, investigating the possibility of correlations via the quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR). This study then focuses on molecular docking and dynamics to investigate the docking behavior of the strongest-binding PCBs to nuclear receptors and compares these to the docking behavior of their natural ligands. Nuclear receptors are a family of transcription factors activated by steroid hormones, and they have been investigated to consider the impact of PCBs on humans in this context. It has been observed that the docking affinity of PCBs is comparable to that of the natural ligands, but they are inferior in terms of stability and interacting forces, as shown by the RMSD and total energy values. However, it is noted that most nuclear receptors respond to PCBs similarly to how they respond to their natural ligands-as shown in the RMSF plots-the most similar of which are seen in the ER, THR-β, and RAR-α. However, this study is performed purely in silico and will need experimental verification for validation.",PMC10821279

The model was used to accurately (Z' = 0.58-0.8) differentiate ERβ-selective ligands from ERα ligands when treated with a panel of selective agonists and antagonists. Next, we tested an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-provided set of 45 estrogenic reference chemicals with known ERα in vivo activity and identified several that activated ERβ as well, with varying sensitivity, including a subset that is completely novel. We then used an orthogonal ERE-containing transgenic zebrafish (ZF) model to cross validate ERβ and ERα selective activities at the organism level. Using this environmentally relevant ZF assay, some compounds were confirmed to have ERβ activity, validating the GFP-ERβ:PRL-HeLa assay as a screening tool for potential ERβ active endocrine disruptors (EDCs).

Such chemicals, termed endocrine disrupting chemicals, can promiscuously bind to different endocrine receptors and lead to varying biological end points. Thus, understanding the complexity of molecule-receptor binding of environmental chemicals can aid in the development of robust toxicity predictors. Toward this, the ToxCast project has generated the largest resource on the chemical-receptor activity data for environmental chemicals that were screened across various endocrine receptors. However, the heterogeneity in the multitarget structure-activity landscape of such chemicals is not yet explored. In this study, we systematically curated the chemicals targeting eight human endocrine receptors, their activity values, and biological end points from the ToxCast chemical library. We employed dual-activity difference and triple-activity difference maps to identify single-, dual-, and triple-target cliffs across different target combinations. We annotated the identified activity cliffs through the matched molecular pair (MMP)-based approach and observed that a small fraction of activity cliffs form MMPs. Further, we structurally classified the activity cliffs and observed that R-group cliffs form the highest fraction among the cliffs identified in various target combinations. Finally, we leveraged the mechanism of action (MOA) annotations to analyze structure-mechanism relationships and identified strong MOA-cliffs and weak MOA-cliffs, for each of the eight endocrine receptors. Overall, insights from this first study analyzing the structure-activity landscape of environmental chemicals targeting multiple human endocrine receptors will likely contribute toward the development of better toxicity prediction models for characterizing the human chemical exposome.",PMC10753715

Moreover, efficient and timely monitoring of vaccine efficacy is needed to prevent future widespread infections. Electrochemical immunosensing poses an effective alternative to conventional molecular spectroscopic approaches, offering rapid, cost-effective, sensitive, and portable electroanalysis of disease biomarkers and antibodies; however, efforts to improve binding efficiency and sensitivity are still being investigated. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) in particular have shown promise in improving device sensitivity. This study reports the development of a GQD-functionalized point-of-contamination device leveraging the selective interactions between SARS-CoV-2-specific Spike (S) Protein receptor binding domain (RBD) antigens and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific S-protein antibodies at screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) surfaces. The immunocomplexes formed at the GQD surfaces result in the interruption of the redox reactions that take place in the presence of a redox probe, decreasing the current response. Increased active surface area, conductivity, and binding via EDC/NHS chemistry were achieved due to the nanomaterial inclusion, with 5 nm, blue luminescent GQDs offering the best results. GQD concentration, EDC/NHS ratio, and RBD S-protein incubation time and concentration were optimized for the biosensor, and inter- and intra-screen-printed carbon electrode detection was investigated by calibration studies on multiple and single electrodes. The single electrode used for the entire calibration provided the best results. The label-free immunosensor was able to selectively detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies between 0.5 and 100 ng/mL in the presence of IgM and other coronavirus antibodies with an excellent regression of 0.9599. A LOD of 2.028 ng/mL was found, offering comparable findings to the literature-reported values. The detection sensitivity of the sensor is further compared to non-specific IgM antibodies. The developed GQD immunosensor was compared to other low-oxygen content carbon nanomaterials, namely (i) carbon quantum dot (CQD), (ii) electrochemically reduced graphene oxide, and (iii) carbon black-functionalized devices. The findings suggest that improved electron transfer kinetics and increased active surface area of the CNs, along with surface oxygen content, aid in the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies.

BPA exposure causes hormonal disruption and alters mitochondrial dynamics and activity, ultimately leading to decreased male fertility. As public health concerns following BPA exposure are rising globally, there is a need to understand the exact mechanisms of BPA on various diseases. BPA exposure causes hormonal imbalances and affects male fertility by binding the estrogen receptors (ERs), but the mechanism of how it mediates the hormonal dysregulation is yet to be studied. This study consisted of a comparative study using mice that were separated into a control group and a group exposed to the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) (n = 20 mice/group) after a week of acclimatization to the environment. For this study, the LOAEL established by the US Environmental Protection Agency of 50 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day of BPA was used. The control mice were given corn oil orally. Based on the daily variations in BW, both groups were gavaged every day from 6 to 11 weeks (6-week exposure). Before sampling, mice were stabilized for a week. Then, the testes and spermatozoa of each mouse were collected to investigate the effects of BPA on male fertility. IVF was carried out using the cumulus-oocyte complexes from female hybrid B6D2F1/CrljOri mice (n = 3) between the ages of eight and twelve weeks. Signaling pathways, apoptosis, and mitochondrial activity/dynamics-related proteins were evaluated by western blotting. ELISA was performed to determine the levels of sex hormones (FSH, LH, and testosterone) in serum. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to determine the effects of BPA on histological morphology and stage VII/VIII testicular seminiferous epithelium. Blastocyst formation and cleavage development rate were evaluated using IVF. BPA acted by binding to ERs and G protein-coupled receptors and activating the protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, leading to aberrant hormone levels and effects on the respiratory chain complex, ATP synthase and protein-related apoptotic pathways in testis mitochondria (P < 0.05). Subsequently, embryo cleavage and blastocyst formation were reduced after the use of affected sperm, and abnormal morphology of seminiferous tubules and stage VII and VIII seminiferous epithelial cells (P < 0.05) was observed. It is noteworthy that histopathological lesions were detected in the testes at the LOAEL dose, even though the mice remained generally healthy and did not exhibit significant changes in BW following BPA exposure. These observations suggest that testicular toxicity is more than a secondary outcome of compromised overall health in the mice due to systemic effects. Not applicable. Since the protein expression levels in the testes were validated, in vitro studies in each testicular cell type (Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and spermatogonial stem cells) would be required to shed further light on the exact mechanism resulting from BPA exposure. Furthermore, the BPA doses employed in this study significantly exceed the typical human exposure levels in real-life scenarios. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct experiments focusing on the effects of BPA concentrations more in line with daily human exposures to comprehensively assess their impact on testicular toxicity and mitochondrial activity. These findings demonstrate that BPA exposure impacts male fertility by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics and activities in the testes and provides a solid foundation for subsequent investigations into the effects on male reproductive function and fertility following BPA exposure, and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects. In addition, these findings suggest that the LOAEL concentration of BPA demonstrates exceptional toxicity, especially when considering its specific impact on the testes and its adverse consequences for male fertility by impairing mitochondrial activity. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that BPA elicits distinct toxicological responses and mechanistic endpoints based on the particular concentration levels for each target organ.

In vitro methods included receptor-binding, CALUX transactivation, H295R steroidogenesis, aromatase activity inhibition and the Yeast oestrogen (YES) and Yeast androgen screen (YAS) assays. The impact of metabolism was also evaluated. The YES/YAS assays exhibited a high sensitivity for ER effects and, despite some challenges in predicting AR effects, is a good initial screening assay. Results from receptor-binding and CALUX assays generally correlated and were in accordance with classifications based on ToxCast assays. ER agonism and AR antagonism of benzyl butyl phthalate were abolished when CALUX assays included liver S9. In silico final calls were mostly in agreement with the in vitro assays, and predicted ER and AR effects well. The efficiency of the in silico models (reflecting applicability domains or inconclusive results) was 43-100%. The percentage of correct calls for ER (50-100%), AR (57-100%) and aromatase (33-100%) effects when compared to the final ToxCast call covered a wide range from highly reliable to less reliable models.

Hence, several such chemicals have been screened for their adverse physiological effects in human cell lines via high-throughput assays in the ToxCast project. The invaluable data generated by the ToxCast project has enabled the development of toxicity predictors, but they can be limited in their predictive ability due to the heterogeneity in structure-activity relationships among chemicals.

EDCs are metabolized through hepatic enzymes, causing altered transcriptional activities of hormone receptors, and thus necessitating the exploration of the potential endocrine-disrupting activities of EDC-derived metabolites. Accordingly, we have developed an integrative workflow for evaluating the post-metabolic activity of potential hazardous compounds. The system facilitates the identification of metabolites that exert hormonal disruption through the integrative application of an MS/MS similarity network and predictive biotransformation based on known hepatic enzymatic reactions. As proof-of-concept, the transcriptional activities of 13 chemicals were evaluated by applying the in vitro metabolic module (S9 fraction). Identified among the tested chemicals were three thyroid hormone receptor (THR) agonistic compounds that showed increased transcriptional activities after phase I+II reactions (T3, 309.1 ± 17.3%; DITPA, 30.7 ± 1.8%; GC-1, 160.6 ± 8.6% to the corresponding parents). The metabolic profiles of these three compounds showed common biotransformation patterns, particularly in the phase II reactions (glucuronide conjugation, sulfation, GSH conjugation, and amino acid conjugation). Data-dependent exploration based on molecular network analysis of T3 profiles revealed that lipids and lipid-like molecules were the most enriched biotransformants. The subsequent subnetwork analysis proposed 14 additional features, including T4 in addition to 9 metabolized compounds that were annotated by prediction system based on possible hepatic enzymatic reaction. The other 10 THR agonistic negative compounds showed unique biotransformation patterns according to structural commonality, which corresponded to previous in vivo studies.

We developed six models that predict the binding of a compound to ARs, ERα, or ERβ as agonists or antagonists, using counter-propagation artificial neural networks (CPANN). Models were trained on a dataset of structurally diverse compounds, and activity data were obtained from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard. Leave-one-out (LOO) tests were performed to validate the models. The results showed that the models had excellent performance with prediction accuracy ranging from 94% to 100%.

Using substances from the original OECD validation study, we obtained lowest observed effect concentrations for steroidogenesis mostly equivalent to those previously reported and sometimes lower for estrogen biosynthesis. However, categorization of many of these substances as receptor (ant)agonists or disruptors of steroidogenesis was difficult because often substances had both modalities, including some where the receptor-mediated activities were identified at concentrations below those triggering steroidogenic effects. When the leading activity was not accounted for, H295R-CALUX assay sensitivity in comparison to the OECD validation study was 0.50 for androgen and 0.78 for estrogen biosynthesis. However, upon reinterpretation of the combined assay results to identify endocrine activities without regard to the modality or direction of effects, assay sensitivity was equal to 1.00. These proof-of-concept study findings indicate the high relevance of this assay for the identification of endocrine active substances with additional valuable mode-of-action information and the capacity to detect smaller changes in estrogen biosynthesis, suggesting that the coupled H295R-CALUX assay has promise for the analysis of samples in a decision-making context.",PMC10375316

Approximately 15% of couples suffer from infertility globally, with a male factor contribution of approximately 50%. However, male infertility remains largely unexplored, as the burden of infertility is mostly assigned to female people. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been proposed as one of the factors causing male infertility. Pyrethroids represent an important class of EDCs, and numerous studies have associated pyrethroid exposure with impaired male reproductive function and development. Therefore, the present study investigated the potentially toxic effects of two common pyrethroids, cypermethrin and deltamethrin, on androgen receptor (AR) signaling. The structural binding characterization of cypermethrin and deltamethrin against the AR ligand-binding pocket was performed using Schrodinger's induced fit docking (IFD) approach. Various parameters were estimated, such as binding interactions, binding energy, docking score, and IFD score. Furthermore, the AR native ligand, testosterone, was subjected to similar experiments against the AR ligand-binding pocket. The results revealed commonality in the amino acid-binding interactions and overlap in other structural parameters between the AR native ligand, testosterone, and the ligands, cypermethrin and deltamethrin. The estimated binding energy values of cypermethrin and deltamethrin were very high and close to those calculated for AR native ligand, testosterone. Taken together, the results of this study suggested potential disruption of AR signaling by cypermethrin and deltamethrin, which may result in androgen dysfunction and subsequent male infertility.",PMC10175798
37175656,Ahmad Besaratinia,The State of Research and Weight of Evidence on the Epigenetic Effects of Bisphenol A.,2023,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high-production-volume chemical with numerous industrial and consumer applications. BPA is extensively used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. The widespread utilities of BPA include its use as internal coating for food and beverage cans, bottles, and food-packaging materials, and as a building block for countless goods of common use. BPA can be released into the environment and enter the human body at any stage during its production, or in the process of manufacture, use, or disposal of materials made from this chemical. While the general population is predominantly exposed to BPA through contaminated food and drinking water, non-dietary exposures through the respiratory system, integumentary system, and vertical transmission, as well as other routes of exposure, also exist. BPA is often classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical as it can act as a xenoestrogen. Exposure to BPA has been associated with developmental, reproductive, cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, or immune effects, as well as oncogenic effects. BPA can disrupt the synthesis or clearance of hormones by binding and interfering with biological receptors. BPA can also interact with key transcription factors to modulate regulation of gene expression. Over the past 17 years, an epigenetic mechanism of action for BPA has emerged. This article summarizes the current state of research on the epigenetic effects of BPA by analyzing the findings from various studies in model systems and human populations. It evaluates the weight of evidence on the ability of BPA to alter the epigenome, while also discussing the direction of future research.",PMC10178030

It is, however, known to cause more damaging health effects compared to other e-EDCs. Environmental water systems are commonly contaminated with E2 that originates from domestic effluents. The determination of the level of E2 is thus very crucial in both wastewater treatment and in the aspect of environmental pollution management. In this work, an inherent and strong affinity of the estrogen receptor-α (ER-α) for E2 was used as a basis for the development of a biosensor that was highly selective towards E2 determination. A gold disk electrode (AuE) was functionalised with a 3-mercaptopropionic acid-capped tin selenide (SnSe-3MPA) quantum dot to produce a SnSe-3MPA/AuE electroactive sensor platform. The ER-α-based biosensor (ER-α/SnSe-3MPA/AuE) for E2 was produced by the amide chemistry of carboxyl functional groups of SnSe-3MPA quantum dots and the primary amines of ER-α. The ER-α/SnSe-3MPA/AuE receptor-based biosensor exhibited a formal potential (E0') value of 217 ± 12 mV, assigned as the redox potential for monitoring the E2 response using square-wave voltammetry (SWV). The response parameters of the receptor-based biosensor for E2 include a dynamic linear range (DLR) value of 1.0-8.0 nM (R2 = 0.99), a limit of detection (LOD) value of 1.69 nM (S/N = 3), and a sensitivity of 0.04 µA/nM.

TBT promotes adipogenic commitment and differentiation of MSCs in vitro. To identify TBT-induced factors predisposing MSCs toward the adipocytic fate, we exposed mouse MSCs to TBT, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-selective agonist rosiglitazone, or the retinoid X receptor (RXR)-selective agonist LG-100268. Then we determined their transcriptomal profiles to determine candidate microRNAs (miR) regulating adipogenic commitment and differentiation. Of the top 10 candidate microRNAs predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, miR-21, miR-33, and miR-223 were expressed consistent with an ability to differentially regulate target genes during adipogenesis. We found that 24-hour exposure to 50nM TBT caused miR-223 levels in MSCs to increase; expression of its target genes ZEB1, NFIB, and FOXP1 was decreased. Rosiglitazone and TBT increased miR-223 levels. This induction was inhibited by the PPARγ antagonist T0070907 but not by the RXR antagonists HX531 or UVI3003, placing miR-223 downstream of PPARγ. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed TBT-induced binding of PPARγ to regulatory elements in the miR-223 promoter. miR-223 levels were elevated in white adipose tissue of F2 and F3 male descendants of pregnant F0 mouse dams exposed to 50nM TBT throughout gestation. miR-223 levels were potentiated in males fed an increased fat diet. We infer that TBT induced miR-223 expression and increased adipogenesis in MSCs through the PPARγ pathway and that transgenerationally increased expression of miR-223 plays an important role in the development of obesity caused by TBT exposure.",PMC10282922

There is mounting evidence linking exposure to MDCs to increased susceptibility to diabetes. Despite the important role of glucagon in glucose homeostasis, there is little information on the effects of MDCs on α-cells. Furthermore, there are no methods to identify and test MDCs with the potential to alter α-cell viability and function. Here, we used the mouse α-cell line αTC1-9 to evaluate the effects of MDCs on cell viability and glucagon secretion. We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 µM): bisphenol-A (BPA), tributyltin (TBT), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), triphenylphosphate (TPP), triclosan (TCS), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). Using two different approaches, MTT assay and DNA-binding dyes, we observed that BPA and TBT decreased α-cell viability via a mechanism that depends on the activation of estrogen receptors and PPARγ, respectively. These two chemicals induced ROS production, but barely altered the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. Although PFOA, TPP, TCS, and DDE did not alter cell viability nor induced ROS generation or ER stress, all four compounds negatively affected glucagon secretion. Our findings suggest that αTC1-9 cells seem to be an appropriate model to test chemicals with metabolism-disrupting activity and that the improvement of the test methods proposed herein could be incorporated into protocols for the screening of diabetogenic MDCs.",PMC9820113

After demonstrating that this model expresses all the TAS2Rs (TAS2R3, TAS2R4, TAS2R14, TAS2R19, TAS2R43) specifically expressed by the primary human granulosa cells, we demonstrated that BCA and caffeine significantly affect mitochondrial footprint and intracellular lipid content, indicating their contribution in steroidogenesis.

FcγRIa has the highest affinity toward IgG1-type monoclonal antibodies among all FcγRs. In this study, a comprehensive characterization was performed for FcγRIa as a potential affinity ligand for IgG1-type monoclonal antibody binding. The binding interactions were assessed with the SPR technique using different immobilization techniques such as EDC-NHS coupling, streptavidin-biotin interaction, and His-tagged FcγRIa capture. The His-tagged FcγRIa capture was the most convenient method based on assay repeatability. Next, a crude IgG1 sample and its fractions with different monomer contents obtained from protein A affinity chromatography were used to evaluate FcγRIa protein in terms of monoclonal antibody binding capacity. The samples were also compared with a protein A-immobilized chip (a frequently used affinity ligand) for IgG1 binding responses. The antibody binding capacity of the protein A-immobilized chip surface was significantly better than that of the FcγRIa-immobilized chip surface due to its 5 Ig binding domains. The antibody binding responses changed similarly with protein A depending on the monomer content of the sample. Finally, a different configuration was used to assess the binding affinity of free FcγRs (FcγRIa, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIIa) to three different immobilized IgGs by immobilizing protein L to the chip surface. Unlike previous immobilization techniques tested where the FcγRIa was utilized as a ligand, nonimmobilized or free FcγRIa resulted in a significantly higher antibody binding response than free protein A. In this configuration, kinetics data of FcγRI revealed that the association rate (ka 50-80 × 105 M-1 s-1) increased in comparison to His capture method (1.9-2.4 × 105 M-1 s-1). In addition, the dissociation rate (kd 10-5 s-1) seemed slower over the His capture method (10-4 s-1) and provided stability on the chip surface during the dissociation phase. The KD values for FcγRIa were found in the picomolar range (2.1-10.33 pM from steady-state affinity analysis and 37.5-46.2 pM from kinetic analysis) for IgG1-type antibodies. FcγRIa possesses comparable ligand potential as well as protein A. Even though the protein A-immobilized surface bound more antibodies than the FcγRIa-captured surface, FcγRIa presented a significant antibody binding capacity in protein L configuration. The results suggest FcγRIa protein as a potential ligand for site-oriented immobilization of IgG1-type monoclonal antibodies, and it needs further performance investigation on different surfaces and interfaces for applications such as sensing and antibody purification.",PMC9730901

In view of this, we investigated the possible presence of (anti)androgenic contaminants in raw and commercialized milk samples. For this purpose, a novel HepARE-Luc cell line that stably expresses human androgen receptor (AR) and the androgen responsive luciferase reporter gene was generated and used in the present study. Treatment of this cell line with androgens and corresponding antiandrogen (flutamide) stimulated or inhibited expression of reporter luciferase, respectively. Real time polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining results exhibited transcription response and translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to androgen. Observations implied that a cell-based xenobiotic screening assay via AR response can be conducted for assessing the (anti)androgenic ligands present in food chain including milk. Therefore, the cell line was further used to screen the (anti)androgenic activity of a total of 40 milk fat samples procured as raw or commercial milk. Some of the raw and commercial milk fat samples distinctly showed antiandrogenic activities. Subsequently, some commonly used environmental chemicals were also evaluated for their (anti)androgenic activities. Initial observations with molecular docking studies of experimental compounds were performed to assess their interaction with AR ligand binding domain. Furthermore, (anti)androgenic activities of these compounds were confirmed by performing luciferase assay using the HepARE-Luc cell line. None of the test compounds showed androgenic activities rather some of them like Bisphenol A (BPA) and rifamycin showed antiandrogenic activities. In conclusion, our results provide a valuable information about the assessment of (anti)androgenic activities present in milk samples. Overall, it is proposed that a robust cell-based CALUX assay can be used to assess the (anti)androgenic activities present in milk which can be attributed to different environmental chemicals present therein.",PMC9670299

Pullulan (Pull) was linked to stearic acid (SA) after functional group modifications via EDC/NHS chemistry and characterized. Sorafenib tosylate (SRFT) was entrapped in pullulan-stearic acid nanoparticles (Pull-SA-SRFT) and its particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), loading capacity (LC), and release efficiency was measured. The competence of Pull-SA-SRFT over SRFT in vitro was assessed using the ASGPR over-expressing PLC/PRF/5 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line. This was done by studying cytotoxicity by MTT assay and chromosome condensation assay, early apoptosis by annexin-Pi staining, and late apoptosis by live-dead assay. The cellular uptake study was performed by incorporating coumarin-6 (C6) fluorophore in place of SRFT in Pull-SA conjugates. A biodistribution study was conducted in Swiss-albino mice to assess the biocompatibility and targeting properties of SRFT and Pull-SA-SRFT to the liver and other organs at 1, 6, 24, and 48 h. The characterization studies of the copolymer confirmed the successful conjugation of Pull-SA. The self-assembled amphiphilic nanocarrier could proficiently entrap the hydrophobic drug SRFT to obtain an entrapment efficiency of 95.6% (Pull-SA-SRFT). Characterization of the synthesized nanoparticles exhibited highly desirable nanoparticle characteristics. In vitro, apoptotic studies urged that Pull-SA-SRFT nanoparticle was delivered more efficiently to HCC than SRFT. The cellular uptake study performed, gave propitious results in 4 hrs. The biodistribution study conducted in immunocompetent mice suggested that Pull-SA-SRFT was delivered more than SRFT to the liver when compared to other organs, and that the system was biocompatible.

The US (United States) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has run two programs, the Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Project (CERAPP) and the Collaborative Modeling Project for Receptor Activity (CoMPARA) which aim to predict estrogen and androgen activity, respectively. The US EPA solicited research groups from around the world to provide endocrine receptor activity Qualitative (or Quantitative) Structure Activity Relationship ([Q]SAR) models and then combined them to create consensus models for different toxicity endpoints. Random Forest (RF) models were developed to cover a broader range of substances with high predictive capabilities using large datasets from CERAPP and CoMPARA for estrogen and androgen activity, respectively. By utilizing simple descriptors from open-source software and large training datasets, RF models were created to expand the domain of applicability for predicting endocrine disrupting activity and help in the screening and prioritization of extensive chemical inventories. In addition, RFs were trained to conservatively predict the activity, meaning models are more likely to make false-positive predictions to minimize the number of False Negatives.

Bell-shaped CRCs are about 7 times more frequent than U-shaped ones in the Tox21 ER assays. Many compounds exhibit NMDR in at least one assay, and some EDCs well-known for their NMDRs in the literature were also identified, suggesting their nonmonotonic effects may originate at cellular levels involving transcriptional ER signaling.

NAD+ is an important coenzyme involved in several metabolic pathways and is a required cofactor for the function of sirtuins (SIRTs) and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerases. Declines in NAD+ levels are associated with metabolic and inflammatory diseases, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. To inhibit CD38 enzyme activity and boost NAD+ levels, we developed TNB-738, an anti-CD38 biparatopic antibody that pairs two non-competing heavy chain-only antibodies in a bispecific format. By simultaneously binding two distinct epitopes on CD38, TNB-738 potently inhibited its enzymatic activity, which in turn boosted intracellular NAD+ levels and SIRT activities. Due to its silenced IgG4 Fc, TNB-738 did not deplete CD38-expressing cells, in contrast to the clinically available anti-CD38 antibodies, daratumumab, and isatuximab.

The possible direct interaction of PFAS with TSH-receptor (TSH-R) was investigated by computer-based molecular docking and analysis of molecular dynamics. Evaluation of intracellular cAMP levels and gene expression analysis were used to validate the direct impairment of TSH-R-mediated downstream events upon PFAS exposure. Different from PFOS or C6O4, exposure to PFOA at a concentration ≥ 10 ng/mL was associated with significant impairment of the iodide uptake upon TSH stimulation (respectively: basal 100.0 ± 19.0%, CTRL + TSH 188.9 ± 7.8%, PFOA 10 ng/mL + TSH 120.4 ± 20.9%, p= 0.030 vs CTRL + TSH; PFOA 100 ng/mL + TSH 115,6 ± 12,3% p= 0.017 vs CTRL + TSH). No impairment of cell viability or membrane stability was observed. Computational analysis showed a possible direct differential interaction of C6O4, PFOA, and PFOS on a same binding site of the extracellular domain of TSH-R. Finally, exposure to PFOA was associated with a significant reduction of downstream intracellular cAMP levels and both sodium-iodide transporter and thyroperoxidase gene expression upon TSH-R stimulation. Our data suggest that legacy and new generation PFAS can differentially influence TSH dependent signaling pathways through the direct interaction with TSH-R.",PMC9259843

These EDCs can disrupt hormone signaling in the human and animal body systems including the very important hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis causing adverse health effects. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are hormones of the HPT axis which are essential for regulation of metabolism, heart rate, body temperature, growth, development, etc. In this study, potential endocrine-disrupting activity of the most common phthalate plasticizer, DEHP, and emerging non-phthalate alternate plasticizers, DINCH, ATBC, and DEHA against thyroid hormone receptor (TRα) were characterized. The structural binding characterization of indicated ligands was performed against the TRα ligand binding site employing Schrodinger's induced fit docking (IFD) approach. The molecular simulations of interactions of the ligands against the residues lining a TRα binding pocket, including bonding interactions, binding energy, docking score, and IFD score were analyzed. In addition, the structural binding characterization of TRα native ligand, T3, was also done for comparative analysis. The results revealed that all ligands were placed stably in the TRα ligand-binding pocket. The binding energy values were highest for DINCH, followed by ATBC, and were higher than the values estimated for TRα native ligand, T3, whereas the values for DEHA and DEHP were similar and comparable to that of T3. This study suggested that all the indicated plasticizers have the potential for thyroid hormone disruption with two alternate plasticizers, DINCH and ATBC, exhibiting higher potential for thyroid dysfunction compared to DEHA and DEHP.",PMC9145736

This study reports the synthesis of bifunctional folic-conjugated aspartic-modified Fe3O4 nanocarriers with an excellent ability to deliver doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer drug, into the intercellular matrix. Here, the presence of amine and carboxylate groups enables aspartic acid (AA) to be used as an efficient anchoring molecule for the conjugation of folic acid (FA) (EDC-NHS coupling) and DOX (electrostatic interaction). Based on the results, surface functionalization showed little effect on the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles but significantly influenced both the loading and release efficiency of DOX. This is primarily caused by the steric hindrance effect due to large and bulky FA molecules. Furthermore, in vitro MTT assay of B16-F1 cell lines revealed that FA conjugation was responsible for a significant increase in the cytotoxicity of DOX-loaded nanocarriers, which was also found to be proportional to AA concentration. This high cytotoxicity resulted from an efficient cellular uptake induced by the over-expressed folate receptors and fast pH triggered DOX release inside the target cell. Here, the lowest IC50 value of DOX-loaded nanocarriers was achieved at 2.814 ± 0.449 μg mL-1. Besides, further investigation also showed that the drug-loaded nanocarriers exhibited less or no toxicity against normal cells.",PMC8981417

Identifying chemicals that can act as EDCs and modulate the function of NRs is difficult because of the time and cost of in vitro and in vivo screening to determine the potential hazards of the 100 000s of chemicals that humans are exposed to. Hence, there is a need for computational approaches to prioritize chemicals for biological testing. Machine learning (ML) techniques are alternative methods that can quickly screen millions of chemicals and identify those that may be an EDC. Computational models of chemical binding to multiple NRs have begun to emerge. Recently, a Nuclear Receptor Activity (NuRA) dataset, describing experimentally derived small-molecule activity against various NRs has been created. We have used the NuRA dataset to develop an ensemble of ML-based models to predict the agonism, antagonism, binding and effector binding of small molecules to nine different human NRs. We defined the applicability domain of the ML models as a measure of Tanimoto similarity to the molecules in the training set, which enhanced the performance of the developed classifiers. We further developed a user-friendly web server named 'NR-ToxPred' to predict the binding of chemicals to the nine NRs using the best-performing models for each receptor. This web server is freely accessible at http://nr-toxpred.cchem.berkeley.edu.

Due to their effects on the endocrine system, some pesticides are classified as endocrine disruptors. The aim of the study is to assess the interference of five pesticides on estrogen biosynthesis and estrogen signaling. Three neonicotinoid insecticides (Acetamiprid, Clothianidin, and Thiamethoxam), a carbamate insecticide (Methiocarb) and a herbicide (Oxadiazon) were tested. The effect of pesticides on estrogen biosynthesis was studied through an ELISA assay using a recombinant form of human aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of androgens to estrogens. Moreover, the effect of pesticides on estrogen signaling was assessed using a gene reporter assay on MELN cells, which measures estrogen receptor-mediated estrogenic activity. The results of the ELISA assay showed that the pesticides did not alter aromatase activity (no interference with estrogen biosynthesis), while the results of the gene reporter assay showed that only Methiocarb was able to alter estrogen signaling at high doses. The estrogenic activity of Methiocarb, expressed as 17β-estradiol equivalency factor (EEF), was equal to 8.0 × 10-8. In conclusion, this study suggested that Methiocarb should be considered a potential endocrine disruptor.",PMC8871760

Preclinical evidence suggests that exposure to EDCs is associated with the development of major depressive disorder (MDD) and could result in neural degeneration. The interaction of EDCs with hormonal receptors is the best-described mechanism of their biological activity. However, the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal adrenal axis has been reported and linked to neurological disorders. At a worldwide level and in Mexico, the incidence of MDD has recently been increasing. Of note, in Mexico, there are no clinical associations on blood levels of EDCs and the incidence of the MDD. Methodology: Thus, we quantified for the first time the serum levels of parent compounds of two bisphenols and four phthalates in patients with MDD. The levels of di-ethyl-hexyl-phthalate (DEHP), butyl-benzyl-phthalate (BBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), and di-ethyl-phthalate (DEP), bisphenol A (BPA), and bisphenol S (BPS) in men and women with or without MDD were determined with a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. Results/conclusion: We found significant differences between concentrations of BBP between controls and patients with MDD. Interestingly, the serum levels of this compound have a dysmorphic behavior, being much higher in women (~500 ng/mL) than in men (≤10 ng/mL). We did not observe significant changes in the serum concentrations of the other phthalates or bisphenols tested, neither when comparing healthy and sick subjects nor when they were compared by gender.

The present research aimed to evaluate the differences in oxysterols levels following exposure to two metabolism disrupting chemicals (propylparaben (PP) and triclocarban (TCC)) in the zebrafish model using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Following exposure to PP and TCC, there were no significant changes in total and individual oxysterols compared with the control group; however, some interesting differences were noticed: 24-OH was detected only in treated zebrafish embryos, as well as the concentrations of 27-OH, which followed a different distribution, with an increase in TCC treated embryos and a reduction in zebrafish embryos exposed to PP at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf).

While a few legacy PFASs have been voluntarily phased out, over 5000 PFASs have been produced as replacements for their predecessors. The potential endocrine disrupting hazards of most emerging PFASs have not been comprehensively investigated. In silico molecular docking to the human androgen receptor (hAR) combined with machine learning techniques were previously applied to 5206 PFASs and predicted 23 PFASs bind the hAR. Herein, the in silico results were validated in vitro for the five candidate AR ligands that were commercially available. Three manufactured PFASs namely (9-(nonafluorobutyl)- 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1 H,5 H,11 H-pyrano[2,3-f]pyrido[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-11-one (NON), 2-(heptafluoropropyl)- 3-phenylquinoxaline (HEP), and 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoro-N-(4-nitrophenyl)pentanamide (NNN) elicited significant antiandrogenic effects at relatively low concentrations. We further investigated the mechanism of AR inhibition and found that all three PFASs inhibited AR transactivation induced by testosterone through a competitive binding mechanism. We then examined the antiandrogenic effects of these PFASs on AR expression and its responsive genes. Consistently, these PFASs significantly decreased the expression of PSA and FKBP5 and increased the expression of AR, similar to the effects elicited by a known competitive AR inhibitor, hydroxyflutamide. This suggests they are competitive antagonists of AR activity and western blot analysis revealed these PFASs decreased intracellular AR protein in androgen sensitive human prostate cancer cells. Hence, the findings presented here corroborate our published in silico approach and indicate these emerging PFASs may adversely affect the human endocrine system.",PMC9705075

It is an alternative to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a well-known reprotoxic and endocrine disruptor. As plasticizers are known to easily migrate when in contact with fatty biological fluids, patient exposure to TEHTM is highly probable. However, there is currently no data on the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of its human metabolites. To evaluate the effects of TEHTM metabolites on endocrine activity, they were first synthesized and their effects on estrogen, androgen and thyroid receptors, as well as steroid synthesis, were investigated by combining in vitro and in silico approaches. Among the primary metabolites, only 4-MEHTM (4-mono-(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate) showed agonist activities on ERs and TRs, while three diesters were TR antagonists at non-cytotoxic concentrations. These results were completed by docking experiments which specified the ER and TR isoforms involved. A mixture of 2/1-MEHTM significantly increased the estradiol level and reduced the testosterone level in H295R cell culture supernatants. The oxidized secondary metabolites of TEHTM had no effect on ER, AR, TR receptors or on steroid hormone synthesis. Among the fourteen metabolites, these data showed that two of them (4-MEHTM and 2/1-MEHTM) induced effect on hormonal activities in vitro. However, by comparing the concentrations of the primary metabolites found in human urine with the active concentrations determined in bioassays, it can be suggested that the metabolites will not be active with regard to estrogen, androgen, thyroid receptors and steroidogenesis-mediated effects.",7916494

Previous studies on prenatal exposure to Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in mice and humans demonstrated pubertal timing and reproductive performance could be affected in exposed offspring. However, the impacts at the pituitary, specifically regarding signaling pathways engaged and direct effects on the gonadotropins LH and FSH, are unknown. We hypothesized prenatal exposure to DEHP during a critical period of embryonic development (e15.5 to e18.5) will cause sex-specific disruptions in reproduction-related mRNA expression in offspring's pituitary due to interference with androgen and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling. We found that prenatal DEHP exposure in vivo caused a significant increase in Fshb specifically in males, while the anti-androgen flutamide caused significant increases in both Lhb and Fshb in males. AhR target gene Cyp1b1 was increased in both sexes in DEHP-exposed offspring. In embryonic pituitary cultures, the DEHP metabolite MEHP increased Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 mRNA in both sexes and Cyp1b1 induction was reduced by co-treatment with AhR antagonist. AhR reporter assay in GHFT1 cells confirmed MEHP can activate AhR signaling. Lhb, Fshb and Gnrhr mRNA were significantly decreased in both sexes by MEHP, but co-treatment with AhR antagonist did not restore mRNA levels in pituitary culture. In summary, our data suggest phthalates can directly affect the function of the pituitary by activating AhR signaling and altering gonadotropin expression. This indicates DEHP's impacts on the pituitary could contribute to reproductive dysfunctions observed in exposed mice and humans.",PMC8882145

We have previously demonstrated that RACK1 expression can serve as a marker for evaluation of immunotoxic profiles of hormone-active substances, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In this study, we investigated the effects of three bisphenols (BPA, BPAF, BPS) on RACK1 expression and on the innate immune responses in the THP-1 human promyelocytic cell line, a validated model for this investigation. BPA and BPAF reduced RACK1 promoter transcriptional activity, mRNA expression, and protein levels. However, BPS had the opposite effect. As expected, these results on RACK1 were paralleled by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) production. Since BPA and BPAF induced RACK1 expression in the presence of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone, a role of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has been considered due to their known estrogenic profile. Therefore, additional molecular effects of BPA and BPAF were unmasked after treatment with different inhibitors of well-known pivotal players of GPER-mediated signaling. BPA exerted its effects on RACK1 via NF-κB, as shown using the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7085 and NF-κB-specific luciferase reporter assay. Conversely, BPAF induced RACK1 up-regulation via androgen receptor (AR) activation, as confirmed by treatment with AR antagonist flutamide. Indeed, a biased agonism profile for BPA and BPAF for GPER was suggested based on their different binding modes revealed by our molecular docking.

EDCs are easily absorbed into the body and have the ability to mimic or block hormone function. The radioligand binding assay based on the estrogen receptors binding affinity is widely used to detect estrogenic EDCs but is limited to radioactive substances and requires specific conditions. As an alternative, we developed a human cell-based dimerization assay for detecting EDC-mediated ER-alpha (ERα) dimerization using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). The resultant novel BRET-based on the ERα dimerization assay was used to identify the binding affinity of 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-estradiol, corticosterone, diethylhexyl phthalate, bisphenol A, and 4-nonylphenol with ERα by measuring the corresponding BRET signals. Consequently, the BRET signals from five chemicals except corticosterone showed a dose-dependent sigmoidal curve for ERα, and these chemicals were suggested as positive chemicals for ERα. In contrast, corticosterone, which induced a BRET signal comparable to that of the vehicle control, was suggested as a negative chemical for ERα. Therefore, these results were consistent with the results of the existing binding assay for ERα and suggested that a novel BRET system can provide information about EDCs-mediated dimerization to ERα.",PMC8395052

Increases in endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have attracted attention in recent years, due to their liver function-inhibiting abilities. Exposure to EDCs can induce nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which are major etiologies of LMTs, through interaction with nuclear receptors (NR) and stress response pathways (SRs). Therefore, exposure to potential EDC drugs could be associated with drug-induced LMTs. However, the drug classes associated with LMTs and the molecular initiating events (MIEs) that are specific to these drugs are not well understood. In this study, using the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, we detected LMT-inducing drug signals based on adjusted odds ratios. Furthermore, based on the hypothesis that drug-induced LMTs are triggered by NR and SR modulation of potential EDCs, we used the quantitative structure-activity relationship platform for toxicity prediction to identify potential MIEs that are specific to LMT-inducing drug classes. Events related to cell proliferation and apoptosis, DNA damage, and lipid accumulation were identified as potential MIEs, and their relevance to LMTs was supported by the literature.

Pyrethroids are insecticide chemicals that are extensively used for crop protection and household purposes but have been identified as EDCs. On account of their ubiquitous environmental presence, human exposure occurs via food, dermal, or inhalation routes and is associated with health problems, including reproductive dysfunction. Permethrin is the most commonly used pyrethroid, and with two chiral centers in its structure, it has four stereoisomeric forms (two enantiomer pairs), i.e., permethrin (1R,3R)-cis, permethrin (1R,3S)-trans, permethrin (1S,3S)-cis, and permethrin (1S,3R)-trans. The current study was performed for predicting the potential endocrine-disrupting activity of the aforementioned four stereoisomers of permethrin against the androgen receptor (AR). The structural binding characterization and binding energy estimations in the AR binding pocket were done using induced fit docking. The structural binding data indicated that all stereoisomers were placed stably in the AR binding pocket and that the estimated binding energy values were comparable to the AR native ligand, except for permethrin (1S,3S)-cis. Furthermore, the commonality in the amino acid interactions to that of the AR native ligand and the binding energy values suggested the potential AR-disrupting activity of all the stereoisomers; however, stereoselective differences were not observed. Taken together, the results suggest that human exposure to permethrin, either as a racemate mixture or in individual stereoisomer form, could potentially interfere with AR function, which may lead to male reproductive dysfunction.",PMC7918290

In addition, in vitro reporter gene assays (RGAs) using Esr1 and ARβ of Japanese medaka were performed for the 16 chemicals, to support the interpretation of the in vivo effects observed in the FSTRA. In the present study, all the test chemicals, except an antiandrogenic chemical and a weak Esr agonist, significantly reduced the reproductive status of the test fish, that is, fecundity or fertility, at concentrations where no overt toxicity was observed. Moreover, vitellogenin (VTG) induction in males and formation of secondary sex characteristics (SSC), papillary processes on the anal fin, in females was sensitive endpoints to Esr and AR agonistic effects, respectively, and might be indicators of the effect concentrations in long-term exposure.

Estrone (E1), a natural steroid, is found in aquatic environments sometimes at high concentrations relative to the estrogenic steroids 17β-estradiol (E2) and 17α-ethynylestradiol. However, E1 has been less thoroughly studied than E2 or 17α-ethynylestradiol due in part to a relatively lower potency in metabolically limited estrogen receptor (ER) binding/activation assays. Recent evidence suggests that in vivo biotransformation of E1 to E2 may occur in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) residing in environments with high concentrations of E1, such as near wastewater treatment plants. The enzymes likely responsible for this biotransformation, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17βHSDs), have been well characterized in mammals but to a lesser extent in fish species. In the present study, a novel systematic analysis of amino acid sequence data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database demonstrated that multiple 17βHSD isoforms are conserved across different fish species. Experimentally, we showed that metabolically active hepatic cytosolic preparations from 2 commercially important salmonid species, rainbow trout and lake trout, biotransformed E1 to E2 to a degree sufficient to alter results of competitive ER binding assays.

In this study, the approach using AF4 is evaluated for the antibody trastuzumab in buffer and serum. The particular object of this study was to test the feasibility of using AF4 in combination with SPR to detect and quantify proteins and aggregates in complex samples such as blood serum. Also, in the investigation, three different immobilisation methods for the receptor HER-2 were compared, which involved (1) direct binding via EDC/NHS, the standard approach; (2) immobilisation via NTA-Ni-Histag complexation; and (3) biotin/avidin-linked chemistry using a regenerable form of avidin. The highest specific activity was obtained for the biotin-avidin method, while the lowest specific activity was observed for the NTA-Ni-Histag linkage.

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is the predominant form in human samples and has been shown to induce severe health consequences, such as neonatal mortality, neurotoxicity, and immunotoxicity. Toxicological studies indicate that PFAS accumulate in bone tissues and cause altered bone development. Epidemiological studies have reported an inverse relationship between PFAS and bone health, however the associated mechanisms are still unexplored. Here, we present computational, in silico and in vitro evidence supporting the interference of PFOA on vitamin D (VD). First, PFOA competes with calcitriol on the same binding site of the VD receptor, leading to an alteration of the structural flexibility and a 10% reduction by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Second, this interference leads to an altered response of VD-responsive genes in two cellular targets of this hormone, osteoblasts and epithelial cells of the colorectal tract. Third, mineralization in human osteoblasts is reduced upon coincubation of PFOA with VD. Finally, in a small cohort of young healthy men, PTH levels were higher in the exposed group, but VD levels were comparable. Altogether these results provide the first evidence of endocrine disruption by PFOA on VD pathway by competition on its receptor and subsequent inhibition of VD-responsive genes in target cells.",PMC7545187

A potential limitation to the use of in vitro assay data in regulatory decision-making is the lack of coverage for xenobiotic metabolic processes. Both hepatic- and peripheral-tissue metabolism can yield metabolites that exhibit greater activity than the parent compound (bioactivation) or are inactive (bioinactivation) for a given biological target. Interpretation of biological effect data for both putative endocrine active substances, as well as other chemicals, screened in HTS assays may benefit from the addition of xenobiotic metabolic capabilities to decrease the uncertainty in predicting potential hazards to human health. The objective of this study was to develop an approach to retrofit existing HTS assays with hepatic metabolism. The Alginate Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) platform encapsulates hepatic S9 fractions in alginate microspheres attached to 96-well peg lids. Functional characterization across a panel of reference substrates for phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed substrate depletion with expected metabolite accumulation. Performance of the AIME method in the VM7Luc estrogen receptor transactivation assay was evaluated across 15 reference chemicals and 48 test chemicals that yield metabolites previously identified as estrogen receptor active or inactive. The results demonstrate the utility of applying the AIME method for identification of false-positive and false-negative target assay effects, reprioritization of hazard based on metabolism-dependent bioactivity, and enhanced in vivo concordance with the rodent uterotrophic bioassay. Integration of the AIME metabolism method may prove useful for future biochemical and cell-based HTS applications.",PMC8154005

Of the thousands of chemicals present in the environment, those with adverse effects on the endocrine system are referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Here, we focused on a subclass of EDCs that impacts the estrogen receptor (ER), a pivotal transcriptional regulator in health and disease. Estrogenic activity of compounds can be measured by many in vitro or cell-based high throughput assays that record various endpoints from large pools of cells, and increasingly at the single-cell level. To simultaneously capture multiple mechanistic ER endpoints in individual cells that are affected by EDCs, we previously developed a sensitive high throughput/high content imaging assay that is based upon a stable cell line harboring a visible multicopy ER responsive transcription unit and expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of ER. High content analysis generates voluminous multiplex data comprised of minable features that describe numerous mechanistic endpoints. In this study, we present a machine learning pipeline for rapid, accurate, and sensitive assessment of the endocrine-disrupting potential of benchmark chemicals based on data generated from high content analysis. The multidimensional imaging data was used to train a classification model to ultimately predict the impact of unknown compounds on the ER, either as agonists or antagonists. To this end, both linear logistic regression and nonlinear Random Forest classifiers were benchmarked and evaluated for predicting the estrogenic activity of unknown compounds. Furthermore, through feature selection, data visualization, and model discrimination, the most informative features were identified for the classification of ER agonists/antagonists. The results of this data-driven study showed that highly accurate and generalized classification models with a minimum number of features can be constructed without loss of generality, where these machine learning models serve as a means for rapid mechanistic/phenotypic evaluation of the estrogenic potential of many chemicals.",PMC7538107

Xenobiotics binding to NRs may disrupt natural hormonal systems and induce undesired adverse effects in the body. However, many chemicals of concerns have limited or no experimental data on their potential or lack-of-potential endocrine-disrupting effects. Here, we propose a virtual screening method based on molecular docking for predicting potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that bind to NRs. For 12 NRs, we systematically analyzed how multiple crystal structures can be used to distinguish actives and inactives found in previous high-throughput experiments. Our method is based on (i) consensus docking scores from multiple structures at a single functional state (agonist-bound or antagonist-bound), (ii) multiple functional states (agonist-bound and antagonist-bound), and (iii) multiple pockets (orthosteric site and alternative sites) of these NRs. We found that the consensus enrichment from multiple structures is better than or comparable to the best enrichment from a single structure. The discriminating power of this consensus strategy was further enhanced by a chemical similarity-weighted scoring scheme, yielding better or comparable enrichment for all studied NRs. Applying this optimized method, we screened 252 fatty acids against peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and successfully identified 3 previously unknown fatty acids with Kd = 100-250 μM including two furan fatty acids: furannonanoic acid (FNA) and furanundecanoic acid (FUA), and one cyclopropane fatty acid: phytomonic acid (PTA).

Traditional experimental testing regimens to identify toxicants that induce endocrine disruption can be expensive and time-consuming. Computational modeling has emerged as a promising and cost-effective alternative method for screening and prioritizing potentially endocrine-active compounds. The efficient identification of suitable chemical descriptors and machine-learning algorithms, including deep learning, is a considerable challenge for computational toxicology studies. Here, we sought to apply classic machine-learning algorithms and deep-learning approaches to a panel of over 7500 compounds tested against 18 Toxicity Forecaster assays related to nuclear estrogen receptor (ERα and ERβ) activity. Three binary fingerprints (Extended Connectivity FingerPrints, Functional Connectivity FingerPrints, and Molecular ACCess System) were used as chemical descriptors in this study. Each descriptor was combined with four machine-learning and two deep- learning (normal and multitask neural networks) approaches to construct models for all 18 ER assays. The resulting model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver- operating curve (AUC) values obtained from a fivefold cross-validation procedure. The results showed that individual models have AUC values that range from 0.56 to 0.86. External validation was conducted using two additional sets of compounds (n = 592 and n = 966) with established interactions with nuclear ER demonstrated through experimentation. An agonist, antagonist, or binding score was determined for each compound by averaging its predicted probabilities in relevant assay models as an external validation, yielding AUC values ranging from 0.63 to 0.91.

In this study, three pesticides, glyphosate, thiacloprid, and imidacloprid, were tested for their ability to interfere with estrogen biosynthesis and/or signaling, to evaluate their potential action as EDCs. Among the tested compounds, only glyphosate inhibited aromatase activity (up to 30%) via a non-competitive inhibition or a mixed inhibition mechanism depending on the concentration applied. Then, the ability of the three pesticides to induce an estrogenic activity was tested in MELN cells.

Molecular dynamics and docking simulations predicted the potential binding sites and the binding mode of the three pesticides on the structure of the two key targets, providing a rational for their mechanism as EDCs.

AR, a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, is the central regulator of male reproduction and is involved in many pathophysiological processes. AR protein levels and nuclear localization often increase following ligand binding, with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) being the natural agonist.

Analysis of numerous biological replicates led to a quality control metric that takes into account the distribution of single-cell data, and how it changes upon treatments. Dose-response experiments across several cell lines showed a large range of sensitivity to DHT, prompting us to treat selected cell lines with 45 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-provided chemicals that include many endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs); data from six of the compounds were then integrated with orthogonal assays.

EPA models have incorporated our high-content analysis-based green fluorescent protein estrogen receptor (GFP-ER): PRL-HeLa assay, which allows direct visualization of ER binding to DNA regulatory elements. Here, we characterize a modified functional assay based on the stable expression of a chimeric androgen receptor (ARER), wherein a region containing the native AR DNA-binding domain (DBD) was replaced with the ERα DBD (amino acids 183-254). We demonstrate that the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone induces GFP-ARER nuclear translocation, PRL promoter binding, and transcriptional activity at physiologically relevant concentrations (<1 nM). In contrast, the AR antagonist bicalutamide induces only nuclear translocation of the GFP-ARER receptor (at μM concentrations). Estradiol also fails to induce visible chromatin binding, indicating androgen specificity. In a screen of reference chemicals from the EPA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the GFP-ARER cell model identified and mechanistically grouped activity by known (anti-)androgens based on the ability to induce nuclear translocation and/or chromatin binding.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers were used as the major FR until 2004, when they were replaced by organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs). Previous research in rodent models utilizing a commercial flame retardant mixture containing OPFRs reported alterations in anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) for rodents perinatally exposed to OPFRs. In the present study we utilize wild-type mice maternally exposed (gestational day 7 to postnatal day 14) to either an OPFR mixture of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl), triphenyl phosphate, and tricresyl phosphate or a sesame seed oil vehicle. These mice were evaluated for anxiety-like behavior in adulthood on the open field test (OFT) and the light/dark box (LDB) as well as the EPM. Outcomes from the OFT and LDB indicate that males and females maternally exposed to OPFRs exhibit altered locomotor activity. Results of the EPM were sex-specific as we did not observe an effect in females; however, effects in males differed depending on exposure condition. Males maternally exposed to OPFRs exhibited an anxiolytic-like phenotype in contrast to their vehicle counterparts.

Extracts from selected strains were tested repeatedly in the estrogen-responsive RGAs, but the observed estrogen agonist and antagonist activity was minor and similar to that of the cyanobacteria growth medium control.

Perinatal exposure of BPA could induce longitudinal alteration of DNA hydroxymethylation in imprinted loci of mouse blood cells. To date, no data has been reported on the effects of BPA on DNA hydroxymethylation in breast cells. Therefore, we asked whether BPA can induce DNA hydroxymethylation change in human breast cells. Given that dysregulated epigenetic DNA hydroxymethylation is observed in various cancers, we wondered how DNA hydroxymethylation modulates cancer development, and specifically, whether and how BPA and its analogs promote breast cancer development via DNA hydroxymethylation. We aimed to explore the interplay of the estrogenic activity of bisphenols at environmental exposure dose levels with TET dioxygenase-catalyzed DNA hydroxymethylation and to elucidate their roles in the proliferation of ER+ breast cancer cells as stimulated by environmentally relevant bisphenols. Human MCF-7 and T47D cell lines were used as ER-dependent breast cell proliferation models, and the human MDA-MB-231 cell line was used as an ER-independent breast cell model. These cells were treated with BPA or bisphenol S (BPS) to examine BPA/BPS-related proliferation. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to detect DNA hydroxymethylation. Crispr/Cas9 and RNA interference technologies, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot analyses were used to evaluate the expression and function of genes. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), bisulfite sequencing-PCR (BSP), and chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) were used to identify the interactions of target proteins. We measured higher proliferation in ER+ breast cancer cells treated with BPA or its replacement, BPS, accompanied by an ERα-dependent decrease in genomic DNA hydroxymethylation. The results of our overexpression, knockout, knockdown, and inhibition experiments suggested that TET2-catalyzed DNA hydroxymethylation played a suppressive role in BPA/BPS-stimulated cell proliferation. On the other hand, we observed that TET2 was negatively regulated by the activation of ERα (dimerized and phosphorylated), which was also induced by BPA/BPS binding. Instead of a direct interaction between TET2 and ERα, data of our Co-IP, BSP, and ChIP-qPCR experiments indicated that the activated ERα increased the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)-mediated promoter methylation of TET2, leading to an inhibition of the TET2 expression and DNA hydroxymethylation. We identified a new feedback circuit of ERα activation-DNMT-TET2-DNA hydroxymethylation in ER+ breast cancer cells and uncovered a pivotal role of TET2-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation in modulating BPA/BPS-stimulated proliferation. Moreover, to our knowledge, we for the first time established a linkage among chemical exposure, DNA hydroxymethylation, and tumor-associated proliferation. These findings further clarify the estrogenic activity of BPA/BPS and its profound implications for the regulation of epigenetic DNA hydroxymethylation and cell proliferation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5862.",PMC7064327

Models were underpinned by a common training set of 1,746 chemicals compiled from a combined data set of 11 ToxCast™/Tox21 HTS in vitro assays. The resulting models were evaluated using curated literature data extracted from different sources. To overcome the limitations of single-model approaches, CoMPARA predictions were combined into consensus models that provided averaged predictive accuracy of approximately 80% for the evaluation set. The strengths and limitations of the consensus predictions were discussed with example chemicals; then, the models were implemented into the free and open-source OPERA application to enable screening of new chemicals with a defined applicability domain and accuracy assessment. This implementation was used to screen the entire EPA DSSTox database of ∼875,000 chemicals, and their predicted AR activities have been made available on the EPA CompTox Chemicals dashboard and National Toxicology Program's Integrated Chemical Environment. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5580.",PMC7064318

Defining their presence or absence in extant animal lineages is critical to accurately devise evolutionary patterns, physiological shifts and the impact of endocrine disrupting chemicals. Here, we address the evolution of retinoic acid (RA) signalling in the Priapulida worm, Priapuluscaudatus Lamarck, 1816, an Ecdysozoa. RA signalling has been shown to be central to chordate endocrine homeostasis, participating in multiple developmental and physiological processes. Priapulids, with their slow rate of molecular evolution and phylogenetic position, represent a key taxon to investigate the early phases of Ecdysozoa evolution. By exploring a draft genome assembly, we show, by means of phylogenetics and functional assays, that an orthologue of the nuclear receptor retinoic acid receptor (RAR) subfamily, a central mediator of RA signalling, is present in Ecdysozoa, contrary to previous perception. We further demonstrate that the Priapulida RAR displays low-affinity for retinoids (similar to annelids), and is not responsive to common endocrine disruptors acting via RAR. Our findings provide a timeline for RA signalling evolution in the Bilateria and give support to the hypothesis that the increase in RA affinity towards RAR is a late acquisition in the evolution of the Metazoa.",PMC6947571

While numerous studies have characterized the effects of EDCs on temperate fishes, less is known on the effects of EDCs on the growth and reproductive physiology of tropical species. To determine the long-term effects of early-life exposure to common estrogenic chemicals, we exposed Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) yolk-sac fry to 17β-estradiol (E2) and nonylphenol (NP) and subsequently characterized the expression of genes involved in growth and reproduction in adults. Fry were exposed to waterborne E2 (0.1 and 1 μg/L) and NP (10 and 100 μg/L) for 21 days. After the exposure period, juveniles were reared for an additional 112 days until males were sampled. Gonadosomatic index was elevated in fish exposed to E2 (0.1 μg/L) while hepatosomatic index was decreased by exposure to NP (100 μg/L). Exposure to E2 (0.1 μg/L) induced hepatic growth hormone receptor (ghr) mRNA expression. The high concentration of E2 (1 μg/L), and both concentrations of NP, increased hepatic insulin-like growth-factor 1 (igf1) expression; E2 and NP did not affect hepatic igf2 and pituitary growth hormone (gh) levels. Both E2 (1 μg/L) and NP (10 μg/L) induced hepatic igf binding protein 1b (igfbp1b) levels while only NP (100 μg/L) induced hepatic igfbp2b levels. By contrast, hepatic igfbp6b was reduced in fish exposed to E2 (1 μg/L). There were no effects of E2 or NP on hepatic igfbp4 and igfbp5a expression. Although the expression of three vitellogenin transcripts was not affected, E2 and NP stimulated hepatic estrogen receptor (erα and erβ) mRNA expression. We conclude that tilapia exposed to E2 and NP as yolk-sac fry exhibit subsequent changes in the endocrine systems that control growth and reproduction during later life stages.",PMC6935514

This study used several bioassays and quantitative chemical analyses to assess residence-time weighted samples at six sites along a river in the northeastern United States beginning upstream from a wastewater treatment plant outfall and proceeding downstream along the stream reach to a drinking water treatment plant. Known steroidal estrogens were quantified and changes in signaling pathway molecular initiating events (activation of estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, peroxisome proliferator-activated, pregnane X receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling networks) were identified in water extracts. In initial multi-endpoint assays geographic and receptor-specific endocrine activity patterns in transcription factor signatures and nuclear receptor activation were discovered. In subsequent single endpoint receptor-specific bioassays, estrogen (16 of 18 samples; 0.01 to 28 ng estradiol equivalents [E2Eqs]/L) glucocorticoid (3 of 18 samples; 1.8 to 21 ng dexamethasone equivalents [DexEqs]/L), and androgen (2 of 18 samples; 0.95 to 2.1 ng dihydrotestosterone equivalents [DHTEqs]/L) receptor transcriptional activation occurred above respective assay method detection limits (0.04 ng E2Eqs/L, 1.2 ng DexEqs/L, and 0.77 ng DHTEqs/L) in multiple sampling events. Estrogen activity, the most often detected, correlated well with measured concentrations of known steroidal estrogens (r2 = 0.890). Overall, activity indicative of multiple types of endocrine active compounds was highest in wastewater effluent samples, while activity downstream was progressively lower, and negligible in unfinished treated drinking water. Not only was estrogenic and glucocorticoid activity confirmed in the effluent by utilizing multiple methods concurrently, but other activated signaling networks that historically received less attention (i.e. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) were also detected.",PMC9136853

In particular, the hormone balance during gestation is delicate, and disturbance may cause acute or chronic long-term health effects. A potential endocrine disruption may be provoked by in utero exposure to xenoestrogens mimicking endogenous estrogens. The mycoestrogen zearalenone (ZEN), a toxic fungal secondary metabolite and mycotoxin found frequently in food and feed, constitutes a prominent example. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the transfer as well as phase I and phase II metabolism of ZEN at the human placental barrier. Human placentas were perfused with 1μM (318μg/L) ZEN for 6 h. Samples from the maternal and fetal compartment, placental tissue, and fetal plasma were analyzed by a highly sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS assay to detect ZEN as well as nine key metabolites (α-zearalenol, β-zearalenol, zearalanone, α-zearalanol, β-zearalanol, ZEN-14-glucuronide, α-zearalenol-14-glucuronide, β-zearalenol-14-glucuronide, ZEN-14-sulfate). The model revealed a fast maternofetal transfer of ZEN across the human placental barrier. We also unraveled phase I and phase II metabolism of the parent toxin ZEN into the approximately 70-times more estrogenic α-zearalenol and the less active ZEN-14-sulfate conjugate, which are effectively released into the maternal and fetal circulation in considerable amounts. Our findings suggest that exposure to ZEN (such as through consumption of ZEN-contaminated cereal-based products) during pregnancy may result in in utero exposure of the fetus, not only to ZEN but also some of its highly estrogenically active metabolites. In the light of the known affinity of ZEN and potentially co-occurring xenoestrogens to the estrogen receptor, and our results demonstrating placental transfer of ZEN and its metabolites in an ex vivo model, we recommend further research and more comprehensive assessment of gestational exposures in women. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4860.",PMC6867367

The present study evaluated the effects of selected common environmental EDCs on secretion of inflammatory biomarkers by RAW264.7 cells. The EDCs investigated were Estradiol (E2), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and Bisphenol A (BPA). To evaluate if the effects caused by EDCs were modulated by steroid hormone receptors, antagonists of estrogen and androgen receptors were used. The steroid receptor antagonists used were Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, and Flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist. Secretion of biomarkers of inflammation, namely nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), were monitored. The NO was determined using Griess reaction and IL-6 was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although 5 μg/mL E2, DHT, and BPA were not toxic to RAW264.7 cell cultures, the same treatments significantly (p < 0.001) reduced both NO and IL-6 secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cell cultures. The suppression of NO and IL-6 secretion indicate inhibition of inflammation by DHT, E2, and BPA. The inhibitory effects of DHT, E2 and BPA are partially mediated via their cellular receptors, because the effects were reversed by their respective receptor antagonists. Flutamide reversed the effects of DHT, while Tamoxifen reversed the effects of E2 and BPA. In conclusion, E2, BPA, and DHT inhibit the synthesis of inflammation biomarkers by LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The inhibitory effects of EDCs can be partially reversed by the addition of an estrogen receptor antagonist for E2 and BPA, and an androgenic receptor antagonist for DHT. The inhibition of inflammatory response in stimulated RAW264.7 cells may be a useful bioassay model for monitoring estrogenic and androgenic pollutants.",PMC6721122

Recent studies report widespread usage and exposure to many BPA-like chemicals (BPs) that are structurally or functionally similar to BPA. However, the biological actions and toxicity of those BPs are still relatively unknown. To address this data gap, we used in vitro cell models to evaluate the ability of 22 BPs to induce or inhibit estrogenic and androgenic activity. BPA, Bisphenol AF (BPAF), bisphenol Z (BPZ), bisphenol C (BPC), tetramethyl bisphenol A (TMBPA), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol E (BPE), 4,4-bisphenol F (4,4-BPF), bisphenol AP (BPAP), bisphenol B (BPB), tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA), and benzylparaben (PHBB) induced estrogen receptor (ER)α and/or ERβ-mediated activity. With the exception of BPS, TCBPA, and PHBB, these same BPs were also androgen receptor (AR) antagonists. Only 3 BPs were found to be ER antagonists. Bisphenol P (BPP) selectively inhibited ERβ-mediated activity and 4-(4-phenylmethoxyphenyl)sulfonylphenol (BPS-MPE) and 2,4-bisphenol S (2,4-BPS) selectively inhibited ERα-mediated activity. None of the BPs induced AR-mediated activity. In addition, we identify that the BPs can bind to ER or AR with varying degrees by a molecular modeling analysis. Taken together, these findings help us to understand the molecular mechanism of BPs and further consideration of their usage in consumer products.",PMC6813750

However, current toxicology testing does not thoroughly explore the endocrine disrupting effects of industrial chemicals, which may have low dose effects not predicted when determining the limit of toxicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the endocrine disrupting potential of a broad range of chemicals used in the petrochemical sector. Therefore, 139 chemicals were classified for reproductive toxicity based on the United Nations Globally Harmonized System for hazard classification. These chemicals were evaluated in PubMed for reported endocrine disrupting activity, and their endocrine disrupting potential was estimated by identifying chemicals with active nuclear receptor endpoints publicly available databases. Evaluation of ToxCast data suggested that these chemicals preferentially alter the activity of the estrogen receptor (ER). Four chemicals were prioritized for in vitro testing using the ER-positive, immortalized human uterine Ishikawa cell line and a range of concentrations below the reported limit of toxicity in humans. We found that 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol (BHT) and diethanolamine (DEA) repressed the basal expression of estrogen-responsive genes PGR, NPPC, and GREB1 in Ishikawa cells, while tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and 2,2'-methyliminodiethanol (MDEA) induced the expression of these genes. Furthermore, low-dose combinations of PCE and MDEA produced additive effects. All four chemicals interfered with estradiol-mediated induction of PGR, NPPC, and GREB1. Molecular docking demonstrated that these chemicals could bind to the ligand binding site of ERα, suggesting the potential for direct stimulatory or inhibitory effects. We found that these chemicals altered rates of proliferation and regulated the expression of cell proliferation associated genes.

The main source of BPA exposure comes from the contamination of food and water by plastic storage containers or disposable bottles, among others, in which case BPA is easily ingested. Exposure to BPA during early pregnancy leads to lifelong effects; however, its effect on the immune system has not been fully studied. Since endocrine and immune systems interact in a bidirectional manner, the disruption of the former may cause permanent alterations of the latter, thus affecting a future anti-parasitic response. In this study, neonate BALB/c mice were exposed to a single dose of BPA (250 μg/kg); once sexual maturity was reached, they were orally infected with Trichinella spiralis (T. spiralis). The analyses performed after 5 days of infection revealed a decreased parasitic load in the duodenum of mice in the BPA-treated group. Flow cytometry analyses also revealed changes in the immune cell subpopulations of the infected animals when compared to the BPA-treated group. RT-PCR analyses of duodenum samples showed an increased expression of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-9 in the BPA-treated group.

Neurodevelopmental effects of BPA exposure are a major concern with multiple rodent and human studies showing that early life BPA exposure may impact the developing brain and sexually dimorphic behaviors. The CLARITY-BPA (Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity) program was established to assess multiple endpoints, including neural, across a wide dose range. Studies from our lab as part of (and prior to) CLARITY-BPA have shown that BPA disrupts estrogen receptor expression in the developing brain, and some evidence of oxytocin (OT) and oxytocin receptor (OTR) disruption in the hypothalamus and amygdala. While BPA disruption of steroid hormone function is well documented, less is known about its capacity to alter nonapeptide signals. In this CLARITY-BPA follow up study, we used remaining juvenile rat tissues to test the hypothesis that developmental BPA exposure affects OTR expression across the brain. Perinatal BPA exposure (2.5, 25, or 2500 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day) spanned gestation and lactation with dams gavaged from gestational day 6 until birth and then the offspring gavaged directly through weaning. Ethinyl estradiol (0.5 μg/kg bw/day) was used as a reference estrogen. Animals of both sexes were sacrificed as juveniles and OTR expression assessed by receptor binding. Our results demonstrate prenatal exposure to BPA can eliminate sex differences in OTR expression in three hypothalamic regions, and that male OTR expression may be more susceptible.

C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP develop a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) at adulthood, but similarly-exposed FVB/N mice are not affected. Here we aim to understand the reasons behind this drastic difference that should depend on the genome of the strain. In both backgrounds, pregnant female mice received per os either DEHP or corn oil vehicle and the male filiations were examined. Computer-assisted sperm analysis showed a DEHP-induced decreased sperm count and velocities in C57BL/6J. Sperm RNA sequencing experiments resulted in the identification of the 62 most differentially expressed RNAs. These RNAs, mainly regulated by hormones, produced strain-specific transcriptional responses to prenatal exposure to DEHP; a pool of RNAs was increased in FVB, another pool of RNAs was decreased in C57BL/6J. In FVB/N, analysis of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) impacting SHP identified rs387782768 and rs29315913 respectively associated with absence of the Forkhead Box A3 (Foxa3) RNA and increased expression of estrogen receptor 1 variant 4 (NM_001302533) RNA. Analysis of the role of SNPs modifying SHP binding sites in function of strain-specific responses to DEHP revealed a DEHP-resistance allele in FVB/N containing an additional FOXA1-3 binding site at rs30973633 and four DEHP-induced beta-defensins (Defb42, Defb30, Defb47 and Defb48).

Finally, targeted experiments confirmed increased methylation in the Svs3ab promoter with decreased SEMG2 persisting across generations, providing a molecular explanation for the transgenerational sperm velocity decrease found in C57BL/6J after DEHP exposure.

To better characterize the ability of exogenous compounds to bind and activate ERRγ, we used a combination of cell-based, biochemical, structural and computational approaches. A purposely created stable cell line allowed for the determination of the EC50s for over 30 environmental ERRγ ligands, including previously unknown ones. Interestingly, affinity constants (Kds) of the most potent compounds measured by isothermal titration calorimetry were in the 50-500 nM range, in agreement with their receptor activation potencies. Crystallographic analysis of the interaction between the ERRγ ligand-binding domain (LBD) and compounds of the bisphenol, alkylphenol and naphthol families revealed a partially shared binding mode and minimal alterations of the receptor conformation upon ligand binding. Further biophysical characterizations coupled to molecular dynamics simulations suggested a mechanism through which ERRγ ligands would exhibit their agonistic properties by preserving the transcriptionally active form of the receptor while rigidifying some loop regions with associated functions. This unique mechanism contrasts with the classical one involving a ligand-induced repositioning and stabilization of the C-terminal activation helix H12.",PMC11105698

Neither the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780 nor the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 was able to block the QpE-induced lipid accumulation. RNAseq analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocytes exposed to QpE suggests that this compound exerts its lipid accumulation effects via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-mediated pathway, a nuclear receptor whose modulation influences lipid metabolism. QpE was further shown to be active in a PPARγ reporter gene assay at 100 µM, reaching 4% of the maximal response produced by rosiglitazone, which acts as a positive control. This indicates that lipid accumulation induced by QpE is only in part caused by PPARγ activation.

However, other HA receptors (HARE and LYVE-1) are also overexpressing in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Therefore, polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification of HA-based DDS is necessary to reduce RES capture. Unfortunately, pegylation remarkably inhibits tumor cellular uptake and endosomal escapement, significantly compromising the in vivo antitumor efficacy. Herein, we developed a Dox-loaded HA-based transformable supramolecular nanoplatform (Dox/HCVBP) to overcome this dilemma. Dox/HCVBP contains a tumor extracellular acidity-sensitive detachable PEG shell achieved by a benzoic imine linkage. The in vitro and in vivo investigations further demonstrated that Dox/HCVBP could be in a ""stealth"" state at blood stream for a long circulation time due to the buried HA ligands and the minimized nonspecific interaction by PEG shell. However, it could transform into a ""recognition"" state under the tumor acidic microenvironment for efficient tumor cellular uptake due to the direct exposure of active targeting ligand HA following PEG shell detachment.

The main objectives of the current research were to characterize rainbow trout (rt) liver slice-mediated in vitro metabolism of model parent cyclic phenones exhibiting disparity between ER binding and ER-mediated Vtg gene induction, and to assess the metabolic competency of fish liver in vitro tests to help determine the chemical form (parent and/or metabolite) associated with the observed biological response.4. GC-MS, HPLC and LC-MS/MS technologies were applied to investigate the in vitro biotransformation of cyclobutyl phenyl ketone (CBP), benzophenone (DPK), cyclohexyl phenyl ketone (CPK) mostly in the absence of standards for metabolite characterization.5. It was concluded that estrogenic effects of the studied cyclic phenones are mediated by the parent chemical structure for DPK, but by active metabolites for CPK. A definitive interpretation was not possible for CBP and CBPOH (alcohol), although a contribution of both structures to gene induction is suspected.",PMC9726639

This method has the potential to be applied for discovering molecular initiating events (MIEs) in the Adverse Outcome Pathway framework. In this study, we aimed to develop in silico⁻in vivo combined approach as a tool for identifying potential MIEs. We used environmental chemicals from Tox21 database to identify potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) through molecular docking simulation, using estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR) and their homology models in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (NHR-14 and NHR-69, respectively). In vivo validation was conducted on the selected EDCs with C. elegans reproductive toxicity assay using wildtype N2, nhr-14, and nhr-69 loss-of-function mutant strains. The chemicals showed high binding affinity to tested receptors and showed the high in vivo reproductive toxicity, and this was further confirmed using the mutant strains. The present study demonstrates that the binding affinity from the molecular docking potentially correlates with in vivo toxicity. These results prove that our in silico⁻in vivo combined approach has the potential to be applied for identifying MIEs. This study also suggests the potential of C. elegans as useful in the in vivo model for validating the in silico approach.",PMC6429066

The formed nano-dBSA film served as the cross-linker to immobilize monoclonal antibody against carcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA mAb) on the graphene channel activated by EDC and Sulfo-NHS. The nano-dBSA film worked as a self-protecting layer of graphene to prevent surface contamination by lithographic processing. The improved GFET biosensor exhibited good specificity and high sensitivity toward the target at an ultralow concentration of 337.58 fg mL-1.

Little is known about how the temperatures associated with global climate change may influence the response of organisms exposed to EDCs, and the effects that these combined stressors may have on molecular endpoints such as gene expression. We exposed Menidia beryllina (inland silversides) to environmentally relevant concentrations (1 ng/L) of two estrogenic EDCs (bifenthrin and 17α-ethinylestradiol; EE2) at 22 °C and 28 °C. We conducted this experiment over multiple generations to better understand the potential effects to chronically exposed populations in the wild. We exposed adult parental fish (F0) for 14 days prior to spawning of the next generation. F1 larvae were then exposed from fertilization until 21 days post hatch (dph) before being transferred to clean water tanks. F1 larvae were reared to adulthood, then spawned in clean water to test for further effects of parental exposure on offspring (F2 generation). Gene expression was quantified by performing qPCR on F0 and F1 gonads, as well as F1 and F2 larvae. We did not detect any significant differences in the expression of genes measured in the parental or F1 adult gonads. We found that the 28 °C EE2 treatment significantly decreased the expression of nearly all genes measured in the F1 larvae. This pattern was transferred to the F2 generation for expression of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene. Expression of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) and G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) revealed changes not measured in the previous generation. Effects of the bifenthrin treatments were not observed until the F2 generation, which were exposed to the chemicals indirectly as germ cells. Our results indicate that effects of EDCs and their interactions with abiotic factors, may not be adequately represented by singular generation testing. These findings will contribute to the determination of the risk of EDC contamination to organisms inhabiting contaminated waterways under changing temperature regimes.",PMC6329337

Unlike alternative luminescent reporters, this bioreporter generates bioluminescence autonomously without requiring an external light-activating chemical substrate or cellular destruction. The bioreporter's performance was validated against a library of 76 agonistic and antagonistic estrogenic endocrine disruptor chemicals and demonstrated reproducible half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values meeting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for Tier 1 endocrine disrupting chemical screening assays. For model compounds, such as the estrogen receptor (ER) agonist 17β-estradiol, HEK293ERE/Gal4-Lux demonstrated an EC50 value (7.9 × 10-12 M) comparable to that of the current EPA-approved HeLa-9903 firefly luciferase-based estrogen receptor transcription assay (4.6 × 10-12 M). Screening against an expanded array of common ER agonists likewise produced similar relative effect potencies as compared with existing assays. The self-initiated autobioluminescent signal of the bioreporter permitted facile monitoring of the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals, which decreased the cost and hands-on time required to perform these assays.

Research data comprising chemical physicochemical properties, toxicity, assay, and activity details create massive data which are becoming difficult to manage. Identifying the desired featured chemical with the desired biological activity from millions of chemicals is a challenging task. In this study, we investigate and explore big data technologies and machine learning approaches to do an efficient chemical data mining for endocrine receptor disruption prediction and virtual compound screening. The power of artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting chemicals' activity toward androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) and thereby classifying into human endocrine disruptor or nondisruptor is investigated. Molecules are collected along with their Inhibitory Concentration (IC 50) values toward AR and ER. Training and test datasets are created with active and inactive classes of molecules. Molecular fingerprints of Electro Topological State (E-State) are generated for describing every compound. ANN machine learning model is created using Apache Spark and implemented in Hadoop big data environment. Test chemical's structural similarity toward active class of training compounds is estimated and combined with ANN model for improving prediction accuracy. AR and ER predictive models applied on corresponding test datasets gave 86.31% and 89.57% accuracies, respectively, in correctly classifying molecules as disruptor or nondisruptor. Molecular fragments and functional groups are ranked based on their importance in forming ANN model and influence toward the AR and ER disruption behavior. Training molecules that are specific to the test molecules' endocrine disruption prediction are retrieved based on the structural similarity values. The current study demonstrates a new approach of chemical endocrine receptor disruption prediction combining ANN machine learning method and molecular similarity in a big data environment.

Herein, we report the first SAR of a public dataset of 121 chemicals with reported estrogen receptor binding affinities using activity landscape modeling. To this end, we conducted a systematic quantitative and visual analysis of the chemical space of the 121 chemicals. The global diversity of the dataset was characterized by means of Consensus Diversity Plot, a recently developed method. Adding pairwise activity difference information to the chemical space gave rise to the activity landscape of the data set uncovering a heterogeneous SAR, in particular for some structural classes.

It gave us the opportunity to explore a multiplicity of biophysical mechanisms, e.g., how bacterial adhesins bind to host surface receptors in more detail. Among other factors, the success of SMFS experiments depends on the functional and native immobilization of the biomolecules of interest on solid surfaces and AFM tips. Here, we describe a straightforward protocol for the covalent coupling of proteins to silicon surfaces using silane-PEG-carboxyls and the well-established N-hydroxysuccinimid/1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)carbodiimid (EDC/NHS) chemistry in order to explore the interaction of pilus-1 adhesin RrgA from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) with the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (Fn). Our results show that the surface functionalization leads to a homogenous distribution of Fn on the glass surface and to an appropriate concentration of RrgA on the AFM cantilever tip, apparent by the target value of up to 20% of interaction events during SMFS measurements and revealed that RrgA binds to Fn with a mean force of 52 pN.

BPA analogs, such as the bisphenols S, F, and AF (BPS, BPF, and BPAF) are increasingly used as replacement chemicals, although they were found to exert estrogenic effects similar to those of BPA. Research has shown that only the parent compounds have affinity to the estrogen receptors, suggesting that the pharmacokinetic behavior of bisphenols (BPs) can influence their potency. Our goal was to compare the pharmacokinetic behaviors of BPA, BPS, BPF, and BPAF for different age groups after environmentally relevant external exposures by taking into account substance-specific metabolism kinetics and partitioning behavior. This comparison allowed us to investigate the consequences of replacing BPA with other BPs. We readjusted a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for peroral exposure to BPA and extended it to include dermal exposure. We experimentally assessed hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation kinetics of BPS, BPF, and BPAF to parametrize the model for these BPs and calibrated the BPS model with a biomonitoring study. We used the PBPK models to compare resulting internal exposures and focused on females of childbearing age in a two-dimensional Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. Within environmentally relevant concentration ranges, BPAF and BPS were glucuronized at highest and lowest rates, respectively, in the intestine and the liver. The predominant routes of BPS and BPAF exposure were peroral and dermal exposure, respectively. The calibration of the BPS model with measured concentrations showed that enterohepatic recirculation may be important. Assuming equal external exposures, BPS exposure led to the highest internal concentrations of unconjugated BPs. Our data suggest that the replacement of BPA with structural analogs may not lower the risk for endocrine disruption. Exposure to both BPS and BPAF might be more critical than BPA exposure, if their respective estrogenic potencies are taken into account. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2739.",PMC6108829

We hypothesized that these metabolites bind to the human estrogen receptor (ER) and promote estrogen signaling. We tested this using models of ER-mediated cellular proliferation. The estrogenic properties of 3-hydroxy n-butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (3OH) and 2-hydroxy iso-butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (2OH) were determined using the ER-positive, estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, and T47D. The 3OH metabolite induced cellular proliferation with EC50 of 8.2 µM in MCF-7 cells. The EC50 for 3OH in T47D cells could not be reached. The 2OH metabolite induced proliferation with EC50 of 2.2 µM and 43.0 µM in MCF-7 and T47D cells, respectively. The EC50 for the parental IsoBuP and BuP was 0.30 and 1.2 µM in MCF-7 cells, respectively. The expression of a pro-proliferative, estrogen-inducible gene (GREB1) was induced by these compounds and blocked by co-administration of an ER antagonist (ICI 182, 780), confirming the ER-dependence of these effects. The metabolites promoted significant ER-dependent transcriptional activity of an ERE-luciferase reporter construct at 10 and 20 µM for 2OH and 10 µM for 3OH. Computational docking studies showed that the paraben compounds exhibited the potential for favorable ligand-binding domain interactions with human ERα in a manner similar to known x-ray crystal structures of 17ß-estradiol in complex with ERα.

Conventional studies evaluate toxicity by administering a single substance to cells or animals, but evaluation of the toxicity of mixtures of these ingested compounds is essential for ""true"" toxicological assessment. We evaluated toxic effects in vitro using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). TBBPA increased the number of lipid droplets, and upregulated the expression of adipocyte-related mRNA, aP2 and LPL, through a PPARγ-dependent mechanism. TCDD suppressed lipid droplets and adipocyte-related mRNA levels. Adipocyte differentiation was stimulated by TBBPA and inhibited by TCDD in a dose-dependent manner. TBBPA did not influence osteoblast differentiation, but TCDD suppressed ALP staining and activity, calcium deposition, and osteoblast-related mRNA levels. In a mixture of TBBPA and TCDD, TBBPA inhibited TCDD suppression of adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation in a dose-dependent manner.

Identifying and characterizing toxic hazards based on the manner by which adverse effects are produced rather than on the nature of those adverse effects departs from traditional practice and requires a proper interpretation of the evidence regarding the chemical's ability to produce physiological effect(s) via a specific mode of action (MoA). The ability of any chemical to produce a physiological effect depends on its pharmacokinetics and the potency by which it acts via the various MoAs that can lead to the particular effect. A chemical's potency for a specific MoA-its mechanistic potency-is determined by two properties: (1) its affinity for the functional components that comprise the MoA, i.e., its specific receptors, enzymes, transporters, transcriptional elements, etc., and (2) its ability to alter the functional state of those components (activity). Using the agonist MoA via estrogen receptor alpha, we illustrate an empirical method for determining a human-relevant potency threshold (HRPT), defined as the minimum level of mechanistic potency necessary for a chemical to be able to act via a particular MoA in humans. One important use for an HRPT is to distinguish between chemicals that may be capable of, versus those likely to be incapable of, producing adverse effects in humans via the specified MoA. The method involves comparing chemicals that have different ERα agonist potencies with the ability of those chemicals to produce ERα-mediated agonist responses in human clinical trials. Based on this approach, we propose an HRPT for ERα agonism of 1E-04 relative to the potency of the endogenous estrogenic hormone 17β-estradiol or the pharmaceutical estrogen, 17α-ethinylestradiol.

The high-resolution EDA approach is demonstrated by analysis of four environmental passive sampler extracts. Downscaling of the assays to a 384-well format allowed analysis of 64 fractions in triplicate (or 192 fractions without technical replicates) without affecting sensitivity compared to the standard 96-well format.

Affinities were assessed using recombinant TRβ protein in competitive binding assays with 125I-triiodothyronine (125I-T3) as the radioligand. Zebrafish and human TRβ displayed similar binding affinities for T3 (Ki = 0.40 and 0.49 nM) and thyroxine (T4, Ki = 6.7 and 6.8 nM). TRβ affinity increased with increasing halogen mass and atomic radius for both species, with the iodinated compounds having the highest affinity within their compound classes. Increasing halogen mass and radius increases the molecular weight, volume, and hydrophobicity of a compound, which are all highly correlated with increasing affinity. TRβ affinity also increased with the degree of halogenation for both species. Human TRβ displayed higher binding affinities for the halogenate bisphenol A compounds, whereas zebrafish TRβ displayed higher affinities for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trifluorophenol. Observed species differences may be related to amino acid differences within the ligand binding domains. Overall, structural variations impact TRβ affinities in a similar manner, supporting the use of zebrafish as a model for TRβ disruption. Further studies are necessary to investigate how the identified structural modifications impact downstream receptor activities and potential in vivo effects.",PMC5920296

Recently, there has been widespread usage of bisphenol chemicals (BPs), such as bisphenol AF (BPAF) and bisphenol S (BPS), as replacements for BPA. However, the potential biological actions, toxicity, and the molecular mechanism of these compounds are still poorly understood. Our objective was to examine the estrogenic effects of BPA, BPAF, and BPS and the molecular mechanisms of action in the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) complex. In vitro cell models were used to compare the estrogenic effects of BPA, BPAF, and BPS to estrogen. Microarray Assay for Real-Time Coregulator-Nuclear receptor Interaction (MARCoNI) analysis was used to identify coregulators of BPA, BPAF, and BPS, and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to determine the compounds binding in the ERα complex. We demonstrated that BPA and BPAF have agonistic activity for both ERα and ERβ, but BPS has ERα-selective specificity. We concluded that coregulators were differentially recruited in the presence of BPA, BPAF, or BPS. Interestingly, BPS recruited more corepressors when compared to BPA and BPAF. From a series of MD analysis, we concluded that BPA, BPAF, and BPS can bind to the ER-ligand-binding domain with differing energetics and conformations. In addition, the binding surface of coregulator interactions on ERα was characterized for the BPA, BPAF, and BPS complexes. These findings further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of EDCs, such as BPs, in ER-mediated transcriptional activation, biological activity, and their effects on physiological functions in human health. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2505.",PMC6014695

Here, we profiled skin transcriptomes of mice reared in the presence and absence of microbiota to elucidate the range of pathways and functions modulated in the skin by the microbiota. A total of 2820 genes were differentially regulated in response to microbial colonization and were enriched in gene ontology (GO) terms related to the host-immune response and epidermal differentiation. Innate immune response genes and genes involved in cytokine activity were generally upregulated in response to microbiota and included genes encoding toll-like receptors, antimicrobial peptides, the complement cascade, and genes involved in IL-1 family cytokine signaling and homing of T cells. Our results also reveal a role for the microbiota in modulating epidermal differentiation and development, with differential expression of genes in the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). Genes with correlated co-expression patterns were enriched in binding sites for the transcription factors Klf4, AP-1, and SP-1, all implicated as regulators of epidermal differentiation. Finally, we identified transcriptional signatures of microbial regulation common to both the skin and the gastrointestinal tract.

Estrogenic ligands include both natural and manmade ""Environmental Estrogens"" (EEs) found in many consumer goods including Personal Care Products (PCPs), plastics, pesticides, and foods. EEs disrupt hormone signaling in humans and other animals, potentially reducing fertility and increasing disease risk. Despite the importance of EEs and other Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) to public health, endocrine disruption is not typically included in undergraduate curricula. This shortcoming is partly due to a lack of relevant laboratory activities that illustrate the principles involved while also being accessible to undergraduate students. This article presents an optimized YES for quantifying ligands in personal care products that bind estrogen receptors alpha (ERα) and/or beta (ERβ). The method incorporates one of the two colorimetric substrates (ortho-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) or chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG)) that are cleaved by β-galactosidase, a 6-day refrigerated incubation step to facilitate use in undergraduate laboratory courses, an automated application for LacZ calculations, and R code for the associated 4-parameter logistic regression analysis. The protocol has been designed to allow undergraduate students to develop and conduct experiments in which they screen products of their choosing for estrogen mimics. In the process, they learn about endocrine disruption, cell culture, receptor binding, enzyme activity, genetic engineering, statistics, and experimental design. Simultaneously, they also practice fundamental and broadly applicable laboratory skills, such as: calculating concentrations; making solutions; demonstrating sterile technique; serially diluting standards; constructing and interpolating standard curves; identifying variables and controls; collecting, organizing, and analyzing data; constructing and interpreting graphs; and using common laboratory equipment such as micropipettors and spectrophotometers.

A feature of the tested chemicals was that they induced Cyp2b10 in vivo implicating activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Recent studies suggest that these compounds could be indirect CAR activators via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition. Assays included a CAR activity reporter assay, EGF endocytosis assay, and EGFR phosphorylation assay. Docking simulations were used to identify putative binding sites for environmental chemicals on the EGFR. Whole-weight and lipid-adjusted serum mean pollutant exposures were determined using data from the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) and compared with the IC50 values determined in vitro. Chlordane, trans-nonachlor, PCB-126, PCB-153, and atrazine were the most potent EGFR inhibitors tested. PCB-126, PCB-153, and trans-nonachlor appeared to be competitive EGFR antagonists as they displaced bound EGF from EGFR. However, atrazine acted through a different mechanism and could be an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. EGFR inhibition relative effect potencies were determined for these compounds. In NHANES, serum concentrations of trans-nonachlor, PCB-126, and PCB-153 greatly exceeded their calculated IC50 values.

This highlights the urgency to develop fast and sensitive methods to detect EDCs, which are detrimental even at very low concentrations. In this work, we propose a label-free surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor method to detect specific EDCs (17 β-estradiol (E2), ethinyl-estradiol, 4-nonylphenol, tamoxifen) through their binding to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). We show that the use of rationally designed ERα (as bio-recognition element) in combination with conformation-sensitive peptides (as amplification agent, resulting in increased responses) enables the detection of low parts per billion (ppb) levels of E2. As a proof of concept, this bioassay was used to detect E2 in (spiked) real water samples from fish farms, rivers and the sea at low ppb levels after concentration by solid phase extraction.

In this study, we establish a noninvasive and label-free optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based imaging platform for tracking exposure-response relationships in 3D human mammary epithelial organoid models. The OCT-based assay includes metrics that quantify organoid intracellular kinetic energy and cross-sectional area (CSA). We compare the results to those obtained using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) mitochondrial dye conversion assay. Both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF7) and ER-negative (MCF10DCIS.com) breast cell lines were studied, beginning one hour after exposure and continuing for several days. Six days of exposure to 17β-estradiol or the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen respectively increased or decreased MCF7 organoid CSA (p < .01), consistent with the role of estrogen signaling in ER-positive mammary epithelial cell proliferation. We also observed a significant decrease in the intracellular kinetic energy of MCF10DCIS.com organoids after 24 h of exposure to doxorubicin, a cytotoxic intercalating agent that causes DNA double-strand breaks (p < .01).

Here, we investigated the effects of EE2 on maternal behavior and the maternal brain in females exposed during gestation and the perinatal period. We assessed several components of maternal behavior including nesting behavior and pup retrieval; characterized the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)α in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), a brain region critical for the display of maternal behavior; and measured expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, a marker for dopaminergic cells, in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain region important in maternal motivation. We found that developmental exposure to EE2 induces subtle effects on several aspects of maternal behavior including time building the nest and time spent engaged in self-care. Developmental exposure to EE2 also altered ERα expression in the central MPOA during both early and late lactation and led to significantly reduced tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the VTA. Our results demonstrate both dose- and postpartum stage-related effects of developmental exposure to EE2 on behavior and brain that manifest later in adulthood, during the maternal period. These findings provide further evidence for effects of exposure to exogenous estrogenic compounds during the critical periods of fetal and perinatal development.",PMC5938171

However, cell attachment studies often overlook the details of the substrate-cell binding mechanisms, be they integrin-mediated or non-specific, and ignore the class- and species-specificities of the cell adhesion receptor involved. In this work we have used different collagen (Col) substrates (fibrillar collagens I, II and III and network-forming Col IV), containing different affinity cell-recognition motifs, to establish the influence of the receptor identity and species-specificity on collagen-cell interactive properties. Receptor expression was varied by using cells of different origin, or transfecting collagen-binding integrins into integrin-null cells. These include mouse C2C12 myoblasts transfected with human α1, α2, α10 or α11; human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells which constitutively express only human α2β1, and rat glioma Rugli cells, with only rat α1β1. Using these lines, the nature of integrin binding sites was studied in order to delineate the bioactivity of different collagen substrates. Integrin ligation was studied on collagen coatings alongside synthetic (GFOGER/GLOGEN) and Toolkit (Col II-28/Col III-7) triple-helical peptides to evaluate (1) their affinity towards different integrins and (2) to confirm the activity of the inserted integrin in the transfected cells. Thin films of dermal and tendon Col I were used to evaluate the influence of the carbodiimide (EDC)-based treatment on the cellular response on Col of different origin. The results showed that the binding properties of transfected C2C12 cells to collagens depend on the identity of inserted integrin. Similar ligation characteristics were observed using α1+ and α10+ cells, but these were distinct from the similar binding features of α2+ and α11+ cells. Recombinant human and rat-α1 I domain binding to collagens and peptides correlated with the cell adhesion results, showing receptor class- and species-specificities. The understanding of the physiologically relevant cell anchorage characteristics of bio-constructs may assist in the selection of (1) the optimum collagen source for cellular supports and (2) the correct cellular model for their biological assessment. This, in turn, may allow reliable prediction of the biological performance of bio-scaffolds in vivo for specific TE applications. Integrins play a vital role in cellular responses to environmental cues during early-stage cell-substrate interaction. We describe physiologically relevant cell anchorage to collagen substrates that present different affinity cell-recognition motifs, to provide experimental tools to assist in understanding integrin binding. Using different cell types and recombinant integrin α1-I-domains, we found that cellular response was highly dependent on collagen type, origin and EDC-crosslinking status, as well as on the integrin class and species of origin. This comprehensive study establishes selectivity amongst the four collagen-binding integrins and species-specific properties that together may influence choice of cell type and receptor in different experimental settings.

Nuclear receptors are molecular sensors that play critical roles during development and, as such, are prime candidates to explain the developmental programming of disease risk by environmental chemicals. We have previously characterized the obesogen tributyltin (TBT), which activates the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) to increase adiposity in mice exposed in utero. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from these mice are biased toward the adipose lineage at the expense of the osteoblast lineage, and MSCs exposed to TBT in vitro are shunted toward the adipose fate in a PPARγ-dependent fashion. To address where in the adipogenic cascade TBT acts, we developed an in vitro commitment assay that permitted us to distinguish early commitment to the adipose lineage from subsequent differentiation. TBT and RXR activators (rexinoids) had potent effects in committing MSCs to the adipose lineage, whereas the strong PPARγ activator rosiglitazone was inactive. We show that activation of RXR is sufficient for adipogenic commitment and that rexinoids act through RXR to alter the transcriptome in a manner favoring adipogenic commitment. RXR activation alters expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and modifies genome-wide histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in promoting adipose commitment and programming subsequent differentiation. These data offer insights into the roles of RXR and EZH2 in MSC lineage specification and shed light on how endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as TBT can reprogram stem cell fate.",PMC5659689

In this study, we examined whether BPA, BPS, and BPF can lead to the proliferation, migration, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of MCF-7 clonal variant (MCF-7 CV) breast cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). In a cell viability assay, BPA, BPS, and BPF significantly increased proliferation of MCF-7 CV cells compared to control (DMSO) as did 17β-estradiol (E2). In Western blotting assay, BPA, BPS, and BPF enhanced the protein expression of cell cycle progression genes such as cyclin D1 and E1. In addition, MCF-7 CV cells lost cell to cell contacts and acquired fibroblast-like morphology by the treatment of BPA, BPS, or BPF for 24 hours. In cell migration assay, BPA, BPS, and BPF accelerated the migration capability of MCF-7 CV cells as did E2. In relation with the EMT process, BPA, BPS, and BPF increased the protein expression ofN-cadherin, while they decreased the protein expression of E-cadherin. When BPA, BPS, and BPF were co-treated with ICI 182,780, an ER antagonist, proliferation effects were reversed, the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 was downregulated, and the altered cell migration and expression ofN-cadherin and E-cadherin by BPA, BPS, and BPF were restored to the control level.

Among vertebrate species, the molecular components of TH signaling are highly conserved, including the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), their heterodimer binding partners the retinoid-X receptors (RXRs), and their DNA recognition sequences (TREs). This molecular conservation allows examination of potential TH disruption in the tractable, in vivo model system of amphibian metamorphosis. Metamorphosis requires TH signaling for both instigation and progression, and it provides dramatic and well-characterized phenotypes involving different cell fates. Here we describe a quantitative, precocious-metamorphosis assay suite we developed using one-week post-fertilization (PF) Xenopus laevis tadpoles in order to assess disruption of TH signaling. Tadpoles at this developmental stage (Nieuwkoop-Faber (NF)-48) are competent to respond to TH hormone, although not yet producing TH, along many metamorphic pathways, and they are uniform in size. This allowed us to quantify changes in morphology associated with natural metamorphosis (e.g. gill and tail resorption, brain expansion, and craniofacial remodeling) after five days of treatment. Using the same tadpoles from morphological measurements, we quantified a 20-fold increase in TH-induced cellular proliferation in the rostral head region by whole-mount immunocytochemistry. At the molecular level, we used F3-generation tadpoles from a transgenic X. laevis line, which expresses luciferase under the control of a native TRE, to assess the ability of compounds to disrupt TR function. The luciferase reporter showed over 10-fold activation by physiologic concentrations of TH. We used the synthetic TR antagonist NH-3 to demonstrate the feasibility of our assay suite to measure inhibition of TH activity at the level of the receptor. Finally, we assessed the capabilities of suspected TH-disrupting chemicals tetrabrominated diphenyl ether 47 (BDE-47) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). We found that BDE-47 displays general toxicity rather than TH disruption, as it did not increase brain width nor affect the TRE-luciferase reporter. However, TBBPA, a suspected TR antagonist, although not effective in antagonizing cell proliferation, significantly inhibited the TRE-luciferase reporter, suggesting that it bears closer scrutiny as a TH disruptor. Overall the assay suite has important advantages over the classical tadpole metamorphosis assays with respect to the uniformity of animal size, small test volume, reproducibility, and short test period.

EDC also caused an increase in myocardial protein S-nitrosylation, consistent with previous studies showing a role for this post-translational modification in cardioprotection. In further support of a role for S-nitrosylation, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase, but not soluble guanylyl cyclase blocked the EDC mediated protection. The administration of ICI182,780, which is an agonist of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and an antagonist of ERα and ERβ, did not result in protection; however, ICI182,780 significantly blocked EDC-mediated cardioprotection, indicating participation of ERα and/or ERβ. In studies determining the specific ER subtype and cellular target involved, EDC decreased infarct size and improved functional recovery in mice lacking ERα in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, protection was lost in mice deficient in endothelial cell ERα. Thus, extra-nuclear ERα activation in endothelium reduces cardiac I/R injury in mice, and this likely entails increased protein S-nitrosylation. Since EDC does not stimulate uterine growth, in the clinical setting EDC-like compounds may provide myocardial protection without undesired uterotrophic and cancer-promoting effects.",PMC5514412

Of all clinically distinct types of breast cancers, the most lethal phenotypic variant is inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR/HER2) along with estrogen receptor (ER) negativity is common in IBC tumor cells, which instead of a solid mass present as rapidly proliferating diffuse tumor cell clusters. Our previous studies have demonstrated a role of an adaptive response of increased antioxidants in acquired resistance to EGFR-targeting drugs in IBC. Environmental chemicals are known to induce oxidative stress resulting in perturbations in signal transduction pathways. It is therefore of interest to identify chemicals that can potentiate EGFR mitogenic effects in IBC. Herein, we assessed in ER-negative IBC cells a subset of chemicals from the EPA ToxCast set for their effect on EGFR activation and in multiple cancer phenotypic assays. We demonstrated that endocrine-disrupting chemicals such as bisphenol A (BPA) and 2,2-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane can increase EGFR/ERK signaling. BPA also caused a corresponding increase in expression of SOD1 and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, key markers of antioxidant and anti-apoptotic processes. BPA potentiated clonogenic growth and tumor spheroid formation in vitro, reflecting IBC-specific pathological characteristics. Furthermore, we identified that BPA was able to attenuate the inhibitory effect of an EGFR targeted drug in a longer-term anchorage-independent growth assay. These findings provide a potential mechanistic basis for environmental chemicals such as BPA in potentiating a hyperproliferative and death-resistant phenotype in cancer cells by activating mitogenic pathways to which the tumor cells are addicted for survival.",PMC5963742

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with several nuclear hormone receptors associated with a variety of adverse health effects. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has released its reviews of Tier 1 screening assay results for a set of pesticides in the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP), and recently, the Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project (CERAPP) data. In this study, the predictive ability of QSAR and docking approaches is evaluated using these data sets. This study also presents a computational systems biology approach using carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate) as a case study. For estrogen receptor and androgen receptor binding predictions, two commercial and two open source QSAR tools were used, as was the publicly available docking tool Endocrine Disruptome. For estrogen receptor binding predictions, the ADMET Predictor, VEGA, and OCHEM models (specificity: 0.88, 0.88, and 0.86, and accuracy: 0.81, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively) were each more reliable than the MetaDrug™ model (specificity 0.81 and accuracy 0.77).

A consensus approach is proposed that reaches general agreement among the models (specificity 0.94 and accuracy 0.89). This study integrates QSAR, docking, and systems biology approaches as a virtual screening tool for use in risk assessment. As such, this systems biology pathways and network analysis approach provides a means to more critically assess the potential effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals.",PMC8265162

In humans, abnormal maternal thyroid hormone levels during early pregnancy are associated with decreased offspring IQ and modified brain structure. As numerous environmental chemicals disrupt thyroid hormone signalling, we questioned whether exposure to ubiquitous chemicals affects thyroid hormone responses during early neurogenesis. We established a mixture of 15 common chemicals at concentrations reported in human amniotic fluid. An in vivo larval reporter (GFP) assay served to determine integrated thyroid hormone transcriptional responses. Dose-dependent effects of short-term (72 h) exposure to single chemicals and the mixture were found. qPCR on dissected brains showed significant changes in thyroid hormone-related genes including receptors, deiodinases and neural differentiation markers. Further, exposure to mixture also modified neural proliferation as well as neuron and oligodendrocyte size. Finally, exposed tadpoles showed behavioural responses with dose-dependent reductions in mobility. In conclusion, exposure to a mixture of ubiquitous chemicals at concentrations found in human amniotic fluid affect thyroid hormone-dependent transcription, gene expression, brain development and behaviour in early embryogenesis. As thyroid hormone signalling is strongly conserved across vertebrates the results suggest that ubiquitous chemical mixtures could be exerting adverse effects on foetal human brain development.",PMC5339866

However, its mode of action is unclear and a systematic analysis of its molecular targets is needed. In the present study, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP during a critical period for gonads differentiation to testes on male mice offspring reproductive parameters, including the genome-wide RNA expression and associated promoter methylation status in the sperm of the first filial generation. It was observed that adult male offspring displayed symptoms similar to the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome. A combination of sperm transcriptome and methylome data analysis allowed to detect a long-lasting DEHP-induced and robust promoter methylation-associated silencing of almost the entire cluster of the seminal vesicle secretory proteins and antigen genes, which are known to play a fundamental role in sperm physiology. It also resulted in the detection of a DEHP-induced promoter demethylation associated with an up-regulation of three genes apparently not relevant for sperm physiology and partially related to the immune system. As previously reported, DEHP induced an increase in mir-615 microRNA expression and a genome-wide decrease in microRNA promoter methylation. A functional analysis revealed DEHP-induced enrichments in down-regulated gene transcripts coding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways, and in up-regulated gene transcripts coding for calcium binding and numerous myosin proteins. All these enriched pathways and networks have been described to be associated in some way with the reproductive system.

Upon ligand binding, the LBP reshapes around the contours of the ligand and stabilizes the complex by complementary hydrophobic interactions and specific hydrogen bonds with the ligand. Here we present a framework for quantitative analysis of the steric and electronic features of the human ERα-ligand complex using three dimensional (3D) protein-ligand interaction description combined with 3D-QSAR approach. An empirical hydrophobicity density field is applied to account for hydrophobic contacts of ligand within the LBP. The obtained 3D-QSAR model revealed that hydrophobic contacts primarily determine binding affinity and govern binding mode with hydrogen bonds. Several residues of the LBP appear to be quite flexible and adopt a spectrum of conformations in various ERα-ligand complexes, in particular His524. The 3D-QSAR was combined with molecular docking based on three receptor conformations to accommodate receptor flexibility. The model indicates that the dynamic character of the LBP allows accommodation and stable binding of structurally diverse ligands, and proper representation of the protein flexibility is critical for reasonable description of binding of the ligands. Our results provide a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of binding affinity and mode of ERα agonists and antagonists that may be applicable to other nuclear receptors.",PMC5218732

In this study, commercially available, division-arrested cell lines were employed to quantitatively screen for endocrine activity of chemicals present in water samples of interest to environmental quality professionals. A single, standardized protocol that included comprehensive quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) checks was developed for Estrogen and Glucocorticoid Receptor activity (ER and GR, respectively) using a cell-based Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) assay. Samples of treated municipal wastewater effluent and surface water from freshwater systems in California (USA), were extracted using solid phase extraction and analyzed for endocrine activity using the standardized protocol. Background and dose-response for endpoint-specific reference chemicals met QA/QC guidelines deemed necessary for reliable measurement. The bioassay screening response for surface water samples was largely not detectable. In contrast, effluent samples from secondary treatment plants had the highest measurable activity, with estimated bioassay equivalent concentrations (BEQs) up to 392 ng dexamethasone/L for GR and 17 ng 17β-estradiol/L for ER. The bioassay response for a tertiary effluent sample was lower than that measured for secondary effluents, indicating a lower residual of endocrine active chemicals after advanced treatment.

We show that both A6 and an anilinopyrimidine, cyprodinyl, decrease larval survival and affect central neurons at micromolar concentrations. Focusing on a superficial and easily observable sensory system, the lateral line system, we found that defects in axonal and sensory cell regeneration can be observed at much lower doses, in the nanomolar range. We also show that A6 accumulates preferentially in lateral line neurons and hair cells. We examined whether A6 affects the expression of putative target genes, and found that genes involved in apoptosis/cell proliferation are down-regulated, as well as genes reflecting estrogen receptor activation, consistent with previous reports that anilinopyrimidines act as endocrine disruptors. On the other hand, canonical targets of endocrine signaling are not affected, suggesting that the neurotoxic effect of A6 may be due to the binding of this compound to a recently identified, neuron-specific estrogen receptor.",PMC5187937

Bisphenol A (BPA), one of the most active and widely used EDCs, affects ameloblast functions, leading to an enamel hypomineralization pattern similar to that of Molar Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH). In order to explore the molecular pathways stimulated by BPA during amelogenesis, we thoroughly investigated the receptors known to directly or indirectly mediate the effects of BPA. The expression patterns of high affinity BPA receptors (ERRγ, GPR30), of ketosteroid receptors (ERs, AR, PGR, GR, MR), of the retinoid receptor RXRα, and PPARγ were established using RT-qPCR analysis of RNAs extracted from microdissected enamel organ of adult rats. Their expression was dependent on the stage of ameloblast differentiation, except that of ERβ and PPARγ which remained undetectable. An additional large scale microarray analysis revealed three main groups of receptors according to their level of expression in maturation-stage ameloblasts. The expression level of RXRα was the highest, similar to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), whereas the others were 13 to 612-fold lower, with AR and GR being intermediate. Immunofluorescent analysis of VDR, ERα and AR confirmed their presence mainly in maturation- stage ameloblasts. These data provide further evidence that ameloblasts express a specific combination of hormonal receptors depending on their developmental stage. This study represents the first step toward understanding dental endocrinology as well as some of the effects of EDCs on the pathophysiology of amelogenesis.",PMC5090168

Exposure to BPA during development can disrupt sexual differentiation of some brain regions. Moreover, BPA can have transgenerational effects on gene expression and behaviors. Here, we used a diet and breeding regimen that produces transgenerational effects on behaviors. C57BL/6J mice consumed control or BPA-containing diets during pregnancy. We examined vasopressin (AVP) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) immunoreactivity (ir) in sexually dimorphic brain regions from first-generation (F1) offspring and transgenerational effects of BPA in third-generation offspring. In all but one brain region examined, the expected sex differences were noted in both generations of control mice. In F1 mice, a diet by sex interaction was present for AVP-ir in the lateral septum and posterodorsal medial amygdala. In both regions, BPA exposure reduced immunoreactivity in male brains. An interaction between diet and sex for ERα-ir in the ventromedial hypothalamus was caused by reduced immunoreactivity in BPA-exposed females. Of interest, BPA had transgenerational effects on ERα-ir in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Our data show that BPA produces immunoreactive differences in ERα-ir generations after exposure to BPA. We speculate that actions of BPA in utero on ERα-ir in brain have long-term consequences for reproduction and social behavior.",PMC5412975

Thus, evaluating potential ERα binding agents is critical in both drug discovery and chemical toxicity areas. Using computational tools, e.g., Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models, can predict potential ERα binding agents before chemical synthesis. The purpose of this project was to develop enhanced predictive models of ERα binding agents by utilizing advanced cheminformatics tools that can integrate publicly available bioassay data. The initial ERα binding agent data set, consisting of 446 binders and 8307 non-binders, was obtained from the Tox21 Challenge project organized by the NIH Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC). After removing the duplicates and inorganic compounds, this data set was used to create a training set (259 binders and 259 non-binders). This training set was used to develop QSAR models using chemical descriptors. The resulting models were then used to predict the binding activity of 264 external compounds, which were available to us after the models were developed. The cross-validation results of training set [Correct Classification Rate (CCR) = 0.72] were much higher than the external predictivity of the unknown compounds (CCR = 0.59). To improve the conventional QSAR models, all compounds in the training set were used to search PubChem and generate a profile of their biological responses across thousands of bioassays. The most important bioassays were prioritized to generate a similarity index that was used to calculate the biosimilarity score between each two compounds. The nearest neighbors for each compound within the set were then identified and its ERα binding potential was predicted by its nearest neighbors in the training set. The hybrid model performance (CCR = 0.94 for cross validation; CCR = 0.68 for external prediction) showed significant improvement over the original QSAR models, particularly for the activity cliffs that induce prediction errors. The results of this study indicate that the response profile of chemicals from public data provides useful information for modeling and evaluation purposes.

Impaired glucocorticoid action has been associated with immune disorders. Thus, there is an increasing interest to identify chemicals disrupting glucocorticoid action. The widely used flame retardant tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) was reported earlier to potently inhibit glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and moderately androgen receptor (AR) activity in yeast-based reporter gene assays. To further characterize possible GR disrupting effects of TBBPA, transactivation experiments using a human HEK-293 cell-based reporter gene assay and cell-free receptor binding experiments were performed in the present study. Both, transactivation and GR binding experiments failed to detect any activity of TBBPA on GR function. Molecular docking calculations supported this observation. Additionally, the current study could confirm the antiandrogenic activity of TBBPA seen in the yeast assay, although the effect was an order of magnitude less pronounced in the HEK-293 cell-based system. In conclusion, TBBPA does not directly affect GR function and, considering its rapid metabolism and low concentrations found in humans, it is unlikely to cause adverse effects by acting through AR.

Progesterone receptor (PR) signaling is involved in important reproductive functions and is a potential target for endocrine disrupting activities of DEHP and its metabolites. This study used in silico approaches for structural binding analyses of DEHP and its five indicated major metabolites with PR. Protein Data bank was searched to retrieve the crystal structure of human PR (Id: 1SQN). PubChem database was used to obtain the structures of DEHP and its five metabolites.

In summary, our results demonstrate that BPA exposure, like estradiol, increases HOXB9 expression in breast cells both in vitro and in vivo through a mechanism that involves increased recruitment of transcription and chromatin modification factors.",PMC4975976

Huge public health concern about endocrine disruptors has arisen. One of the mechanisms of endocrine disruption is through binding of endocrine disruptors with the hormone receptors in the target cells. Entrance of endocrine disruptors into target cells is the precondition of endocrine disruption. The binding capability of a chemical with proteins in the blood affects its entrance into the target cells and, thus, is very informative for the assessment of potential endocrine disruption of chemicals. α-fetoprotein is one of the major serum proteins that binds to a variety of chemicals such as estrogens. To better facilitate assessment of endocrine disruption of environmental chemicals, we developed a model for α-fetoprotein binding activity prediction using the novel pattern recognition method (Decision Forest) and the molecular descriptors calculated from two-dimensional structures by Mold² software. The predictive capability of the model has been evaluated through internal validation using 125 training chemicals (average balanced accuracy of 69%) and external validations using 22 chemicals (balanced accuracy of 71%). Prediction confidence analysis revealed the model performed much better at high prediction confidence. Our results indicate that the model is useful (when predictions are in high confidence) in endocrine disruption risk assessment of environmental chemicals though improvement by increasing number of training chemicals is needed.",PMC4847034
26934298,"Ulrike Klenke, Stephanie Constantin, Susan Wray",BPA Directly Decreases GnRH Neuronal Activity via Noncanonical Pathway.,2016,"Peripheral feedback of gonadal estrogen to the hypothalamus is critical for reproduction. Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental pollutant with estrogenic actions, can disrupt this feedback and lead to infertility in both humans and animals. GnRH neurons are essential for reproduction, serving as an important link between brain, pituitary, and gonads. Because GnRH neurons express several receptors that bind estrogen, they are potential targets for endocrine disruptors. However, to date, direct effects of BPA on GnRH neurons have not been shown. This study investigated the effects of BPA on GnRH neuronal activity using an explant model in which large numbers of primary GnRH neurons are maintained and express many of the receptors found in vivo. Because oscillations in intracellular calcium have been shown to correlate with electrical activity in GnRH neurons, calcium imaging was used to assay the effects of BPA. Exposure to 50μM BPA significantly decreased GnRH calcium activity. Blockage of γ-aminobutyric acid ergic and glutamatergic input did not abrogate the inhibitory BPA effect, suggesting direct regulation of GnRH neurons by BPA. In addition to estrogen receptor-β, single-cell RT-PCR analysis confirmed that GnRH neurons express G protein-coupled receptor 30 (G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1) and estrogen-related receptor-γ, all potential targets for BPA. Perturbation studies of the signaling pathway revealed that the BPA-mediated inhibition of GnRH neuronal activity occurred independent of estrogen receptors, GPER, or estrogen-related receptor-γ, via a noncanonical pathway. These results provide the first evidence of a direct effect of BPA on GnRH neurons.",PMC4870872

Some chemicals mimic natural endocrine hormones and, thus, have the potential to be endocrine disruptors. Most of these chemicals have never been tested for their ability to interact with the estrogen receptor (ER). Risk assessors need tools to prioritize chemicals for evaluation in costly in vivo tests, for instance, within the U.S. EPA Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. We describe a large-scale modeling project called CERAPP (Collaborative Estrogen Receptor Activity Prediction Project) and demonstrate the efficacy of using predictive computational models trained on high-throughput screening data to evaluate thousands of chemicals for ER-related activity and prioritize them for further testing. CERAPP combined multiple models developed in collaboration with 17 groups in the United States and Europe to predict ER activity of a common set of 32,464 chemical structures. Quantitative structure-activity relationship models and docking approaches were employed, mostly using a common training set of 1,677 chemical structures provided by the U.S. EPA, to build a total of 40 categorical and 8 continuous models for binding, agonist, and antagonist ER activity. All predictions were evaluated on a set of 7,522 chemicals curated from the literature. To overcome the limitations of single models, a consensus was built by weighting models on scores based on their evaluated accuracies. Individual model scores ranged from 0.69 to 0.85, showing high prediction reliabilities. Out of the 32,464 chemicals, the consensus model predicted 4,001 chemicals (12.3%) as high priority actives and 6,742 potential actives (20.8%) to be considered for further testing. This project demonstrated the possibility to screen large libraries of chemicals using a consensus of different in silico approaches.

Several studies have shown an association between p,p'-DDT exposure and reproductive abnormalities. To investigate the putative effects of p,p'-DDT on the human follitropin receptor (FSHR) function. We used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing human FSHR to investigate the impact of p,p'-DDT on FSHR activity and its interaction with the receptor. At a concentration of 5 μM p,p'-DDT increased the maximum response of the FSHR to follitropin by 32 ± 7.45%. However, 5 μM p,p'-DDT decreased the basal activity and did not influence the maximal response of the closely related LH/hCG receptor to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The potentiating effect of p,p'-DDT was specific for the FSHR. Moreover, in cells that did not express FSHR, p,p'-DDT had no effect on cAMP response. Thus, the potentiating effect of p,p'-DDT was dependent on the FSHR. In addition, p,p'-DDT increased the sensitivity of FSHR to hCG and to a low molecular weight agonist of the FSHR, 3-((5methyl)-2-(4-benzyloxy-phenyl)-5-{[2-[3-ethoxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-ethylcarbamoyl]-methyl}-4-oxo-thiazolidin-3-yl)-benzamide (16a). Basal activity in response to p,p'-DDT and potentiation of the FSHR response to FSH by p,p'-DDT varied among FSHR mutants with altered transmembrane domains (TMDs), consistent with an effect of p,p'-DDT via TMD binding. This finding was corroborated by the results of simultaneously docking p,p'-DDT and 16a into the FSHR transmembrane bundle. p,p'-DDT acted as a positive allosteric modulator of the FSHR in our experimental model.

The widespread use of SPs has resulted in the increased exposure to wild animals and humans. Recently, some SPs are suspected as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and have been assessed for their potential estrogenicity by adopting various analyzing assays. In this study, we examined the estrogenic effects of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC) and cypermethrin (CP), the most commonly used pesticides in Korea, using BG-1 ovarian cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). To evaluate the estrogenic activities of two SPs, LC and CP, we employed MTT assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in LC or CP treated BG-1 ovarian cancer cells. In MTT assay, LC (10(-6) M) and CP (10(-5) M) significantly induced the growth of BG-1 cancer cells. LC or CP-induced cell growth was antagonized by addition of ICI 182,720 (10(-8) M), an ER antagonist, suggesting that this effect appears to be mediated by an ER-dependent manner. Moreover, RT-PCR results showed that transcriptional level of cyclin D1, a cell cycle-regulating gene, was significantly up-regulated by LC and CP, while these effects were reversed by co-treatment of ICI 182,780. However, p21, a cyclin D-ckd-4 inhibitor gene, was not altered by LC or CP. Moreover, ERα expression was not significantly changed by LC and CP, while downregulated by E2. Finally, in xenografted mouse model transplanted with human BG-1 ovarian cancer cells, E2 significantly increased the tumor volume compare to a negative control, but LC did not. Taken together, these results suggest that LC and CP may possess estrogenic potentials by stimulating the growth of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells via partially ER signaling pathway associated with cell cycle as did E2, but this estrogenic effect was not found in in vivo mouse model.",PMC4751442

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of neonatal BPA exposure on the first wave of spermatogenesis. Newborn male mice were subcutaneously injected with BPA (0.01, 0.1 and 5 mg/kg body weight) daily from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 21. Histological analysis of testes at PND 22 revealed that BPA-treated testes contained mostly spermatogonia and spermatocytes with markedly less round spermatids, indicating signs of meiotic arrest. Terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that BPA treatment significantly increased the number of apoptotic germ cells per tubule, which corroborated the observation of meiotic arrest. In addition, BPA caused abnormal proliferation of germ cells as revealed by Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemical staining. Mechanistically, BPA-treated testes displayed a complete lack of BOULE expression, which is a conserved key regulator for spermatogenesis. Moreover, BPA significantly increased the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) α and β in the developing testis. The present study demonstrated that neonatal BPA exposure disrupted meiosis progression during the first wave of spermatogenesis, which may be, at least in part, due to inhibition of BOULE expression and/or up-regulation of ERα/β expression in BPA-exposed developing testis.",PMC4891144

Despite this ubiquitous and frequent exposure little is known about the potential toxicological effects, particularly with regard to the aromatic MO fractions. From a toxicological point of view the huge amount of alkylated and unsubstituted compounds therein is reason for concern as they can harbor genotoxicants as well as potential endocrine disruptors. The aim of this study was to assess both the genotoxic and estrogenic potential of MOs used in printing inks. Mineral oils with various aromatic hydrocarbon contents were tested using a battery of in vitro assays selected to address various endpoints such as estrogen-dependent cell proliferation, activation of estrogen receptor α or transcriptional induction of estrogenic target genes. In addition, the comet assay has been applied to test for genotoxicity. Out of 15 MOs tested, 10 were found to potentially act as xenoestrogens. For most of the oils the effects were clearly triggered by constituents of the aromatic hydrocarbon fraction. From 5 oils tested in the comet assay, 2 showed slight genotoxicity.

Kidney is an important target organ in DM accounting for the majority of patients requiring renal replacement therapy at dialysis units. Microalbuminuria (MA) has been a valuable tool to predict end-organ damage in DM but its low sensitivity has driven research efforts to seek other alternatives. Albumin is taken up by albumin receptors, megalin and cubilin in the proximal tubule epithelial cells. We demonstrated that insulin at physiological concentrations induce albumin endocytosis through activation of protein kinase B (Akt) in proximal tubule epithelial cells. Inhibition of Akt by a phosphorylation deficient construct abrogated insulin induced albumin endocytosis suggesting a role for Akt in insulin-induced albumin endocytosis. Furthermore we demonstrated a novel interaction between Akt substrate 160kDa (AS160) and cytoplasmic tail of megalin. Mice with type 1 DM (T1D) displayed decreased Akt, megalin, cubilin and AS160 expression in their kidneys in association with urinary cubilin shedding preceding significant MA. Patients with T1D who have developed MA in the EDC (The Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications) study demonstrated urinary cubilin shedding prior to development of MA. We hypothesize that perturbed insulin-Akt cascade in DM leads to alterations in trafficking of megalin and cubilin, which results in urinary cubilin shedding as a prelude to MA in early diabetic nephropathy. We propose that utilization of urinary cubilin shedding, as a urinary biomarker, will allow us to detect and intervene in diabetic nephropathy (DN) at an earlier stage.",PMC4605734

Bisphenol A (BPA; 4,4'-(propane-2,2-diyl)diphenol) and 4-tert-octylphenol (OP; 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol) are among the most common environmental contaminants possessing endocrine disruption properties and are present in plastics, epoxy resins, detergents and other commercial products of common personal and industrial use. A metabolite of BPA, 4-Methyl-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)pent-1-ene (MBP) is about 1000 times more biologically active compared to BPA. Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies have shown association of BPA and OP with adverse effects on male and female reproductive system in human and animals. The endocrine disruption activity can occur through multiple pathways including binding to steroid receptors. Androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PR) are critical for reproductive tract growth and function. Structural binding characterization of BPA, MBP, and OP with AR and PR using molecular docking simulation approaches revealed novel interactions of BPA with PR, and MBP and OP with AR and PR. For BPA, MBP, and OP, five AR interacting residues Leu-701, Leu-704, Asn-705, Met-742, and Phe-764 overlapped with those of native AR ligand testosterone, and four PR interacting residues Leu-715, Leu-718, Met-756, and Met-759 overlapped with those of PR co-complex ligand, norethindrone. For both the receptors the binding strength of MBP was maximum among the three compounds. Thus, these compounds have the potential to block or interfere in the binding of the endogenous native AR and PR ligands and, hence, resulting in dysfunction. The knowledge of the key interactions and the important amino-acid residues also allows better prediction of potential of xenobiotic molecules for disrupting AR- and PR-mediated pathways, thus, helping in design of less potent alternatives for commercial use.",PMC4574962

Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals have been found to suppress prostaglandin synthesis, but to our knowledge, pesticides have never been tested for these effects. We assessed the ability of pesticides that are commonly used in the European Union to suppress prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) synthesis. Changes in PGD2 secretion in juvenile mouse Sertoli cells (SC5 cells) were measured using an ELISA. Coincubation with arachidonic acid (AA) was conducted to determine the site of action in the PGD2 synthetic pathway. Molecular modeling studies were performed to assess whether pesticides identified as PGD2-active could serve as ligands of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) binding pocket. The pesticides boscalid, chlorpropham, cypermethrin, cyprodinil, fenhexamid, fludioxonil, imazalil (enilconazole), imidacloprid, iprodione, linuron, methiocarb, o-phenylphenol, pirimiphos-methyl, pyrimethanil, and tebuconazole suppressed PGD2 production. Strikingly, some of these substances-o-phenylphenol, cypermethrin, cyprodinil, linuron, and imazalil (enilconazole)-showed potencies (IC50) in the range between 175 and 1,500 nM, similar to those of analgesics intended to block COX enzymes. Supplementation with AA failed to reverse this effect, suggesting that the sites of action of these pesticides are COX enzymes. The molecular modeling studies revealed that the COX-2 binding pocket can accommodate most of the pesticides shown to suppress PGD2 synthesis. Some of these pesticides are also capable of antagonizing the androgen receptor. Chemicals with structural features more varied than previously thought can suppress PGD2 synthesis. Our findings signal a need for in vivo studies to establish the extent of endocrine-disrupting effects that might arise from simultaneous interference with PGD2 signaling and androgen action.

It is still not fully understood how AF-1 and AF-2 activities are regulated cooperatively by ligands. To evaluate the AF-1 involvement in the estrogenic activities of various compounds, we analyzed these transactivation functions using AF-1-truncated and AF-2-mutated ERα mutants. AF-2 is composed of two domains with flexible and static regions. We used an AF-2 flexible region mutant and an AF-2 static region mutant. Both mutants have been reported as non-E2 responsive due to disruption of E2-mediated coactivator recruitment to the AF-2. The AF-2 mutants were not activated by agonists, but surprisingly antagonists and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) activated the AF-2 mutants. This antagonist reversal activity was derived from AF-1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the AF-2 contains an AF-1 suppression function using C-terminal-truncated ERα mutants. From these findings we hypothesized that the mutation of AF-2 disrupted its ability to suppress AF-1, causing the antagonist reversal. To assess the AF-2-mediated AF-1 suppression, we analyzed the transcription activity of physically separated AF-1 and AF-2 using a novel hybrid reporter assay. We observed that the AF-1 activity was not suppressed by the physically separated AF-2. Furthermore, SERMs did not induce the AF-1-mediated activity from the separated mutant AF-2, which differed from the intact protein.

Crystal structures of PPARγ-LBD/TBT and PPARγ-LBD/TPT complexes were determined at 1.95 Å and 1.89 Å, respectively. Specific binding of organotins is achieved through non-covalent ionic interactions between the sulfur atom of Cys285 and the tin atom. Comparisons of the determined structures suggest that the strong activity of TPT arises through interactions with helix 12 of LBD primarily via π-π interactions.

Bulk imprinting was used to detect the endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) known as estradiols. The estrogen 17β-estradiol is one of the most potent EDCs, even at very low concentrations. A highly sensitive, selective and robust QCM sensor was fabricated for real time monitoring of 17β-estradiol in water samples by using molecular imprinted polyurethane. Optimization of porogen (pyrene) and cross-linker (phloroglucinol) levels leads to improved sensitivity, selectivity and response time of the estradiol sensor. Surface imprinting of polyurethane as sensor coating also allowed us to generate interaction sites for the selective recognition of bacteria, even in a very complex mixture of interfering compounds, while they were growing from their spores in nutrient solution. A double molecular imprinting approach was followed to transfer the geometrical features of natural bacteria onto the synthetic polymer to generate biomimetic bacteria. The use of biomimetic bacteria as template makes it possible to prepare multiple sensor coatings with similar sensitivity and selectivity. Thus, cell typing, e.g., differentiation of bacteria strains, bacteria growth profile and extent of their nutrition, can be monitored by biomimetic mass sensors. Obviously, this leads to controlled cell growth in bioreactors.",PMC4299071

In this study, the estrogenic potency induced by the binding of 17-beta-estradiol (E2), BPA, BPS, PES and their metabolites formed by the rat liver S9 fraction to the human estrogen receptor (ER) was estimated. We used an in vitro bioassay based on the luciferase reporter assay in MVLN cells to evaluate the estrogenic activity of 17-beta-estradiol (E2), BPA, BPS, PES (E2: 0.001 to 0.3 nM; BPA, BPS and PES: 0.0001 to 5 microM) and their metabolites (E2: 0.05 microM; BPA, BPS and PES: 0.1 mM) according to incubation times (0, 20 and 40 min). After chemical treatment to MVLN cells for 72 hrs, and the cell viability and luciferase intensity induced were estimated, from which the estrogenic activity of the chemicals tested was evaluated. BPA and BPS induced estrogenic activity whereas PES did not show any estrogenic activity in the concentrations tested. In an in vitro assay of metabolites, BPA metabolites displayed comparable estrogenic activity with BPA and metabolites of both BPS and PES showed increasing estrogenic activity. The results suggest that the metabolites of BPS and PES have estrogenic potential and the need for the assessment of both chemicals and their metabolites in other EDC evaluation studies.

Estrogen receptors (ERs) are particularly important protein targets and many EDCs are ER binders, capable of altering normal homeostatic transcription and signaling pathways. An estrogenic xenobiotic can bind ER as either an agonist or antagonist to increase or inhibit transcription, respectively. The receptor conformations in the complexes of ER bound with agonists and antagonists are different and dependent on interactions with co-regulator proteins that vary across tissue type. Assessment of chemical endocrine disruption potential depends not only on binding affinity to ERs, but also on changes that may alter the receptor conformation and its ability to subsequently bind DNA response elements and initiate transcription. Using both agonist and antagonist conformations of the ERα, we developed an in silico approach that can be used to differentiate agonist versus antagonist status of potential binders. The approach combined separate molecular docking models for ER agonist and antagonist conformations. The ability of this approach to differentiate agonists and antagonists was first evaluated using true agonists and antagonists extracted from the crystal structures available in the protein data bank (PDB), and then further validated using a larger set of ligands from the literature. The usefulness of the approach was demonstrated with enrichment analysis in data sets with a large number of decoy ligands. The performance of individual agonist and antagonist docking models was found comparable to similar models in the literature. When combined in a competitive docking approach, they provided the ability to discriminate agonists from antagonists with good accuracy, as well as the ability to efficiently select true agonists and antagonists from decoys during enrichment analysis. This approach enables evaluation of potential ER biological function changes caused by chemicals bound to the receptor which, in turn, allows the assessment of a chemical's endocrine disrupting potential. The approach can be used not only by regulatory authorities to perform risk assessments on potential EDCs but also by the industry in drug discovery projects to screen for potential agonists and antagonists.",PMC4251048

However, most of these compounds are chemically unrelated to natural hormones, so their binding modes and associated hormonal activities are hardly predictable. We conducted a correlative analysis of structural and functional data to gain insight into the mechanisms by which 12 members of representative families of pollutants bind to and activate the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. We used a battery of biochemical, structural, biophysical, and cell-based approaches to characterize the interaction between ERs and their environmental ligands. Our study revealed that the chemically diverse compounds bound to ERs via varied sets of protein-ligand interactions, reflecting their differential activities, binding affinities, and specificities. We observed xenoestrogens binding to both ERs-with affinities ranging from subnanomolar to micromolar values-and acting in a subtype-dependent fashion as full agonists or partial agonists/antagonists by using different combinations of the activation functions 1 and 2 of ERα and ERβ.

In addition, for the first time a QSAR model was developed to predict binding affinities of antagonists inhibiting the interaction of coactivators with the AF-2 domain of THRβ (R(2)=0.70). Furthermore, molecular docking studies were performed for a set of THRβ ligands (57 agonists and 15 antagonists of LBD, 210 antagonists of the AF-2 domain, supplemented by putative decoys/non-binders) using several THRβ structures retrieved from the Protein Data Bank. We found that two agonist-bound THRβ conformations could effectively discriminate their corresponding ligands from presumed non-binders. Moreover, one of the agonist conformations could discriminate agonists from antagonists. Finally, we have conducted virtual screening of a chemical library compiled by the EPA as part of the Tox21 program to identify potential THRβ-mediated EDCs using both QSAR models and docking.

Whole genome RNA sequencing was performed to assess gene expression in DDT-treated MSCs. MSCs exposed to DDT formed fewer colonies, suggesting a reduction in self-renewal potential. DDT enhanced both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, which was confirmed by increased mRNA expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), lipoprotein lipase (LpL), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), leptin, osteonectin, core binding factor 1 (CBFA1), and FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (c-Fos).

The coadministration of ICI 182,780 blocked the effects of DDT. RNA sequencing revealed 121 genes and noncoding RNAs to be differentially expressed in DDT-treated MSCs compared with controls cells. Human MSCs provide a powerful biological system to investigate and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of environmental agents on stem cells and human health.

Many EDCs elicit their toxic effects through nuclear hormone receptors, like the estrogen receptor α (ERα). In silico models can be used to prioritize chemicals for toxicological evaluation to reduce the amount of costly pharmacological testing and enable early alerts for newly designed compounds. However, many of the current computational models are overly dependent on the chemistry of known modulators and perform poorly for novel chemical scaffolds. Herein we describe the development of computational, three-dimensional multi-conformational pocket-field docking, and chemical-field docking models for the identification of novel EDCs that act via the ligand-binding domain of ERα. These models were highly accurate in the retrospective task of distinguishing known high-affinity ERα modulators from inactive or decoy molecules, with minimal training. To illustrate the utility of the models in prospective in silico compound screening, we screened a database of over 6000 environmental chemicals and evaluated the 24 top-ranked hits in an ERα transcriptional activation assay and a differential scanning fluorimetry-based ERα binding assay. Promisingly, six chemicals displayed ERα agonist activity (32nM-3.98μM) and two chemicals had moderately stabilizing effects on ERα. Two newly identified active compounds were chemically related β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonists, dobutamine, and ractopamine (a feed additive that promotes leanness in cattle and poultry), which are the first βAR agonists identified as activators of ERα-mediated gene transcription.

Two androgen reporter gene assays and the enhanced H295R steroidogenesis assay were added to that previous defined ITS. These assays had added value, as several estrogenic model compounds also elicited clear and potent antiandrogenic properties and in addition also showed effects on steroidogenesis that might potentiate their apparent estrogenic effects in vivo. Adding these assays, examining mechanisms of action for estrogenicity apart from ERα binding, gives a more complete and comprehensive assessment of the ability of test compounds to interfere with endocrine signaling.

The uterotrophic assay detects estrogen receptor agonists through increases in uterine weight. The advantages of the uterotrophic rat models (immature vs. adult ovariectomized) and exposure routes are discussed. Across 29 studies, relative differences in uterine weights in the vehicle control group and 17α-ethynylestradiol-positive control group were reasonably reproducible. The Hershberger assay detects androgen receptor (AR) agonists, antagonists, and 5α-reductase inhibitors through changes in accessory sex tissue (AST) weights. Across 23 studies, AST weights were relatively reproducible for the vehicle groups (baseline), testosterone propionate (TP) groups (androgenic response), and flutamide + TP groups (antiandrogenic response). In one laboratory, one and four compounds were positive in the androgenic and antiandrogenic portions of the assay, respectively. Each compound was also positive for AR binding. In the other laboratory, three compounds showed potential antiandrogenic activity, but each compound was negative for AR binding and did not fit the profile for 5α-reductase inhibition. These compounds induced hepatic enzymes that enhanced testosterone metabolism/clearance, resulting in lower testosterone and decreased capacity to maintain AST weights.

The current study aimed to develop a biologically relevant cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify EDCs that act as aromatase inhibitors (AIs), estrogen receptor (ER) agonists, and/or ER antagonists. The AroER tri-screen assay was developed by stable transfection of ER-positive, aromatase-expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells with an estrogen responsive element (ERE) driven luciferase reporter plasmid. The AroER tri-screen can identify: estrogenic EDCs, which increase luciferase signal without 17β-estradiol (E2); anti-estrogenic EDCs, which inhibit the E2-induced luciferase signal; and AI-like EDCs, which suppress a testosterone-induced luciferase signal. The assay was first optimized in a 96-well plate format and then miniaturized into a 1536-well plate format. The AroER tri-screen was demonstrated to be suitable for high-throughput screening in the 1536-well plate format, with a 6.9-fold signal-to-background ratio, a 5.4% coefficient of variation, and a screening window coefficient (Z-factor) of 0.78.

Two scenarios were investigated, one representative of average serum levels reported in European countries, the other in line with levels towards the high exposures. In both situations, the in vitro potency of the 22 selected AR antagonists was too low to produce combined AR antagonistic effects at the concentrations found in human serum, although the high exposure scenario came quite close to measurable effects.

The effects of estradiol, the estrogen-receptor (ER) antagonist ICI and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486 on BPA-induced adipogenesis were examined. The expression levels of key adipogenic factors were assessed. Treatment of preadipocytes with 1-50 μM BPA induced a dose-dependent increase in differentiation and lipid accumulation as determined by lipid staining and triacylglyceride quantification. BPA also induced expression of the adipogenic markers aP2, adipsin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and the CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins α and β. Co-treatment of cells with ICI inhibited the BPA-induced increase in aP2 levels, while treatment with ICI or estradiol alone had no effect. Treatment of cells with the GR antagonist RU486 had no effect on BPA-induced differentiation as evaluated by aP2 levels. This study is one of the first to show that BPA induces human adipocyte differentiation in the absence of exogenous glucocorticoid through a non-classical ER pathway rather than through GR activation.

However, endocrine-disrupting chemicals could interfere with CORT signalling beyond the disruption of hormone titres, including effects on receptors in different target tissues. In this study, we examined the effects of 6 weeks of exposure to a petroleum-laced diet (1% oil weight:food weight) on tissue mass and intracellular CORT receptors in liver, fat, muscle and kidney (metabolic tissues), spleen (an immune tissue) and testes (a reproductive tissue). In the laboratory, male house sparrows were fed either a 1% weathered crude oil (n = 12) or a control diet (n = 12); glucocorticoid receptors and mineralocorticoid receptors were quantified using radioligand binding assays. In oil-exposed birds, glucocorticoid receptors were lower in one metabolic tissue (liver), higher in another metabolic tissue (fat) and unchanged in four other tissues (kidney, muscle, spleen and testes) compared with control birds. We saw no differences in mineralocorticoid receptors between groups. We also saw a trend towards reduced mass of the testes in oil-exposed birds compared with controls, but no differences in fat, kidney, liver, muscle or spleen mass between the two groups. This is the first study to examine the effects of petroleum on CORT receptor density in more than one or two target tissues. Given that a chronic low dose of ingested petroleum can affect stress-induced CORT titres as well as receptor density, this demonstrates that oil can act at multiple levels to disrupt an animal's response to environmental stressors. This also highlights the potential usefulness of the stress response as a bioindicator of chronic crude oil exposure.",PMC4732471

However, the metabolism of BPAF in vivo and the estrogenic activity of its metabolites remain unknown. In the present study, we identified four metabolites including BPAF diglucuronide, BPAF glucuronide (BPAF-G), BPAF glucuronide dehydrated and BPAF sulfate in the urine of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. BPAF-G was further characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). After treatment with a single dose of BPAF, BPAF was metabolized rapidly to BPAF-G, as detected in the plasma of SD rats. Biotransformation of BPAF to BPAF-G was confirmed with human liver microsomes (HLM), and Vmax of glucuronidation for HLM was 11.6 nmol/min/mg. We also found that BPAF glucuronidation could be mediated through several human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, among which UGT2B7 showed the highest efficiency of glucuronidation. To explain the biological function of BPAF biotransformation, the estrogenic activities of BPAF and BPAF-G were evaluated in ER-positive breast cancer T47D and MCF7 cells. BPAF significantly stimulates ER-regulated gene expression and cell proliferation at the dose of 100 nM and 1 μM in breast cancer cells. However, BPAF-G did not show any induction of estrogenic activity at the same dosages, implying that formation of BPAF-G is a potential host defense mechanism against BPAF. Based on our study, biotransformation of BPAF to BPAF-G can eliminate BPAF-induced estrogenic activity, which is therefore considered as reducing the potential threat to human beings.",PMC3862725

Their utility to industry is derived from their high surface-area-to-volume ratios and physico-chemical properties distinct from their bulk counterparts, but the near-certainty that NPs will be released into the environment raises the possibility that they could present health risks to humans and wildlife. The thyroid hormones (THs), thyroxine, and 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3), are involved in development and metabolism in vertebrates including humans and frogs. Many of the processes of anuran metamorphosis are analogous to human post-embryonic development and disruption of TH action can have drastic effects. These shared features make the metamorphosis of anurans an excellent model for screening for endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). We used the cultured tailfin (C-fin) assay to examine the exposure effects of 0.1-10 nM (~8-800 ng/L) of three types of ~20 nm TiO2 NPs (P25, M212, M262) and micron-sized TiO2 (μ TiO2) ±10 nM T3. The actual Ti levels were 40.9-64.7% of the nominal value. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) was used to measure the relative amounts of mRNA transcripts encoding TH-responsive THs receptors (thra and thrb) and Rana larval keratin type I (rlk1), as well as the cellular stress-responsive heat shock protein 30 kDa (hsp30), superoxide dismutase (sod), and catalase (cat). The levels of the TH-responsive transcripts were largely unaffected by any form of TiO2. Some significant effects on stress-related transcripts were observed upon exposure to micron-sized TiO2, P25, and M212 while no effect was observed with M262 exposure. Therefore, the risk of adversely affecting amphibian tissue by disrupting TH-signaling or inducing cellular stress is low for these compounds relative to other previously-tested NPs.",PMC3836013

The identification of the classical receptors ERα and ERβ and the transmembrane receptor GPER and the resolution of the structure of the ligand bound to its receptor established the principal molecular mechanisms of estrogen action. The presence of estrogen-like compounds in many plants used in traditional medicine or ingested as food ingredients, phytoestrogens, as well as the estrogenic activities of many industrial pollutants and pesticides, xenoestrogens, have prompted investigations into their role in human health. Phyto- and xenoestrogens bind to the estrogen receptors with a lower affinity than the endogenous estrogens and can compete or substitute the hormone. Xenoestrogens, which accumulate in the body throughout life, are believed to increase breast cancer risk, especially in cases of prenatal and prepuberal exposure whereas the role of phytoestrogens is still a matter of debate. At present, the application of phytoestrogens appears to be limited to the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms in women where the production of endogenous estrogens has ceased. In this review we discuss chemistry, structure and classification, estrogen signaling and the consequences of the interactions of estrogens, phytoestrogens and xenoestrogens with their receptors, the complex interactions of endogenous and exogenous ligands, the evaluation of the health risks related to xenoestrogens, and the perspectives toward the synthesis of potent third generation selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).",PMC4153070

To evaluate this hypothesis, a screening system for obesogenic compounds is urgently needed. In this study, we suggest a standardised protocol for obesogen screening based on the 3T3-L1 cell line, a well-characterised adipogenesis model, and direct fluorescent measurement using Nile red lipid staining technique. In a first phase, we characterised the assay using the acknowledged obesogens rosiglitazone and tributyltin. Based on the obtained dose-response curves for these model compounds, a lipid accumulation threshold value was calculated to ensure the biological relevance and reliability of statistically significant effects. This threshold based method was combined with the well described strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) method for classification of non-, weak- or strong obesogenic compounds. In the next step, a range of EDCs, used in personal and household care products (parabens, musks, phthalates and alkylphenol compounds), were tested to further evaluate the obesogenicity screening assay for its discriminative power and sensitivity. Additionally, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) dependency of the positive compounds was evaluated using PPARγ activation and antagonist experiments. Our results showed the adipogenic potential of all tested parabens, several musks and phthalate compounds and bisphenol A (BPA).

Here we investigate the possibility that estrogens also impact splicing decisions on estrogen responsive genes, such as that encoding ERα itself. Targeted PCR cloning was applied to identify six ERα mRNA variants in zebrafish. Sequencing revealed alternate use of transcription and translation start sites, multiple exon deletions, intron retention and alternate polyadenylation. As determined by quantitative (q)PCR, N-terminal mRNA variants predicting long (ERαA(L)) and short (ERα(S)) isoforms were differentially expressed by tissue-type, sex, stage of development and estrogen exposure. Whereas ERα(L) mRNA was diffusely distributed in liver, brain, heart, eye, and gonads, ERα(S) mRNA was preferentially expressed in liver (female>male) and ovary. Neither ERα(L) nor ERα(S) transcripts varied significantly during development, but 17β-estradiol selectively increased accumulation of ERα(S) mRNA (∼170-fold by 120 hpf), an effect mimicked by bisphenol-A and diethylstilbestrol. Significantly, a C-truncated variant (ERα(S)-Cx) lacking most of the ligand binding and AF-2 domains was transcribed exclusively from the short isoform promoter and was similar to ERα(S) in its tissue-, stage- and estrogen inducible expression. These results support the idea that promoter choice and alternative splicing of the esr1 gene of zebrafish are part of the autoregulatory mechanism by which estrogen modulates subsequent ERα expression, and further suggest that environmental estrogens could exert some of their toxic effects by altering the relative abundance of structurally and functionally distinct ERα isoforms.",PMC3862120

As the actions of steroids are mediated through the binding of steroid receptors, most studies of EDCs have assumed that they too elicit their effects by binding steroid receptors. We tested an alternative hypothesis, namely that EDCs elicit their effects during embryonic development by disrupting the metabolism of maternally derived steroids, thereby allowing maternally derived steroids to bind steroid receptors and elicit effects. Specifically, we examined the ability of the EDC, bisphenol-A (BPA) to inhibit the normal metabolism of oestradiol during the first nine days of embryonic development in the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). We found that, when BPA was present, oestrogen metabolism was inhibited when compared to control eggs. In particular, the formation of oestrone sulfate was blocked in BPA-treated eggs. We postulate that the oestrogenic effects of EDCs may be driven, at least in part, by inappropriate oestrogen signalling. The retention of oestrogens at points of development when they would normally be metabolized to inactive forms might also help explain low-dose effects frequently reported for EDCs.",PMC3768319

We found that PCBs activate AR transcriptional activity and that this effect is potentiated by the demethylase Jarid1b, a histone demethylase that catalyzes the removal of trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), induced by PCB. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the treatment of cultured cells (HEK293) with a mixture of the most diffused environmental PCBs and, also with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on the functional interaction between AR and Jarid1b. Although the effect induced by DHT on the AR transactivation was considerably higher, the PCB mixture produced an AR-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Cotransfection with plasmids expressing Jarid1b and various AR isoforms containing polyglutamine tracts (polyQ tracts) of different lengths showed that Jarid1b potentiates the AR transcriptional activity induced by PCBs but only with the shortest AR isoform. The potentiating effect of Jarid1b on the AR is mediated by a direct interaction of the enzyme with the AR promoter. In fact, utilizing constructs containing AR promoters with a different length and a luciferase reporter gene, we showed that the effect of PCBs, but not of DHT, needs the presence of Jarid1b and of at least two DNA binding sites for Jarid1b.",PMC3891687

Treatments with 200 μg/kg bw/day of BPA and E2 significantly decreased sperm counts and inhibited spermiation, characterized by an increase in stage VII and decrease in stage VIII in the seminiferous epithelium. This was concomitant with a disruption in the progression of meiosis I and the persistence of meiotic DNA strand breaks in pachytene spermatocytes,and the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated and checkpoint kinase 2 signal pathway was also activated; Eventually, germ cell apoptosis was triggered as evaluated by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling assay and western blot for caspase 3. Using the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI 182780, we determined that ER signaling mediated BPA-induced meiotic disruption and reproductive impairment.

In several cell culture and animal models, As acts as an endocrine disruptor, which may underlie many of its health effects. Previous work showed that steroid receptor (SR)-driven gene expression is disrupted in cells treated with inorganic As (arsenite, iAs(+3)). In those studies, low iAs(+3) concentrations (0.1-0.7 μM) stimulated hormone-inducible transcription, whereas somewhat higher but still non-cytotoxic levels (1-3 μM) inhibited transcription. This investigation focuses on the mechanisms underlying these inhibitory effects and evaluates the role of methylated trivalent As metabolites on SR function. Recent evidence suggests that, compared with iAs, methylated forms may have distinct biochemical effects. Here, fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments utilizing purified, hormone-bound human glucocorticoid (GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) have demonstrated that neither inorganic (iAs(+3)) nor dimethylated (DMA(+3)) species of trivalent As affect receptor interactions with glucocorticoid DNA response elements (GREs). However, monomethylated forms (monomethylarsenite, MMA(+3) and monomethylarsonic diglutathione, MADG) strongly inhibit GR-GRE and PR-GRE binding. Additionally, speciation studies of iAs(+3)-treated H4IIE rat hepatoma cells show that, under treatment conditions that cause inhibition of hormone-inducible gene transcription, the intracellular concentration of MADG is sufficient to inhibit GR-GRE and PR-GRE interactions in vivo. These results indicate that arsenic's inhibitory endocrine disruption effects are probably caused in part by methylated metabolites' disruption of SR ability to bind DNA response elements that are crucial to hormone-driven gene transcription.",PMC3884051

Both single-task learning (STL) and multi-task learning (MTL) continuous quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed for predicting ligand binding affinity to ERα or ERβ. High predictive accuracy was achieved for ERα binding affinity (MTL R(2)=0.71, STL R(2)=0.73). For ERβ binding affinity, MTL models were significantly more predictive (R(2)=0.53, p<0.05) than STL models. In addition, docking studies were performed on a set of ER agonists/antagonists (67 agonists and 39 antagonists for ERα, 48 agonists and 32 antagonists for ERβ, supplemented by putative decoys/non-binders) using the following ER structures (in complexes with respective ligands) retrieved from the Protein Data Bank: ERα agonist (PDB ID: 1L2I), ERα antagonist (PDB ID: 3DT3), ERβ agonist (PDB ID: 2NV7), and ERβ antagonist (PDB ID: 1L2J).

The results showed that two receptors, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and androgen receptor (AR), are affected by BPA in opposite direction. To confirm the observed effects of BPA on ERα and AR, we performed transient transfection experiments with full-length receptors and their corresponding response elements linked to luciferase reporters. We also included in this study two BPA analogs, bisphenol AF (BPAF) and bisphenol S (BPS). As seen in African green monkey kidney CV1 cells, the present study confirmed that BPA and BPAF act as ERα agonists (half maximal effective concentration EC50 of 10-100 nM) and as AR antagonists (half maximal inhibitory concentration IC50 of 1-2 μM). Both BPA and BPAF antagonized AR function via competitive inhibition of the action of synthetic androgen R1881. BPS with lower estrogenic activity (EC50 of 2.2 μM), did not compete with R1881 for AR binding, when tested at 30 μM.

Previous studies have shown that the phenylsulfamide fungicide tolylfluanid (TF) augments glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-dependent luciferase expression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes while modulating insulin action in primary murine and human adipocytes. Studies were performed to interrogate glucocorticoid signaling in primary adipocytes exposed to TF. TF mimicked the gene transcription profile of the murine glucocorticoid corticosterone (Cort). Cellular fractionation assays demonstrated that TF treatment promoted the activating serine phosphorylation of GR, augmenting its cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation as well as its enrichment at glucocorticoid response elements on the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper gene promoter. After acute treatment, Cort or TF promoted insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) gene and protein expression. Either treatment also enriched GR binding at an identified glucocorticoid response element in the IRS-1 gene. TF or Cort each increased insulin-stimulated lipogenesis, an effect resulting from increased lipogenic gene expression and enhanced insulin-stimulated dephosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase. The augmentation of insulin-stimulated lipogenesis was mediated through a specific enhancement of Akt phosphorylation at T308. These findings support modulation of IRS-1 levels as a mechanism for glucocorticoid-mediated changes in insulin action in primary adipocytes. Albeit with less affinity than Cort, in silico analysis suggests that TF can interact with the ligand binding pocket of GR.

In this study we used U.S. EPA ToxCast HTS assays for estrogen, androgen, steroidogenic, and thyroid-disrupting mechanisms to classify compounds and compare ToxCast results to in vitro and in vivo data from EDSP T1S assays. We implemented an iterative model that optimized the ability of endocrine-related HTS assays to predict components of EDSP T1S and related results. Balanced accuracy was used as a measure of model performance.

Their intended mechanism is prolonged sodium channel opening, but recent studies reveal that pyrethroids such as permethrin and bifenthrin also have endocrine activity. Additionally, metabolites may have greater endocrine activity than parent compounds. The authors evaluated the in vivo concentration-dependent ability of bifenthrin and permethrin to induce choriogenin (an estrogen-responsive protein) in Menidia beryllina, a fish species known to reside in pyrethroid-contaminated aquatic habitats. The authors then compared the in vivo response with an in vitro assay--chemical activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX). Juvenile M. beryllina exposed to bifenthrin (1, 10, 100 ng/L), permethrin (0.1, 1, 10 µg/L), and ethinylestradiol (1, 10, 50 ng/L) had significantly higher ng/mL choriogenin (Chg) measured in whole body homogenate than controls. Though Chg expression in fish exposed to ethinylestradiol (EE2) exhibited a traditional sigmoidal concentration response, curves fit to Chg expressed in fish exposed to pyrethroids suggest a unimodal response, decreasing slightly as concentration increases. Whereas the in vivo response indicated that bifenthrin and permethrin or their metabolites act as estrogen agonists, the CALUX assay demonstrated estrogen antagonism by the pyrethroids. The results, supported by evidence from previous studies, suggest that bifenthrin and permethrin, or their metabolites, appear to act as estrogen receptor (ER) agonists in vivo, and that the unmetabolized pyrethroids, particularly bifenthrin, act as an ER antagonists in cultured mammalian cells.",PMC3529915

Paraben esters and their salts are widely used as preservatives in cosmetics, toiletries, food, and pharmaceuticals. Humans are exposed to parabens through the use of such products from dermal contact, ingestion, and inhalation. However, research on the effects of parabens on health is limited, and the effects of parabens on adipogenesis have not been systematically studied. Here, we report that (1) parabens promote adipogenesis (or adipocyte differentiation) in murine 3T3-L1 cells, as revealed by adipocyte morphology, lipid accumulation, and mRNA expression of adipocyte-specific markers; (2) the adipogenic potency of parabens is increased with increasing length of the linear alkyl chain in the following potency ranking order: methyl- < ethyl- < propyl- < butylparaben. The extension of the linear alkyl chain with an aromatic ring in benzylparaben further augments the adipogenic ability, whereas 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, the common metabolite of all parabens, and the structurally related benzoic acid (without the OH group) are inactive in promoting 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation; (3) parabens activate glucocorticoid receptor and/or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes; however, no direct binding to, or modulation of, the ligand binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor by parabens was detected by glucocorticoid receptor competitor assays; and lastly, (4) parabens, butyl- and benzylparaben in particular, also promote adipose conversion of human adipose-derived multipotent stromal cells.

The widespread exposure of individuals to BPA is suspected to affect a variety of physiological functions, including reproduction, development, and metabolism. Here we report that the mechanisms by which BPA and two congeners, bisphenol AF and bisphenol C (BPC), bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ER) α and β differ from that used by 17β-estradiol. We show that bisphenols act as partial agonists of ERs by activating the N-terminal activation function 1 regardless of their effect on the C-terminal activation function 2, which ranges from weak agonism (with BPA) to antagonism (with BPC). Crystallographic analysis of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs reveals two discrete binding modes, reflecting the different activities of compounds on ERs. BPA and 17β-estradiol bind to ERs in a similar fashion, whereas, with a phenol ring pointing toward the activation helix H12, the orientation of BPC accounts for the marked antagonist character of this compound. Based on structural data, we developed a protocol for in silico evaluation of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs or other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, such as estrogen-related receptor γ and androgen receptor, which are two known main targets of bisphenols. Overall, this study provides a wealth of tools and information that could be used for the development of BPA substitutes devoid of nuclear hormone receptor-mediated activity and more generally for environmental risk assessment.",PMC3443136

However, the detailed mechanism(s) by which DDT affects cellular physiology remains incompletely defined. We and others have shown that DDT activates cell-signaling cascades, culminating in the activation of estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent gene expression. Here, we identify a mechanism by which DDT alters cellular signaling and gene expression, independent of the estrogen receptor. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction array analysis of gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using either estradiol (E₂) or o,p´-DDT to identify distinct cellular gene expression responses. To elucidate the mechanisms by which DDT regulates cell signaling, we used molecular and pharmacological techniques. E₂ and DDT treatment both altered the expression of many of the genes assayed, but up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was observed only after DDT treatment, and this increase was not affected by the pure estrogen receptor α antagonist ICI 182780. Furthermore, DDT increased activation of the HIF-1 response element (HRE), a known enhancer of the VEGFA gene. This DDT-mediated increase in HRE activity was augmented by the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein) and was dependent on the p38 pathway. DDT up-regulated the expression of several genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were not altered by treatment with E₂, including VEGFA. We propose that this DDT-initiated, ER-independent stimulation of gene expression is due to DDT's ability to initiate crosstalk between MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways and transcriptional coactivators.",PMC3440107

It has been speculated that these compounds may also perturb epigenetic mechanisms and thus contribute to the early origin of adult onset disease. We hypothesised that histone methylation may be a component of the epigenome that is susceptible to perturbation. We used coexpression analysis of publicly available data to investigate the combinatorial actions of nuclear receptors and genes involved in histone methylation in normal testis and when faced with endocrine disruptor compounds. The expression patterns of a set of genes were profiled across testis tissue in human, rat and mouse, plus control and exposed samples from four toxicity experiments in the rat. Our results indicate that histone methylation events are a more general component of nuclear receptor mediated transcriptional regulation in the testis than previously appreciated. Coexpression patterns support the role of a gatekeeper mechanism involving the histone methylation modifiers Kdm1, Prdm2, and Ehmt1 and indicate that this mechanism is a common determinant of transcriptional integrity for genes critical to diverse physiological endpoints relevant to endocrine disruption. Coexpression patterns following exposure to vinclozolin and dibutyl phthalate suggest that coactivity of the demethylase Kdm1 in particular warrants further investigation in relation to endocrine disruptor mode of action. This study provides proof of concept that a bioinformatics approach that profiles genes related to a specific hypothesis across multiple biological settings can provide powerful insight into coregulatory activity that would be difficult to discern at an individual experiment level or by traditional differential expression analysis methods.",PMC3319570

These effects may lead to the disruption of major regulatory mechanisms, the onset of developmental disorders, and carcinogenesis. Especially, among diverse EDCs, xenoestrogens such as bisphenol A, dioxins, and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, have been shown to activate estrogen receptors (ERs) and to modulate cellular functions induced by ERs. Furthermore, they appear to be closely related with carcinogenicity in estrogen-dependant cancers, including breast, ovary, and prostate cancers. In in vivo animal models, prenatal exposure to xenoestrogens changed the development of the mouse reproductive organs and increased the susceptibility to further carcinogenic exposure and tumor occurence in adults. Unlike EDCs, which are chemically synthesized, several phytoestrogens such as genistein and resveratrol showed chemopreventive effects on specific cancers by contending with ER binding and regulating normal ER action in target tissues of mice. These results support the notion that a diet containing high levels of phytoestrogens can have protective effects on estrogen-related diseases. In spite of the diverse evidences of EDCs and phytoestrogens on causation and prevention of estrogen-dependant cancers provided in this article, there are still disputable questions about the dose-response effect of EDCs or chemopreventive potentials of phytoestrogens. As a wide range of EDCs including phytoestrogens have been remarkably increasing in the environment with the rapid growth in our industrial society and more closely affecting human and wildlife, the potential risks of EDCs in endocrine disruption and carcinogenesis are important issues and needed to be verified in detail.",PMC3251756

Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including BPA, have been shown to activate the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that functions as a master regulator of xenobiotic metabolism. However, the detailed mechanism by which these chemicals activate PXR remains unknown. We investigated the mechanism by which BPA interacts with and activates PXR and examined selected BPA analogues to determine whether they bind to and activate PXR. Cell-based reporter assays, in silico ligand-PXR docking studies, and site-directed mutagenesis were combined to study the interaction between BPA and PXR. We also investigated the influence of BPA and its analogues on the regulation of PXR target genes in human LS180 cells. We found that BPA and several of its analogues are potent agonists for human PXR (hPXR) but do not affect mouse PXR activity. We identified key residues within hPXR's ligand-binding pocket that constitute points of interaction with BPA. We also deduced the structural requirements of BPA analogues that activate hPXR. BPA and its analogues can also induce PXR target gene expression in human LS180 cells. The present study advances our understanding of the mechanism by which BPA interacts with and activates human PXR. Activation of PXR by BPA may explain some of the adverse effects of BPA in humans.",PMC3295358

They are easily released from plastics into the environment and can be found in measurable levels in human fluids. Phthalates are agonists for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), through which they regulate translocator protein (TSPO; 18 kDa) transcription in a tissue-specific manner. TSPO is a drug- and cholesterol-binding protein involved in mitochondrial respiration, steroid formation, and cell proliferation. TSPO has been shown to increase during differentiation and decrease during maturation in mouse adipocytes. The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) on the differentiation of human SW 872 preadipocyte cells, and examine the role of TSPO in the process. After 4 days of treatment with 10 µM MEHP, we observed changes in the transcription of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase, glucose transporters 1 and 4, and the S100 calcium binding protein B, all of which are markers of preadipocyte differentiation. These observed gene expression changes coincided with a decrease in cellular proliferation without affecting cellular triglyceride content. Taken together, these data suggest that MEHP exerts a differentiating effect on human preadipocytes. Interestingly, MEHP was able to temporarily increase TSPO mRNA levels through the PPAR-α and β/δ pathways. These results suggest that TSPO can be considered an important player in the differentiation process itself, or alternatively a factor whose presence is essential for adipocyte development.",PMC3244402

Here, we attempted to evaluate the effect of DES as an environmental endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) upon fish oocyte maturation using live zebrafish. DES triggered oocyte maturation within several hours in vivo when administrated directly into the surrounding water. The natural teleost maturation-inducing hormone, 17alpha, 20beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17,20beta-DHP) also induced oocyte maturation in vivo. Steroids such as testosterone, progesterone or 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were also effective in vivo. Further studies indicated that externally applied 17,20beta-DHP even induced ovulation. In contrast to 17,20beta -DHP, DES induced maturation but not ovulation. Theoretically this assay system provides a means to distinguish pathways involved in the induction of ovulation, which are known to be induced by genomic actions from the pathway normally involved in the induction of oocyte maturation, a typical non-genomic action-dependent pathway. In summary, we have demonstrated the effect of EDCs on fish oocyte maturation in vivo. To address the effects, we have explored a conceptually new approach to distinguish between the genomic and non-genomic actions induced by steroids. The assay can be applied to screens of progestin-like effects upon oocyte maturation and ovulation for small molecules of pharmacological agents or EDCs.",PMC3182199

The specific objectives of the current study were to determine (1) whether female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) experience alterations in endocrine function when exposed to sediments collected from agriculturally intense watersheds and (2) if these sediments display anti-estrogenic activity in an in vitro assay. In addition, sediment samples were analyzed for the presence of steroid hormones and pesticides associated with local agricultural practices. To accomplish this, sediments and water were collected from three sites within two agriculturally intense Nebraska watersheds (Bow Creek and the Elkhorn River). In 2009, minnows were exposed to sediment and/or water collected from the two Bow Creek sites (East Bow Creek and the Confluence) in the laboratory, while in 2010, minnows were exposed to sediment and/or water from East Bow Creek, the Confluence and the Elkhorn River. Following the 7-day exposure period, the hepatic mRNA expression of two-estrogen responsive genes, estrogen receptor α (ERα) and vitellogenin (Vtg) was determined. In 2009, females exposed to Confluence sediments, in the presence of laboratory water or Confluence water, experienced significant reductions in ERα expression relative to unexposed and Confluence water-exposed females. The defeminization of these females suggests the presence of a biologically available anti-estrogenic compound in sediments collected from this site. In 2010, sediments were assessed for anti-estrogenic activity on days 0 and 7 of the exposure period using a 4-h yeast estrogen screen. Lipophilic extracts (LEs) of day 0 sediments collected from the Confluence and the Elkhorn River induced significant reductions in the estrogenic reporter activity of treated yeast cultures suggesting the presence of a lipophilic anti-estrogenic compound in these extracts.

We investigated whether BPA and its halogenated analogs could be ligands of estrogen receptors (ERs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We studied the activity of compounds using reporter cell lines expressing ERs and PPARs. We measured the binding affinities to PPARγ by competitive binding assays with [3H]-rosiglitazone and investigated the impact of TBBPA and TCBPA on adipocyte differentiation using NIH3T3-L1 cells.

To better understand how AHR activation affects pregnancy-associated mammary gland differentiation, we used a combination of ex vivo differentiation, mammary epithelial transplantation, and AHR-deficient mice to determine whether AHR modulates mammary development through a direct effect on mammary epithelial cells (MECs) or by altering paracrine or systemic factors that drive pregnancy-associated differentiation. Studies using mutant mice that express an AHR protein lacking the DNA-binding domain show that defects in pregnancy-associated differentiation require AHR:DNA interactions. We then used fluorescence-based cell sorting to compare changes in gene expression in MECs and whole mammary tissue to gain insight into affected signaling pathways. Our data indicate that activation of the AHR during pregnancy directly affects mammary tissue development via both a direct effect on MECs and through changes in cells of the fat pad, and point to gene targets in MECs and stromal tissues as putative AHR targets.",PMC3099582

The human CAR gene undergoes multiple alternative splicing events resulting in the CAR2 and CAR3 variant receptors. Recent studies from our laboratory show that CAR2 is potently and specifically activated by di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). We hypothesized that alternative splicing is a mechanism for increasing CAR's functional diversity, broadening the human receptors' repertoire of response to environmental xenobiotics.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is one stromal ECM component that is known to facilitate tumor progression by enhancing invasion, growth, and angiogenesis(1). Interaction of HA with its cell surface receptor CD44 induces signaling events that promote tumor cell growth, survival, and migration, thereby increasing metastatic spread(2-3). HA is an anionic, nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating units of D-glucuronic acid and D-N-acetylglucosamine. Due to the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on repeating disaccharide units, native HA is largely hydrophilic and amenable to chemical modifications that introduce sulfate groups for photoreative immobilization (4-5). Previous studies involving the immobilizations of HA onto surfaces utilize the bioresistant behavior of HA and its sulfated derivative to control cell adhesion onto surfaces(6-7). In these studies cell adhesion preferentially occurs on non-HA patterned regions. To analyze cellular interactions with exogenous HA, we have developed patterned functionalized surfaces that enable a controllable study and high-resolution visualization of cancer cell interactions with HA. We utilized microcontact printing (uCP) to define discrete patterned regions of HA on glass surfaces. A ""tethering"" approach that applies carbodiimide linking chemistry to immobilize HA was used (8). Glass surfaces were microcontact printed with an aminosilane and reacted with a HA solution of optimized ratios of EDC and NHS to enable HA immobilization in patterned arrays. Incorporating carbodiimide chemistry with mCP enabled the immobilization of HA to defined regions, creating surfaces suitable for in vitro applications. Both colon cancer cells and breast cancer cells implicitly interacted with the HA micropatterned surfaces. Cancer cell adhesion occurred within 24 hours with proliferation by 48 hours. Using HA micropatterned surfaces, we demonstrated that cancer cell adhesion occurs through the HA receptor CD44.

Using cell-based transfection and transduction experiments, mass spectrometry, and organotypic assays together with molecular modeling, we investigated whether inhibition of the PG pathway by known EDCs could be a novel point of endocrine disruption. We found that many known EDCs inhibit the PG pathway in a mouse Sertoli cell line and in human primary mast cells. The EDCs also reduced PG synthesis in ex vivo rat testis, and this reduction was correlated with a reduced testosterone production. The inhibition of PG synthesis occurred without involvement of canonical PG receptors or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which have previously been described as targets of EDCs. Instead, our results suggest that the compounds may bind directly into the active site of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby obstructing the conversion of arachidonic acid to PG precursors without interfering with the expression of the COX enzymes. A common feature of the PG inhibitory EDCs is the presence of aromatic groups that may stabilize binding in the hydrophobic active site of the COX enzymes. Our findings suggest a hitherto unknown mode of action by EDCs through inhibition of the PG pathway and suggest new avenues to investigate effects of EDCs on reproductive and immunological disorders that have become increasingly common in recent decades.",PMC3080937

A complete understanding of how these compounds affect health is complicated because environmental estrogens are a structurally heterogeneous group of compounds. In this work, computational molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to predict the binding affinity of different compounds using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) estrogen receptors (ERs) as a model. Specifically, this study presents a comparison of the binding affinity of the natural ligand estradiol-17β to the four rainbow trout ER isoforms with that of three known environmental estrogens 17α-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, and raloxifene. Two additional compounds, atrazine and testosterone, that are known to be very weak or non-binders to ERs were tested. The binding affinity of these compounds to the human ERα subtype is also included for comparison. The results of this study suggest that, when compared to estradiol-17β, bisphenol A binds less strongly to all four receptors, 17α-ethinylestradiol binds more strongly, and raloxifene has a high affinity for the α subtype only. The results also show that atrazine and testosterone are weak or non-binders to the ERs. All of the results are in excellent qualitative agreement with the known in vivo estrogenicity of these compounds in the rainbow trout and other fishes. Computational estimation of binding affinities could be a valuable tool for predicting the impact of environmental estrogens in fish and other animals.",PMC3022107

Many putative EDs are widely used in commercial products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) such as food packaging materials, ingredients of cosmetics, medical and dental devices, and drugs. The Endocrine Disruptor Knowledge Base (EDKB) project was initiated in the mid 1990's by the FDA as a resource for the study of EDs. The EDKB database, a component of the project, contains data across multiple assay types for chemicals across a broad structural diversity. This paper demonstrates the utility of EDKB database, an integral part of the EDKB project, for understanding and prioritizing EDs for testing. The EDKB database currently contains 3,257 records of over 1,800 EDs from different assays including estrogen receptor binding, androgen receptor binding, uterotropic activity, cell proliferation, and reporter gene assays. Information for each compound such as chemical structure, assay type, potency, etc. is organized to enable efficient searching. A user-friendly interface provides rapid navigation, Boolean searches on EDs, and both spreadsheet and graphical displays for viewing results. The search engine implemented in the EDKB database enables searching by one or more of the following fields: chemical structure (including exact search and similarity search), name, molecular formula, CAS registration number, experiment source, molecular weight, etc. The data can be cross-linked to other publicly available and related databases including TOXNET, Cactus, ChemIDplus, ChemACX, Chem Finder, and NCI DTP. The EDKB database enables scientists and regulatory reviewers to quickly access ED data from multiple assays for specific or similar compounds. The data have been used to categorize chemicals according to potential risks for endocrine activity, thus providing a basis for prioritizing chemicals for more definitive but expensive testing.

Estrogen-like actions are mediated via the nuclear hormone receptor activity of estrogen receptor (ER)α and ERβ and rapid regulation of intracellular signaling cascades. Previous study defined cerebellar granule cell neurons as estrogen responsive and that granule cell precursor viability was developmentally sensitive to estrogens. In this study experiments using Western blot analysis and pharmacological approaches have characterized the receptor and signaling modes of action of selective and nonselective estrogen ligands in developing cerebellar granule cells. Estrogen treatments were found to briefly increase ERK1/2-phosphorylation and then cause prolonged depression of ERK1/2 activity. The sensitivity of granule cell precursors to estrogen-induced cell death was found to require the integrated activation of membrane and intracellular ER signaling pathways. The sensitivity of granule cells to selective and nonselective ER agonists and a variety of estrogenic and nonestrogenic EDCs was also examined. The ERβ selective agonist DPN, but not the ERα selective agonist 4,4',4'-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol or other ERα-specific ligands, stimulated cell death. Only EDCs with selective or nonselective ERβ activities like daidzein, equol, diethylstilbestrol, and bisphenol A were observed to induce E2-like neurotoxicity supporting the conclusion that estrogen sensitivity in granule cells is mediated via ERβ. The presented results also demonstrate the utility of estrogen sensitive developing granule cells as an in vitro assay for elucidating rapid estrogen-signaling mechanisms and to detect EDCs that act at ERβ to rapidly regulate intracellular signaling.",PMC2999500

Several of these contaminants that are not able to bind to mammalian estrogen receptors (such as atrazine and cyanazine) have previously been reported to bind to the alligator estrogen receptor from oviductal tissue. Binding of known Lake Apopka contaminants to full length estrogen receptors alpha from human (hERalpha) and alligator (aERalpha) was assessed in a side-by-side comparison within the same assay system. Baculovirus-expressed recombinant hERalpha and aERalpha were used in a competitive binding assay. Atrazine and cyanazine were not able to bind to either receptor. p,p'-Dicofol was able to bind to aERalpha with a concentration inhibiting 50% of binding (IC50) of 4 microM, while only partially displacing 17beta-estradiol (E2) from hERalpha and yielding a projected IC50 of 45 microM. Chemicals that only partially displaced E2 from either receptor, including some dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolites and trans-nonachlor, appeared to have higher affinity for aERalpha than hERalpha. p,p'-Dicofol-mediated transcriptional activation through aERalpha and hERalpha was assessed to further explore the preferential binding of p,p'-dicofol to aERalpha over hERalpha. p,p'-Dicofol was able to stimulate transcriptional activation in a similar manner with both receptors. However, the in vitro results obtained with p,p'-dicofol were not reflected in an in vivo mammalian model, where Kelthane (mixed o,p'- and p,p'-dicofol isomers) did not elicit estrogenic effects.

The effects of TCC were studied in the freshwater mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. Specimens were exposed to concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 10.5 microg/L dissolved TCC and were removed and dissected, and embryos contained within the brood pouch were counted and classified as shelled or unshelled after two and four weeks of exposure. After four weeks, environmentally relevant TCC concentrations of 1.6 to 10.5 microg/L resulted in statistically significant increases in the number of unshelled embryos, whereas 0.2, 1.6, and 10.5 microg/L exposures significantly increased numbers of shelled embryos. The lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) was 0.2 microg/L, the no observed effect concentration (NOEC) was 0.05 microg/L; the 10% effective concentration (EC10) and the median effective concentration (EC50) for unshelled effects were 0.5 microg/L and 2.5 microg/L, respectively. Given the widespread occurrence of TCC in the environment and the effects shown at environmentally relevant concentrations, these results indicate that TCC may be causing reproductive effects in the environment.

PCB153 is one of the most commonly found polychlorinated biphenyls, and based on epidemiological studies, has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. The endocrine disruptor PCB153 has been reported to bind the estrogen receptor alpha, induce vessel formation, and increase the formation of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells. Since PCB153-induced phenotypic changes are similar to estradiol, we postulated that PCB153 activates redox signaling pathways common to 17β-estradiol. Whether the effect of PCB153 on the proteome is comparable to 17β-estradiol is not known. Therefore we investigated the proteome of human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to PCB153 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Using 2D DIGE coupled to MALDI-time of flight (TOF)/TOF MS, we found 96 protein spots significantly (greater than 1.5-fold) modulated by experimental treatments. Mass spectrometry identified 11 of 13 protein spots with high confidence protein score CI that was greater than 95%. Of the identified proteins, lamin A/C and far upstream element-binding protein (FUBP1) were regulated similarly by both treatments. FUBP1 is of particular interest because it controls c-myc. While lamin A/C modulates transcription factor AP-1 function. Interestingly, both c-myc and AP-1 are redox-sensitive transcription factors known to regulate genes required for cell growth. Network analysis of these proteins showed transforming growth factor β-1 and c-myc to play central roles. While our findings do not reveal any mechanisms involved in PCB153-induced vascularization, the identified network does provide a potential target pathway for further mechanistic studies of these relationships.",PMC3226797

In particular, some dispersants contain nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), which can degrade to nonylphenol (NP), a known endocrine disruptor. Given the urgent need to generate toxicity data, we carried out a series of in vitro high-throughput assays on eight commercial dispersants. These assays focused on the estrogen and androgen receptors (ER and AR), but also included a larger battery of assays probing other biological pathways. Cytotoxicity in mammalian cells was also quantified. No activity was seen in any AR assay. Two dispersants showed a weak ER signal in one assay (EC50 of 16 ppm for Nokomis 3-F4 and 25 ppm for ZI-400). NPs and NPEs also had a weak signal in this same ER assay.

However, the exact molecular events leading to reproductive dysfunctions as a result of arsenic exposure are yet to be ascertained. This report evaluates the effect and mode of action of chronic oral arsenic exposure on the uterine physiology of mature female albino rats. The effect of chronic oral exposure to arsenic at the dose of 4 microg/ml for 28 days was evaluated on adult female albino rats. Hematoxylin-eosin double staining method evaluated the changes in the histological architecture of the uterus. Circulating levels of gonadotropins and estradiol were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of the estrogen receptor and estrogen-induced genes was studied at the mRNA level by RT-PCR and at the protein level by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Sodium arsenite treatment decreased circulating levels of estradiol in a dose and time-dependent manner, along with decrease in the levels of both LH and FSH. Histological evaluation revealed degeneration of luminal epithelial cells and endometrial glands in response to arsenic treatment, along with reduction in thickness of the longitudinal muscle layer. Concomitantly, downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER alpha), the estrogen-responsive gene - vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and G1 cell cycle proteins, cyclin D1 and CDK4, was also observed. Together, the results indicate that arsenic disrupted the circulating levels of gonadotropins and estradiol, led to degeneration of luminal epithelial, stromal and myometrial cells of the rat uterus and downregulated the downstream components of the estrogen signaling pathway. Since development and functional maintenance of the uterus is under the influence of estradiol, arsenic-induced structural degeneration may be attributed to the reduction in circulating estradiol levels. Downregulation of the estrogen receptor and estrogen-responsive genes in response to arsenic indicates a mechanism of suppression of female reproductive functions by an environmental toxicant that is contra-mechanistic to that of estrogen.",PMC2909245

Analysis of mice carrying an estrogen response element luciferase reporter, ER-regulated genes in the mouse uterus, and eNOS enzyme activation further indicated that EDC specifically targets non-nuclear processes in vivo. In mice, estradiol and EDC equally stimulated carotid artery reendothelialization in an ERalpha- and G protein-dependent manner, and both agents attenuated the development of neointimal hyperplasia following endothelial injury. In contrast, endometrial carcinoma cell growth in vitro and uterine enlargement and MCF-7 cell breast cancer xenograft growth in vivo were stimulated by estradiol but not EDC. Thus, EDC is a non-nuclear selective ER modulator (SERM) in vivo, and in mice, non-nuclear ER signaling promotes cardiovascular protection.

We have previously described a killifish population resident in a highly polluted Superfund site (New Bedford Harbor, NBH) that shows evidence of exposure to an estrogenic environment and endocrine disruption. Here, we compare NBH with a local reference population (Scorton Creek, SC) for developmental patterns and direct effects of exogenous estradiol on the estrogenic markers, brain cytochrome P450 aromatase (CYP19A2 or AroB), hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg), and hepatic estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha). In contrast to our previous observation of elevated ER alpha in NBH embryos, developmental levels of AroB and Vtg mRNAs did not differ between the two sites, demonstrating that not all estrogen-responsive genes are upregulated in NBH embryos. A dose-response experiment showed that NBH larvae are less responsive (lower maximum induction, as measured by ER alpha) and less sensitive (higher EC(50) for induction, as measured by AroB) to estradiol than SC larvae, changes that would be adaptive in an estrogenic environment. In contrast, induction of Vtg mRNA is similar in the two populations, indicating that the adaptive mechanism is target gene-specific. Based on the lower basal levels of ER alpha mRNA in several tissues from adult NBH fish vs SC fish (Greytak and Callard, 2007), we predicted estrogen hyporesponsiveness; however, induction of ER alpha by estradiol exposure in reproductively inactive males did not differ between the two sites. Moreover, AroB was more responsive and Vtg induction was greater (2d) or similar (5d) in NBH as compared to SC males. Worth noting is the high inter-individual variability in estrogen responses of gene targets, especially in NBH killifish, which may indicate evolving preadaptive or adaptive mechanisms. In conclusion, although multi-generational exposure to a highly polluted environment is associated with changes in basal levels of ER alpha mRNA, this is not a simple predictor of estrogen responsiveness. We hypothesize that adaptation of killifish to the estrogenic and polluted environment may be occurring through diverse mechanisms that are gene-, tissue type- and life-stage-specific.",PMC2907899

A cross linker EDC was used to covalently conjugate fVII protein to SnCe6, and the binding activity and phototoxicity was confirmed by ELISA and in vitro PDT. The efficacy of fVII-tPDT was assessed in vitro by crystal violet staining assay and in vivo by measuring tumor size in mice carrying murine or human breast cancer xenografts.

The reason for targeting receptor TF for the development of tPDT is that TF is a common but specific target on angiogenic tumour vascular endothelial cells (VEC) and many types of tumour cells, including solid tumours and leukaemia. Murine factor VII protein (mfVII) containing a mutation (Lys341Ala) was covalently conjugated via a cross linker EDC with Veterporfin (VP) that was extracted from liposomal Visudyne, and then free VP was separated by Sephadex G50 spin columns. fVII-tPDT using mfVII-VP conjugate, compared to ntPDT, was tested in vitro for the killing of breast cancer cells and VEGF-stimulated VEC and in vivo for inhibiting the tumour growth of breast tumours in a mouse xenograft model. We showed that: (i) fVII protein could be conjugated with VP without affecting its binding activity; (ii) fVII-tPDT could selectively kill TF-expressing breast cancer cells and VEGF-stimulated angiogenic HUVECs but had no side effects on non-TF expressing unstimulated HUVEC, CHO-K1 and 293 cells; (iii) fVII targeting enhanced the effect of VP PDT by three to four fold; (iii) fVII-tPDT induced significantly stronger levels of apoptosis and necrosis than ntPDT; and (iv) fVII-tPDT had a significantly stronger effect on inhibiting breast tumour growth in mice than ntPDT. We conclude that the fVII-targeted VP PDT that we report here is a novel and effective therapeutic with improved selectivity for the treatment of breast cancer. Since TF is expressed on many types of cancer cells including leukaemic cells and selectively on angiogenic tumour VECs, fVII-tPDT could have broad therapeutic applications for other solid cancers and leukaemia.",PMC2882923

Classically, E2 is thought to exert its effects via genomic signaling mediated by interaction with nuclear estrogen receptors. However, the role and contribution of extranuclear estrogen receptors (ER) is unclear and was the subject of the current study. To accomplish this goal, we employed two E2 conjugates (E2 dendrimer, EDC, and E2-BSA) that can interact with extranuclear ER and exert rapid nongenomic signaling, but lack the ability to interact with nuclear ER due to their inability to enter the nucleus. EDC or E2-BSA (10 microM) was injected icv 60 min prior to global cerebral ischemia (GCI). FITC-tagged EDC or E2-BSA revealed high uptake in the hippocampal CA1 region after icv injection, with a membrane (extranuclear) localization pattern in cells. Both EDC and E2-BSA exerted robust neuroprotection in the CA1 against GCI, and the effect was blocked by the ER antagonist, ICI182,780. EDC and E2-BSA both rapidly enhanced activation of the prosurvival kinases, ERK and Akt, while attenuating activation of the proapoptotic kinase, JNK following GCI, effects that were blocked by ICI182,780. Administration of an MEK or PI3K inhibitor blocked the neuroprotective effects of EDC and E2-BSA. Further studies showed that EDC increased p-CREB and BDNF in the CA1 region in an ERK- and Akt-dependent manner, and that cognitive outcome after GCI was preserved by EDC in an ER-dependent manner. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that activation of extranuclear ER results in induction of ERK-Akt-CREB-BDNF signaling in the hippocampal CA1 region, which significantly reduces ischemic neuronal injury and preserves cognitive function following GCI.

PELP1 expression is deregulated in metastatic breast tumors. We examined the mechanism and significance of ER-PELP1-mediated extranuclear signals in the cytoskeletal remodeling and metastasis. Using estrogen dendrimer conjugate (EDC) that uniquely activate ER extranuclear signaling and by using model cells that stably express PELP1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), we show that PELP1 is required for optimal activation of ER extranuclear actions. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified integrin-linked kinase 1 (ILK1) as a novel PELP1-binding protein. Activation of extranuclear signaling by EDC uniquely enhanced E2-mediated ruffles and filopodia-like structures. Using dominant-negative and dominant-active reagents, we found that estrogen-mediated extranuclear signaling promotes cytoskeleton reorganization through the ER-Src-PELP1-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-ILK1 pathway. Using in vitro Boyden chamber assays and in vivo xenograft assays, we found that ER extranuclear actions contribute to cell migration. Collectively, our results suggest that ER extranuclear actions play a role in cell motility/metastasis, establishing for the first time that endogenous PELP1 serves as a critical component of ER extranuclear actions leading to cell motility/invasion and that the ER-Src-PELP1-ILK1 pathway represents a novel therapeutic target for preventing the emergence of ER-positive metastasis.",PMC2889925

Flow cytometry results showed that Fen enhanced the escape of cells from the G(0)-G(1) checkpoint and promoted progression of both cell types into the S phase. An Annexin V assay showed that Fen had an anti-apoptotic effect on both cell types. By Real-time PCR, we found that collagen I mRNA expression increased (p < 0.05) in Fen-treated cells compared to controls, although it was greater in UtLM tumor cells. Accordingly, Fen increased (p < 0.05) collagen I protein levels in both cell lysate and supernatant when compared to controls. To further test the mechanism of Fen's effects, transactivation and competitive binding assays were done. The results showed Fen did not significantly stimulate luciferase activity at concentrations of 0.1 microM, 1.0 microM or 10.0 microM in either of the cell types. Competitive binding assays revealed that the affinity of Fen binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) was non-detectable compared to E(2). Our data show that Fen can stimulate the growth of both UtLM cells and UtSMC, which involves a combination of enhanced cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis. Also this compound can increase collagen I expression, at both mRNA and protein levels.

The present data indicate that the tested EDCs could not only affect endocrine target cells through nuclear receptors as previously shown, but could also affect these and all other cells by positively or negatively affecting PDI activity. The substrate DiE-GSSG has been demonstrated to be a convenient substrate to measure PDI reductase activity in the presence of various potential EDCs. It will certainly be usefull for the screening of potential effect of all kinds of chemicals on PDI reductase activity.",PMC2831067

Traditional receptor-mediated reporter assays in yeast were performed twelve to twenty four hours after ligand addition, used colorimetric substrates, and, in many cases, required high, non-physiological concentrations of ligand. With the advent of new chemiluminescent substrates a ligand-induced signal can be detected within thirty minutes using high picomolar to low nanomolar concentrations of estrogen. As a result of the sensitivity (EC(50) for estradiol is approximately 0.7nM) and the very short assay time (2-4h) environmental water samples can typically be assayed directly without sterilization, extraction, and concentration. Thus, these assays represent rapid and sensitive approaches for determining the presence of contaminants in environmental samples. As proof of principle, we directly assayed wastewater influent and effluent taken from a wastewater treatment plant in the El Paso, TX area for the presence of estrogenic activity. The data obtained in the four-hour yeast bioassay directly correlated with GC-mass spectrometry analysis of these same water samples.",PMC2839367

We investigated whether BPA affects human ovarian granulosa cell function. We treated KGN granulosa cells and granulosa cells from subjects undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), BPA, or BPA plus FSH in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We then evaluated expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), aromatase, and transcription factors known to mediate aromatase induction by FSH [including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), GATA4, cAMP response element binding protein-1 (CREB-1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)], as well as 17beta-estradiol (E2) secretion. KGN cells were transfected with a PPARgamma-containing vector, followed by assessment of aromatase and IGF-I expression. BPA reduced FSH-induced IGF-1 and aromatase expression and E2 secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar effects on aromatase were observed in IVF granulosa cells. SF-1 and GATA4, but not CREB-1, were reduced after BPA treatment, although PPARgamma, an inhibitor of aromatase, was significantly up-regulated by BPA in a dose-dependent manner, with simultaneous decrease of aromatase. Overexpression of PPARgamma in KGN cells reduced FSH-stimulated aromatase and IGF-1 mRNAs, with increasing concentrations of the transfected expression vector, mimicking BPA action. Also, BPA reduced granulosa cell DNA synthesis without changing DNA fragmentation, suggesting that BPA does not induce apoptosis. Overall, the data demonstrate that BPA induces PPARgamma, which mediates down-regulation of FSH-stimulated IGF-1, SF-1, GATA4, aromatase, and E2 in human granulosa cells. These observations support a potential role of altered steroidogenesis and proliferation within the ovarian follicular compartment due to this endocrine disruptor.",PMC2854770

An alternative mechanism of action of Vinclozolin involves transgenerational effects on the male reproductive tract. We previously reported in utero Vinclozolin exposure-induced prostatitis (prostate inflammation) in postpubertal rats concurrent with down-regulation of AR and increased nuclear factor-kappaB activation. We postulated the male reproductive abnormalities induced by in utero Vinclozolin exposure could be reversed by testosterone supplementation, in contrast to the permanent modifications involving DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts) described by others. To test this hypothesis, we administered high-dose testosterone at puberty to Vinclozolin-treated rats and determined the effect on anogenital distance (AGD); testicular germ cell apoptosis, concentration of elongated spermatids, and the onset of prostatitis. Concurrently we examined Dnmt1, -3A, -3B, and -3L mRNA expression. Consistent with previous reports, in utero exposure to Vinclozolin significantly reduced AGD, increased testicular germ cell apoptosis 3-fold, reduced elongated spermatid number by 40%, and induced postpubertal prostatitis in 100% of exposed males. Administration of high-dose testosterone (25 mg/kg) at puberty normalized AGD, reduced germ cell apoptosis, and restored elongated spermatid number. Testosterone restored AR and nuclear factor-kappaB expression in the prostate and abolished Vinclozolin-induced prostatitis. Altered Dnmt expression was evident with in utero Vinclozolin exposure and was not normalized after testosterone treatment. These data demonstrate in utero Vinclozolin-induced male reproductive tract abnormalities are AR mediated and reversible and involve a mechanism independent of Dnmt expression.",PMC2817613

Large numbers of environmental pollutants have been screened to identify such compounds; however, not until recently was 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (TBECH) identified as the first potent activator of the human androgen receptor (hAR). TBECH has been found in beluga whales and bird eggs and has also been found to be maternally transferred in zebrafish. In the present study we investigated interaction energies between TBECH diastereomers (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) and the hAR, and their ability to activate the receptor and induce prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression in vitro. We performed computational modeling to determine interaction energies between the ligand and the AR ligand-binding site, and measured in vitro competitive binding assays for AR by polarization fluorometry analysis. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to determine PSA activity in LNCaP and HepG2 cells. We found the gamma and delta diastereomers to be more potent activators of hAR than the alpha and beta diastereomers, which was confirmed in receptor binding studies. All TBECH diastereomers induced PSA expression in LNCaP cells even though the AR present in these cells is mutated (T877A). Modeling studies of LNCaP AR revealed that TBECH diastereomers bound to the receptor with a closer distance to the key amino acids in the ligand-binding domain, indicating stronger binding to the mutated receptor. The present study demonstrates the ability of TBECH to activate the hAR, indicating that it is a potential endocrine disruptor.",PMC2799458

The adrenal is a target of endocrine disruption that could influence tumor formation at other sites. Thus, we examined possible fetal arsenic-induced adrenal effects as a potential basis of arsenic enhancement of DES carcinogenesis. Pregnant CD1 mice were given drinking water containing 85 ppm arsenic as sodium arsenite or unaltered water from day 8 to day 18 of gestation and were allowed to deliver normally. Groups of offspring were subsequently injected s.c. on postpartum days 1-5 with DES (2 microg/pup/day) and killed on postnatal day 12. Total RNA was isolated from the whole adrenal glands, and the expression of various genes was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Fetal arsenic exposure greatly enhanced DES-induced, estrogen-linked gene expression, such as estrogen receptor-alpha and trefoil factors. Expression of genes involved with steroid metabolism and/or methionine metabolism was also increased, including genes encoding for 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5 (HSD17beta5) and androstenedione 15alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp2a4). The transcripts for homocysteine cycling genes (betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase and thioether S-methyltransferase) and developmental marker genes (alpha-fetoprotein, insulin-like growth factor 2 and IGF binding protein-1), were also higher with arsenic plus DES than either treatment alone. Thus, exposure of the mouse to arsenic during a critical period of fetal development may potentially alter adrenal genetic programming, leading to endocrine disruption and potentially enhancing tumor formation together with DES at other sites much later in life. Functional studies, such as changes in circulating steroids, would greatly support this hypothesis, and are planned.",PMC7291701

Offspring were tested for ethanol preference during adolescence (postnatal day (PND) 30-43) and again at adulthood (PND 60-73), followed by assays for oxytocin mRNA expression and receptor binding in relevant brain regions. Prenatal exposure decreased ethanol preference in males during adolescence, and decreased consumption and preference in females during adulthood compared to controls. Oxytocin receptor binding in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus was increased in adult prenatally exposed males only.

It has been reported that BPA increases the cell proliferation activity of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells as well as 17-beta estradiol (E2) and diethylstilbestrol (DES). However, BPA induces target genes through ER-dependent and ER-independent manners which are different from the actions induced by E2. Therefore, BPA may be unique in estrogen-dependent cell proliferation compared to other endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In the present study, to test whether ERalpha is essential to the BPA-induced proliferation on MCF-7 cells, we suppressed the ERalpha expression of MCF-7 cells by RNA interference (RNAi). Proliferation effects in the presence of E2, DES and BPA were not observed in ERalpha-knockdown MCF-7 cells in comparison with control MCF-7. In addition, a marker of proliferative potential, MIB-1 labeling index (LI), showed no change in BPA-treated groups compared with vehicle-treated groups on ERalpha-knockdown MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ERalpha has a role in BPA-induced cell proliferation as well as E2 and DES. Moreover, this study indicated that the direct knockdown of ERalpha using RNAi serves as an additional tool to evaluate, in parallel with MCF-7 cell proliferation assay, for potential EDCs.",PMC2685020

Here, we show that tributyltin (TBT) activates all three RXR-PPAR-alpha, -gamma, -delta heterodimers, primarily through its interaction with RXR. In addition, the 1.9 A resolution structure of the RXR-alpha ligand-binding domain in complex with TBT shows a covalent bond between the tin atom and residue Cys 432 of helix H11. This interaction largely accounts for the high binding affinity of TBT, which only partly occupies the RXR-alpha ligand-binding pocket. Our data allow an understanding of the binding and activation properties of the various organotins and suggest a mechanism by which these tin compounds could affect other nuclear receptor signalling pathways.",PMC2672886

This epidemic may be affected by exposure to xenobiotic chemicals. Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, is detectable at nanomolar levels in human serum worldwide. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific hormone that increases insulin sensitivity and reduces tissue inflammation. Thus, any factor that suppresses adiponectin release could lead to insulin resistance and increased susceptibility to obesity-associated diseases. In this study we aimed to compare a) the effects of low doses of BPA and estradiol (E(2)) on adiponectin secretion from human breast, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose explants and mature adipocytes, and b) expression of putative estrogen and estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) in these tissues. We determined adiponectin levels in conditioned media from adipose explants or adipocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. We determined expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha and beta, G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), and ERRs alpha, beta, and gamma by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. BPA at 0.1 and 1 nM doses suppressed adiponectin release from all adipose depots examined. Despite substantial variability among patients, BPA was as effective, and often more effective, than equimolar concentrations of E(2). Adipose tissue expresses similar mRNA levels of ERalpha, ERbeta, and ERRgamma, and 20- to 30-fold lower levels of GPR30, ERRalpha, and ERRbeta. BPA at environmentally relevant doses inhibits the release of a key adipokine that protects humans from metabolic syndrome.

They are also the major mediators of endocrine disruption by xenobiotic pollutants that mimic or block estrogen action. ERs that are sensitive to estrogen and endocrine disrupters have long been thought to be restricted to vertebrates: although there is evidence for estrogen signaling in invertebrates, the only ERs studied to date, from mollusks and cephalochordates, have been insensitive to estrogen and therefore incapable of mediating estrogen signaling or disruption. To determine whether estrogen sensitivity is ancestral or a unique characteristic of vertebrate ERs, we isolated and characterized ERs from two annelids, Platynereis dumerilii and Capitella capitata, because annelids are the sister phylum to mollusks and have been shown to produce and respond to estrogens. Functional assays show that annelid ERs specifically activate transcription in response to low estrogen concentrations and bind estrogen with high affinity. Furthermore, numerous known endocrine-disrupting chemicals activate or antagonize the annelid ER. This is the first report of a hormone-activated invertebrate ER. Our results indicate that estrogen signaling via the ER is as ancient as the ancestral bilaterian animal and corroborate the estrogen sensitivity of the ancestral steroid receptor. They suggest that the taxonomic scope of endocrine disruption by xenoestrogens may be very broad and reveal how functional diversity evolved in a gene family central to animal endocrinology.",PMC2659264

Dibutyltin (DBT) is used as stabilizer in the production of polyvinyl chloride plastics, and it is also the major metabolite formed from tributyltin (TBT) in vivo. DBT is immunotoxic, however, the responsible targets remain to be defined. Due to the importance of glucocorticoids in immune-modulation, we investigated whether DBT could interfere with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function. We used HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with human GR as well as rat H4IIE hepatoma cells and native human macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages expressing endogenous receptor to study organotin effects on GR function. Docking of organotins was used to investigate the binding mechanism. We found that nanomolar concentrations of DBT, but not other organotins tested, inhibit ligand binding to GR and its transcriptional activity. Docking analysis indicated that DBT inhibits GR activation allosterically by inserting into a site close to the steroid-binding pocket, which disrupts a key interaction between the A-ring of the glucocorticoid and the GR. DBT inhibited glucocorticoid-induced expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and tyrosine-aminotransferase (TAT) and abolished the glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression of TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity. Moreover, DBT abrogated the glucocorticoid-mediated suppression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF-alpha production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated native human macrophages and human THP-1 macrophages.

We have investigated the impact of estrogen-mediated extranuclear-initiated pathways on global gene expression by using estrogen-dendrimer conjugates (EDCs), which because of their charge and size remain outside the nucleus and can only initiate extranuclear signaling. Genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells identified a subset of 17beta-estradiol (E2)-regulated genes ( approximately 25%) as EDC responsive. The EDC and E2-elicited increases in gene expression were due to increases in gene transcription, as observed in nuclear run-on assays and RNA polymerase II recruitment and phosphorylation. Treatment with antiestrogen or ERalpha knockdown using small interfering RNA abolished EDC-mediated gene stimulation, whereas GPR30 knockdown or treatment with a GPR30-selective ligand was without effect, indicating ER as the mediator of these gene regulations. Inhibitors of MAPK kinase and c-Src suppressed both E2 and EDC stimulated gene expression. Of note, in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, EDC was unable to recruit ERalpha to estrogen-responsive regions of regulated genes, whereas ERalpha recruitment by E2 was very effective. These findings suggest that other transcription factors or kinases that are downstream effectors of EDC-initiated extranuclear signaling cascades are recruited to regulatory regions of EDC-responsive genes in order to elicit gene stimulation.

In the mouse 3-day assay, DE-71 administered alone had no effect on uterine weight, uterine epithelial height (UEH), or vaginal epithelial thickness (VET); however, when DE-71 was administered as a cotreatment, it potentiated estradiol's effect on uterine weight. DE-71 administered sc to BALB/c mice for 34 days slightly increased UEH and VET, and attenuated the estradiol-induced increase in UEH; these effects were not seen in BALB/c mice treated po or in C57BL/6 mice treated sc.

The goal of this study was to determine whether As can also disrupt gene regulation via the retinoic acid (RA) receptor (RAR) and/or the thyroid hormone (TH) receptor (TR) and whether these effects are similar to previously observed effects on steroid regulation. Human embryonic NT2 or rat pituitary GH3 cells were treated with 0.01-5 microM sodium arsenite for 24 hr, with or without RA or TH, respectively, to examine effects of As on receptor-mediated gene transcription. At low, noncytotoxic doses, As significantly altered RAR-dependent gene transcription of a transfected RAR response element-luciferase construct and the native RA-inducible cytochrome P450 CYP26A gene in NT2 cells. Likewise, low-dose As significantly altered expression of a transfected TR response element-luciferase construct and the endogenous TR-regulated type I deiodinase (DIO1) gene in a similar manner in GH3 cells. An amphibian ex vivo tail metamorphosis assay was used to examine whether endocrine disruption by low-dose As could have specific pathophysiologic consequences, because tail metamorphosis is tightly controlled by TH through TR.

As had similar effects on RAR- and TR-mediated gene regulation as those previously observed for the steroid receptors, suggesting a common mechanism or action. Arsenic also profoundly affected a TR-dependent developmental process in a model animal system at very low concentrations.

The Cd-induced signal activation patterns in the three cell lines mimicked those exhibited in response to 17 beta-estradiol. Specifically, treatment of MCF-7 cells, that express ER alpha, ER beta and GPR30, to 0.5-10 microM Cd for only 2.5 min resulted in transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Cd also triggered a gradual increase and sustained activation of AKT during the 60 min treatment period. In SK-BR-3 cells, that express only GPR30, Cd also caused a transient activation of ERK1/2, but not of AKT. In contrast, in MDA-MB-231 cells, that express only ER beta, Cd was unable to cause rapid activation of either ERK1/2 or AKT. A transient phosphorylation of ER alpha was also observed within 2.5 min of Cd exposure in the MCF-7 cells. While the estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, did not prevent the effect of Cd on these signals, specific siRNA against hER alpha significantly reduced Cd-induced activation of ERK1/2 and completely blocked the activation of AKT.

We used several in vitro and ex vivo assays in an attempt to identify suitable biomarkers for antithyroid action testing a selected panel of putative EDCs. In vitro we detected stimulation or inhibition of iodide uptake into FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, inhibition of thyroid hormone binding to transthyretin, agonistic or antagonistic effects in a thyroid hormone receptor-dependent reporter assay, and inhibition of thyroid peroxidase using a novel assay system based on human recombinant thyroperoxidase that might be suitable for routine screening for potential EDCs. In rats, chronic application of several EDCs led to changes in thyroid morphology, alterations of thyrotropin and thyroid hormone serum levels as well as alterations in peripheral thyroid hormone-regulated end points such as malic enzyme and type I 5'-deiodinase activity. As the effects of EDCs do not reflect classic mechanisms of hormone-dependent regulation and feedback, we believe multitarget and multimodal actions of EDCs affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.

All four compounds inhibited aromatase activity and were agonists and antagonists of ER and AR, respectively. nNP increased AhR activity concentration-dependently and further increased the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin AhR action. nOP caused dual responses with a weak increased and a decreased AhR activity at lower (10(-8) M) and higher concentrations (10(-5)-10(-4) M), respectively. AhR activity was inhibited with BPA (10(-5)-10(-4) M) and weakly increased with BPA-DM (10(-5) M), respectively. nNP showed the highest relative potency (REP) compared with the respective controls in the ER, AhR, and aromatase assays, whereas similar REP was observed for the four chemicals in the AR assay. Our in vitro data clearly indicate that the four industrial compounds have ED potentials and that the effects can be mediated via several cellular pathways, including the two sex steroid hormone receptors (ER and AR), aromatase activity converting testosterone to estrogen, and AhR; AhR is involved in syntheses of steroids and metabolism of steroids and xenobiotic compounds.",PMC2174402

MXC is a less-environmentally persistent analog of DDT that behaves as a weak estrogen. Using transient transfection assays in HepG2 cells, we have previously shown that each receptor is responsive to the endogenous ligand 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) in a dose-dependent manner. The parent compound, MXC, showed dose-dependent stimulation of transcriptional activation through all three ERs. In addition to the parent molecule, each of the metabolites was also estrogenic with all three ERs. The order of potency for ERalpha and ERbetab was HPTE>OH-MXC>MXC, while the opposite order was seen for ERbetaa. HepG2 cells did not substantially metabolize MXC to the active metabolites, thus the activity of MXC was not due to metabolism. When examining the effects of increasing concentrations of MXC at a fixed concentration of E(2), all three ERs show increased activity compared to that with E(2) alone, showing that the effects of MXC and E(2) are additive. However, when this experiment was repeated with increasing concentrations of HPTE at a fixed concentration of E(2), the activity of ERalpha was decreased, that of ERbetab was increased, while that of ERbetaa was unaffected compared to E(2) alone. These experiments suggest that HPTE functions as an E(2) antagonist with ERalpha, an E(2) agonist with ERbetab and does not perturb E(2) stimulation of ERbetaa. While it is clear the ERbeta subtypes are the products of different genes (due to a gene duplication in teleosts) the differences in their responses to MXC and its metabolites indicate that their functions diverge, both in their in vivo molecular response to E(2), as well as in their interaction with endocrine disrupting compounds found in the wild.",PMC2268757

The mechanism involves the inhibition of phosphodiesterase and subsequent elevation of cAMP. We compared steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) expression in atrazine responsive and non-responsive cell lines and transfected SF-1 into nonresponsive cell lines to assess SF-1's role in atrazine-induced aromatase. We used a luciferase reporter driven by the SF-1-dependent aromatase promoter (ArPII) to examine activation of this promoter by atrazine and the related simazine. We mutated the SF-1 binding site to confirm the role of SF-1. We also examined effects of 55 other chemicals. Finally, we examined the ability of atrazine and simazine to bind to SF-1 and enhance SF-1 binding to ArPII. Atrazine-responsive adrenal carcinoma cells (H295R) expressed 54 times more SF-1 than nonresponsive ovarian granulosa KGN cells. Exogenous SF-1 conveyed atrazine-responsiveness to otherwise nonresponsive KGN and NIH/3T3 cells. Atrazine induced binding of SF-1 to chromatin and mutation of the SF-1 binding site in ArPII eliminated SF-1 binding and atrazine-responsiveness in H295R cells. Out of 55 chemicals examined, only atrazine, simazine, and benzopyrene induced luciferase via ArPII. Atrazine bound directly to SF-1, showing that atrazine is a ligand for this ""orphan"" receptor. The current findings are consistent with atrazine's endocrine-disrupting effects in fish, amphibians, and reptiles; the induction of mammary and prostate cancer in laboratory rodents; and correlations between atrazine and similar reproductive cancers in humans. This study highlights the importance of atrazine as a risk factor in endocrine disruption in wildlife and reproductive cancers in laboratory rodents and humans.",PMC1867956

This system represents an important environmental interest, because a wide variety of molecules, known as endocrine disruptors, can bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) and induce adverse health effects in wildlife and humans. Using proper experimental conditions, the nanoESI-MS approach allowed for the detection of specific ligand interactions with hERalpha LBD. The relative gas-phase stability of selected hERalpha LBD-ligand complexes did not mirror the binding affinity in solution, a result that demonstrates the prominent role of hydrophobic contacts for stabilizing ER-ligand complexes in solution. The best approach to evaluate relative solution-binding affinity by nanoESI-MS was to perform competitive binding experiments with 17beta-estradiol (E2) used as a reference ligand. Among the ligands tested, the relative binding affinity for hERalpha LBD measured by nanoESI-MS was 4-hydroxtamoxifen approximately diethylstilbestrol > E2 >> genistein >> bisphenol A, consistent with the order of the binding affinities in solution. The limited reproducibility of the bound to free protein ratio measured by nanoESI-MS for this system only allowed the binding constants (K(d)) to be estimated (low nanomolar range for E2). The specificity of nanoESI-MS combined with its speed (1 min/ligand), low sample consumption (90 pmol protein/ligand), and its sensitivity for ligand (30 ng/mL) demonstrates that this technique is a promising method for screening suspected endocrine disrupting compounds and to qualitatively evaluate their binding affinity.",PMC2206638

Numerous natural and synthetic chemical compounds, commonly known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), have been shown to alter the physiological effects of estrogen in humans and wildlife. As such, these EDCs may cause unanticipated and even undesirable effects. Large-scale in vitro and in vivo screening of chemicals to assess their estrogenic activity would demand a prodigious investment of time, labor, and money and would require animal testing on an unprecedented scale. Approaches in silico are increasingly recognized as playing a vital role in screening and prioritizing chemicals to extend limited resources available for experimental testing. Here, we evaluated a multistep procedure that is suitable for in silico (virtual) screening of large chemical databases to identify compounds exhibiting estrogenic activity. This procedure incorporates Shape Signatures, a novel computational tool that rapidly compares molecules on the basis of similarity in shape, polarity, and other bio-relevant properties. Using 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OH TAM) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) as input queries, we employed this scheme to search a sample database of approximately 200,000 commercially available organic chemicals for matches (hits). Of the eight compounds identified computationally as potentially (anti)estrogenic, biological evaluation confirmed two as heretofore unknown estrogen antagonists. Subsequent radioligand binding assays confirmed that two of these three compounds exhibit antiestrogenic activities comparable to 4-OH TAM. Molecular modeling studies of these ligands docked inside the binding pocket of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) elucidated key ligand-receptor interactions that corroborate these experimental findings.

A microarray technology is a very valuable method for the prediction of hormone-responsive activities in various gene expressions. Thus, we investigated the altered gene expression by estrogen and endocrine disruptors (EDs) using microarray technology in the uterus of immature rats. In this study, the expression levels of only 555 genes (7.42%) among the 7636 genes spotted on microarray chips were enhanced by more than two-fold following treatment with estradiol (E2), suggesting that direct or rapid response to E2 is widespread at the mRNA levels in these genes. In addition, elevated expression levels of the genes (over 2-fold) were observed by diethylstilbestrol (DES; 9.01%), octyl-phenol (OP; 8.81%), nonyl-phenol (NP; 9.51%), bisphenol-A (BPA; 8.26%) or genistein (9.97%) in the uterus of immature rats.

In addition, the mRNA levels of these genes by real-time PCR were increased at follicular phase when E2 level was elevated during estrous cycle of adult female rats.

In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which dieldrin and p,p'-DDE cause endocrine disruption in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), fish were exposed subchronically through the diet to both contaminants. Following 120 days of exposure, p,p'-DDE decreased estradiol in females, but increased 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Dieldrin on the other hand, decreased estradiol and 11-ketotestosterone in both sexes. Both pesticides also altered steady state mRNA expression levels of a set of genes chosen to represent three possible mechanisms of endocrine disruption: (1) direct interaction with soluble sex steroid receptors, (2) biosynthesis of endogenous sex hormones, and (3) metabolism of endogenous hormones. p,p'-DDE acted as a weak estrogen, increasing the expression of vitellogenin and estrogen receptor alpha in the liver. p,p'-DDE also altered the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of endogenous hormones as well as their metabolism. Dieldrin, on the other hand, only altered expression of vitellogenin and not estrogen receptor alpha.

Marine organisms were collected in two different areas of the Mediterranean Sea. The estrogenic activity of tissues was assessed using an in vitro yeast reporter gene assay (S. cerevisiae RMY 326 ER-ERE). Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180) in fish tissue was also evaluated. Thirty-eight percent of extracts showed a hormone-like activity higher than 10% of the activity elicited by 10 nM 17b-estradiol (E2) used as control. Total PCB concentrations ranged from 0.002 up to 1.785 ng/g wet weight. Chemical analyses detected different levels of contamination among the species collected in the two areas, with the ones collected in the Adriatic Sea showing concentrations significantly higher than those collected in the Tyrrhenian Sea (p < 0.01).

They have been recognized to have detrimental health effects both on wildlife and humans acting as endocrine disrupters due to their ability of mimicking the action of the steroid hormones, and thus interfering with hormone response. There are several experimental evidences that they bind and activate human steroid receptors. However, despite the growing concern about the toxicological activity of endocrine disrupters, molecular data of the interaction of these compounds with biological targets are still lacking. We have used a flexible docking approach to characterize the molecular interaction of seven endocrine disrupting chemicals with estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors in the ligand-binding domain. All ligands docked in the buried hydrophobic cavity corresponding to the hormone steroid pocket. The interaction was characterized by multiple hydrophobic contacts involving a different number of residues facing the binding pocket, depending on ligands orientation. The EDC ligands did not display a unique binding mode, probably due to their lipophilicity and flexibility, which conferred them a great adaptability into the hydrophobic and large binding pocket of steroid receptors. Our results are in agreement with toxicological data on binding and allow to describe a pattern of interactions for a group of ECD to steroid receptors suggesting the requirement of a hydrophobic cavity to accommodate these chlorine carrying compounds. Although the affinity is lower than for hormones, their action can be brought about by a possible synergistic effect.",PMC1866398

However, data on disruption of thyroid signaling are fragmentary, particularly at the molecular level. Thyroid hormone (TH; triiodothyronine, T3) acts principally by modulating transcription from target genes; thus, thyroid signaling is particularly amenable to analysis with a transcriptional assay. Also, T3 orchestrates amphibian metamorphosis, thereby providing an exceptional model for identifying thyroid-disrupting chemicals. We combined these two advantages to develop a method for following and quantifying the transcriptional action of T3 in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. This technology provides a means of assessing thyroid activity at the molecular level in a physiologically relevant situation. Moreover, translucent tadpoles are amenable to ""on-line"" imaging with fluorescent reporter constructs that facilitate in vivo measurement of transcriptional activity. We adapted transgenesis with TH-responsive elements coupled to either luciferase or green fluorescent protein to follow T3-dependent transcription in vivo. To reduce time of exposure and to synchronize responses, we optimized a physiologic pretreatment protocol that induced competence to respond to T3 and thus to assess T3 effects and T3 disruption within 48 hr. This pretreatment protocol was based on a short (24 hr), weak (10(-12) M) pulse of T3 that induced TH receptors, facilitating and synchronizing the transcriptional responses. This protocol was successfully applied to somatic and germinal transgenesis with both reporter systems. Finally, we show that the transcriptional assay allows detection of the thyroid-disrupting activity of environmentally relevant concentrations (10(-8) M) of acetochlor, a persistent herbicide.",PMC1310923

DHEAS-induced beta-HEX release was also abolished by G(q/11)-AS, but not by G(q/11)-MS. Pharmacological analyses revealed that the neurosteroids stimulated a putative membrane receptor through activation of the novel G(q/11) and phospholipase C. 3 While representative endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) did not show any degranulation or nocifensive actions by themselves, they blocked the DHEAS-induced degranulation. 4 The binding of a PROG-BSA-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (PROG-BSA-FITC) to cells was inhibited by neurosteroids and EDCs. 5 In the algogenic-induced biting and licking responses test, DHEAS caused agonistic nocifensive actions in a dose-dependent manner between 1 and 10 fmol (i.pl.). DHEAS-induced nocifensive actions were abolished by PROG-BSA or nonylphenol. 6 Taken together, these results suggest that a G(q/11)-coupled neurosteroid receptor may regulate the neuroimmunological activity related to sensory stimulation and that some EDCs have antagonistic actions for this receptor.",PMC1576165

Phytoestrogens, including genistein, daidzein, and coumestrol, are fairly abundant in soybeans and alfalfa, common ingredients of laboratory animal diets. These compounds are weak agonists for the estrogen receptor (ER) and, when administered at sufficient doses, elicit an estrogenic response in vivo. In this study, we assessed the potential estrogenic effects of dietary phytoestrogens at the gene expression level, together with traditional biologic end points, using estrogen-responsive tissues of the immature female rat. We compared the gene expression profile of the uterus and ovaries, as a pool, obtained using a uterotrophic assay protocol, from intact prepubertal rats fed a casein-based diet (free from soy and alfalfa) or a regular rodent diet (Purina 5001) containing soy and alfalfa. Estrogenic potency of the phytoestrogen-containing diet was determined by analyzing uterine wet weight gain, luminal epithelial cell height, and gene expression profile in the uterus and ovaries. These were compared with the same parameters evaluated in animals exposed to a low dose of a potent ER agonist [0.1 microg/kg/day 17alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE) for 4 days]. Exposure to dietary phytoestrogens or to a low dose of EE did not advance vaginal opening, increase uterine wet weight, or increase luminal epithelial cell height in animals fed either diet. Although there are genes whose expression differs in animals fed the soy/alfalfa-based diet versus the casein diet, those genes are not associated with estrogenic stimulation. The expression of genes well known to be estrogen regulated, such as progesterone receptor, intestinal calcium-binding protein, and complement component 3, is not affected by consumption of the soy/alfalfa-based diet when assessed by microarray or quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis.
