Bisphenol A (BPA), recognized as one of the most prevalent and widely distributed endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), has been consistently linked to the progression of CVD. This research centers on unraveling the molecular mechanisms responsible for the toxic effects of BPA exposure on CVD. Key targets and pathways involved in action of BPA on CVD were investigated by network toxicology. Binding abilities of BPA to core targets were evaluated by molecular docking. Based on information retrieved from ChEMBL, DrugBank, and OMIM databases, a total of 27 potential targets were found to be associated with the influence of BPA on CVD. Furthermore, the STRING and Cytoscape software were employed to identify three central genes-ESR1, PPARG, and PTGS2-and to construct both the protein-protein interaction network and an interaction diagram of potential targets. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses via WebGestalt revealed key biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), molecular functions (MF), and pathways, such as the calcium signaling pathway, inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, gap junction, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, and cAMP signaling pathway, predominantly involved in BPA-induced CVD toxicity. By using molecular docking investigations, it proved that BPA binds to ESR1, PPARG, and PTGS2 steadily and strongly. This study not only establishes a theoretical framework for understanding the molecular toxicity mechanism of BPA in cardiovascular disease (CVD) but also introduces an innovative network toxicology approach to methodically investigate the influence of environmental contaminants on CVD. This methodology sets the stage for drug discovery efforts targeting CVD linked to exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs).",PMC11133888

Generally, these pollutants enter the coastal environment through the discharge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and finally threaten the organisms in the receiving waterbody. The study investigated the environmental behavior of MPs and EDCs in two typical WWTPs in one of the megacities in China, Shanghai. The abundance of MPs in the influent ranged from 321 to 976 items/L. Four shapes (films, fragments, fibers, and microbead) were found, while fibers and films dominated. Transparent (31-63%) and white (20-47%) MPs were more frequently observed, while polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose, and cellophane were the main polymetric materials. The size of the MPs fell between 15.8 μm and 2220 μm, and the smaller one (<500 μm) dominated. The removal efficiencies of the two WWTPs for MPs ranged from 64% to 92%, and both WWTPs performed better for large pieces of MPs (>500 μm). For EDCs, total concentrations in the influent were detected, ranging from 113 to 2780 ng/L. Two groups, including phenolic estrogens (PEs) and steroid estrogens (SEs), were detected, and PEs, especially bisphenol A (BPA), were the predominant individuals among the studied EDCs. Specifically, PEs ranged from 82.8 to 2637 ng/L, while SEs ranged from 27.3 to 143 ng/L. The removal efficiencies of the WWTPs for EDCs varied (82.8-100%) as well, possibly due to the different treatment compartments and contamination load in the influent. Seasonal variations for both MPs and EDCs were observed. Specifically, concentrations of MPs and EDCs in WWTPs influent were higher in the wet season, as well as the removal efficiency. Furthermore, there was a correlation observed between the concentrations of MPs and EDCs, suggesting that MPs and EDCs may originate from the same source and that EDCs released by MPs cannot be ignored during treatment. Finally, the study evaluated the environmental risk of the effluents. MPs led to a minor risk (Level I), while EDCs might lead to an adverse impact on algae (RQs = 0.0014-0.024) and fish (RQs = 3.4-30.2). In summary, WWTPs received considerable amounts of MPs and EDCs. Although the WWTPs removed the contaminants efficiently, the environmental risk of the effluent needs to be noted.",PMC11126012

To investigate associations of prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures with MetS risk score in children and identify associated proteins and metabolites. This population-based, birth cohort study used data collected between April 1, 2003, and February 26, 2016, from the Human Early Life Exposome cohort based in France, Greece, Lithuania, Norway, Spain, and the UK. Eligible participants included mother-child pairs with measured prenatal EDC exposures and complete data on childhood MetS risk factors, proteins, and metabolites. Data were analyzed between October 2022 and July 2023. Nine metals, 3 organochlorine pesticides, 5 polychlorinated biphenyls, 2 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 5 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), 10 phthalate metabolites, 3 phenols, 4 parabens, and 4 organophosphate pesticide metabolites measured in urine and blood samples collected during pregnancy. At 6 to 11 years of age, a composite MetS risk score was constructed using z scores of waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin levels. Childhood levels of 44 urinary metabolites, 177 serum metabolites, and 35 plasma proteins were quantified using targeted methods. Associations were assessed using bayesian weighted quantile sum regressions applied to mixtures for each chemical group. The study included 1134 mothers (mean [SD] age at birth, 30.7 [4.9] years) and their children (mean [SD] age, 7.8 [1.5] years; 617 male children [54.4%] and 517 female children [45.6%]; mean [SD] MetS risk score, -0.1 [2.3]). MetS score increased per 1-quartile increase of the mixture for metals (β = 0.44; 95% credible interval [CrI], 0.30 to 0.59), organochlorine pesticides (β = 0.22; 95% CrI, 0.15 to 0.29), PBDEs (β = 0.17; 95% CrI, 0.06 to 0.27), and PFAS (β = 0.19; 95% CrI, 0.14 to 0.24). High-molecular weight phthalate mixtures (β = -0.07; 95% CrI, -0.10 to -0.04) and low-molecular weight phthalate mixtures (β = -0.13; 95% CrI, -0.18 to -0.08) were associated with a decreased MetS score. Most EDC mixtures were associated with elevated proinflammatory proteins, amino acids, and altered glycerophospholipids, which in turn were associated with increased MetS score. This cohort study suggests that prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures may be associated with adverse metabolic health in children. Given the pervasive nature of EDCs and the increase in MetS, these findings hold substantial public health implications.",PMC11117089

Vitamin D has often been reported to play a role in sleep health and may be affected by endocrine-disrupting compounds. The study utilized data from 5476 individuals in the NHANES project to investigate the correlation between combined exposure to environmental EDCs and sleep duration through modeling various exposures. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of vitamin D in the present scenario. Preliminary analyses suggested that vitamin D-deficient individuals generally slept shorter than individuals with normal vitamin D (p < 0.05). Exposure to Mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), triclosan (TRS), and Mono-benzyl phthalate (MZP), either alone or in combination, was associated with reduced sleep duration and a greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Individuals with low vitamin D levels exposed to TRS experienced shorter sleep duration than those with normal vitamin D levels (p < 0.05). TRS and MZP were identified as crucial factors in patient outcomes when evaluating mixed exposures (p < 0.05). The results provide new data supporting a link between exposure to EDCs and insufficient sleep length. Additionally, they imply that a vitamin D shortage may worsen the sleep problems induced by EDCs.",PMC11085561

Few studies have been reported on the relationship between human exposure to phthalates and the level of circulating microRNAs (miRs), especially those miRs encapsulated in extracellular vesicles/exosomes or exosome-like vesicles (ELVs). We examined the relationship of ELV-miR expression patterns and urine of adult men with five phthalate metabolites (i.e., mono isobutyl phthalate, mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono benzyl phthalate, mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) to identify potential biomarkers and relevant pathways. We found significant positive associations which were further confirmed by multivariable analysis. Overall, our analyses showed that the Σ phthalate metabolite concentration was associated with a significant increase in the expression level of two miRs found in ELV: miR-202 and miR-543. Different pathways including cancer and immune-related responses were predicted to be involved in this relationship. Analyzing the specific downstream target genes of miR-202 and miR-543, we identified the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as the key gene in several converging pathways. In summary, the obtained results demonstrate that exposure to environmental phthalates could be related to altered expression profiles of specific ELV-miRs in adult men, thereby demonstrating the potential of miRs carried by exosomes to act as early effect biomarkers.",PMC11084695

Until now literature in this scope suffers from methodologic limitations in exposure assessment using one or few urine samples and missing assessment during the infancy period. We investigated the associations between early-life exposure to quickly metabolized chemicals and post-natal growth, relying on repeated within-subject urine collections over pregnancy and infancy. We studied the associations of four phenols, four parabens, seven phthalates, and one nonphthalate plasticizer from weekly pooled urine samples collected from the mother during second and third trimesters (median 18 and 34 gestational weeks, respectively) and infant at 2 and 12 months of age, and child growth until 36 months. We relied on repeated measures of height, weight and head circumference from study visits and the child health booklet to predict growth outcomes at 3 and 36 months using the Jenss-Bayley nonlinear mixed model. We assessed associations with individual chemicals using adjusted linear regression and mixtures of chemicals using a Bayesian kernel machine regression model. The unipollutant analysis revealed few associations. Bisphenol S (BPS) at second trimester was positively associated with all infant growth parameters at 3 and 36 months, with similar patterns between exposure at third trimester and all infant growth parameters at 3 months. Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) at 12 months was positively associated with body mass index (BMI), weight, and head circumference at 36 months. Mixture analysis revealed positive associations between exposure at 12 months and BMI and weight at 36 months, with MnBP showing the highest effect size within the mixture. This study suggests that exposure in early infancy may be associated with increased weight and BMI in early childhood, which are risk factors of obesity in later life. Furthermore, this study highlighted the impact of BPS, a compound replacing bisphenol A, which has never been studied in this context. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13644.",PMC11086749

Growing evidence suggests environmental exposures, including endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications that are associated with long-term cardiometabolic risk. However, the impact of perinatal EDC exposure on subsequent cardiometabolic risk post-pregnancy is less understood. The Environmental Reproductive and Glucose Outcomes (ERGO) Study was established to investigate the associations of environmental exposures during the perinatal period with post-pregnancy parental cardiometabolic health. Pregnant individuals aged ≥18 years without pre-existing diabetes were recruited at <15 weeks of gestation from Boston, Massachusetts area hospitals. Participants completed ≤4 prenatal study visits (median: 12, 19, 26, 36 weeks of gestation) and 1 postpartum visit (median: 9 weeks), during which we collected biospecimens, health histories, demographic and behavioural data, and vitals and anthropometric measurements. Participants completed a postpartum fasting 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Clinical data were abstracted from electronic medical records. Ongoing (as of 2024) extended post-pregnancy follow-up visits occur annually following similar data collection protocols. We enrolled 653 unique pregnancies and retained 633 through delivery. Participants had a mean age of 33 years, 10% (n=61) developed gestational diabetes and 8% (n=50) developed pre-eclampsia. Participant pregnancy and postpartum urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and postpartum glycaemic biomarkers were quantified. To date, studies within ERGO found higher exposure to phthalates and phthalate mixtures, and separately, higher exposure to radioactive ambient particulate matter, were associated with adverse gestational glycaemic outcomes. Additionally, certain personal care products used in pregnancy, notably hair oils, were associated with higher urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations, earlier gestational age at delivery and lower birth weight. Future work will leverage the longitudinal data collected on pregnancy and cardiometabolic outcomes, environmental exposures, questionnaires, banked biospecimens and paediatric data within the ERGO Study.",PMC11086466
38704805,"Christopher J Borgert, Lyle D Burgoon, John C Matthews",The physiological and biochemical basis of potency thresholds modeled using human estrogen receptor alpha: implications for identifying endocrine disruptors.,2024,"The endocrine system functions by interactions between ligands and receptors. Ligands exhibit potency for binding to and interacting with receptors. Potency is the product of affinity and efficacy. Potency and physiological concentration determine the ability of a ligand to produce physiological effects. The kinetic behavior of ligand-receptor interactions conforms to the laws of mass action. The laws of mass action define the relationship between the affinity of a ligand and the fraction of cognate receptors that it occupies at any physiological concentration. We previously identified the minimum ligand potency required to produce clinically observable estrogenic agonist effects via the human estrogen receptor-alpha (ERα). By examining data on botanical estrogens and dietary supplements, we demonstrated that ERα ligands with potency lower than one one-thousandth that of the primary endogenous hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) do not produce clinically observable estrogenic effects. This allowed us to propose a Human-Relevant Potency Threshold (HRPT) for ERα ligands of 1 × 10-4 relative to E2. Here, we test the hypothesis that the HRPT for ERα arises from the receptor occupancy by the normal metabolic milieu of endogenous ERα ligands. The metabolic milieu comprises precursors to hormones, metabolites of hormones, and other normal products of metabolism. We have calculated fractional receptor occupancies for ERα ligands with potencies below and above the previously established HRPT when normal circulating levels of some endogenous ERα ligands and E2 were also present. Fractional receptor occupancy calculations showed that individual ERα ligands with potencies more than tenfold higher than the HRPT can compete for occupancy at ERα against individual components of the endogenous metabolic milieu and against mixtures of those components at concentrations found naturally in human blood. Ligands with potencies less than tenfold higher than the HRPT were unable to compete successfully for ERα. These results show that the HRPT for ERα agonism (10-4 relative to E2) proposed previously is quite conservative and should be considered strong evidence against the potential for disruption of the estrogenic pathway. For chemicals with potency 10-3 of E2, the potential for estrogenic endocrine disruption must be considered equivocal and subject to the presence of corroborative evidence. Most importantly, this work demonstrates that the endogenous metabolic milieu is responsible for the observed ERα agonist HRPT, that this HRPT applies also to ERα antagonists, and it provides a compelling mechanistic explanation for the HRPT that is grounded in basic principles of molecular kinetics using well characterized properties and concentrations of endogenous components of normal metabolism.",PMC11106131

Boiling is a common household method used to produce relatively high-quality drinking water in some countries and regions. In this study, with the aid of an integrated approach of in vitro bioassays and non-target analysis based on high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography, alterations in endocrine-disrupting activities in tap water samples without and with boiling were revealed, as well as the potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) contributing to these alterations were identified. The organic extracts of tap water had no significant (ant)agonistic activities against an estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) at enrichment concentrations of ≤10 times, posing no immediate or acute health risk to humans. However, the presence of agonistic activities against PR and MR and antagonistic activities against ER, PR, GR, and MR in OEs of tap water at relatively higher enrichment concentrations still raise potential health concerns. Boiling effectively reduced antagonistic activities against these steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) but increased estrogenic and glucocorticoid activities in drinking water. Four novel potential EDCs, including one UV filter (phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, PBSA) and three natural metabolites of organisms (beta-hydroxymyristic acid, 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, and isorosmanol) were identified in drinking water samples, each of which showed (ant)agonistic activities against different SHRs. Given the widespread use of UV filters in sunscreens to prevent skin cancer, the health risks posed by PBSA as an identified novel EDC are of concern. Although boiling has been thought to reduce the health risk of drinking water contamination, our findings suggest that boiling may have a more complex effect on the endocrine-disrupting activities of drinking water and, therefore, a more comprehensive assessment is needed.",PMC11054029

EDCs can activate or inhibit endogenous endocrine functions by binding hormone receptors, leading to potentially adverse effects. Conventional analytical methods can detect EDCs at a high sensitivity and precision, but are blind to the biological activity of the detected compounds. To overcome this limitation, yeast-based bioassays have previously been developed as a pre-screening method, providing an effect-based overview of hormonal-disruptive activity within the sample prior to the application of analytical methods. These yeast biosensors express human endocrine-specific receptors, co-transfected with the relevant response element fused to the specific fluorescent protein reporter gene. We describe several molecular manipulations of the sensor/reporter circuit in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae bioreporter strain that have yielded an enhanced detection of estrogenic-like compounds. Improved responses were displayed both in liquid culture (96-well plate format) as well as in conjunction with sample separation using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC).

Focused on hERRγ with 4-isopropylphenol, bisphenol-F (BPF), and BP(2,2)(Un) complexes, we executed molecular docking and multiple molecular dynamics (MD) simulations along with molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) and solvation interaction energy (SIE) calculation to study the detailed dynamical structural characteristics and interactions between them. Molecular docking showed that hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were the prime interactions to keep the stability of BPF-hERRγ and hERRγ-BP(2,2)(Un) complexes. Through MD simulations, we observed that all complexes reach equilibrium during the initial 50 ns of simulation, but these three EDCs lead to local structure changes in hERRγ. Energy results further identified key residues L268, V313, L345, and F435 around the binding pockets through CH-π, π-π, and hydrogen bonds interactions play an important stabilizing role in the recognition with EDCs. And most noticeable of all, hydrophobic methoxide groups in BP(2,2)(Un) is useful for decreasing the binding ability between EDCs and hERRγ. These results may contribute to evaluate latent diseases associated with EDCs exposure at the micro level and find potential substitutes. Autodock4.2 was used to conduct the molecular docking, sietraj program was performed to calculate the energy, and VMD software was used to visualize the structure.

BPA is an extensively studied high production volume endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) associated with a vast array of diseases. Prior risk assessments of BPA by EFSA as well as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have relied on industry-funded studies conducted under good laboratory practice protocols (GLP) requiring guideline end points and detailed record keeping, while also claiming to examine (but rejecting) thousands of published findings by academic scientists. Guideline protocols initially formalized in the mid-twentieth century are still used by many regulatory agencies. EFSA used a 21st century approach in its reassessment of BPA and conducted a transparent, but time-limited, systematic review that included both guideline and academic research. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) opposed EFSA's revision of the TDI for BPA. We identify the flaws in the assumptions that the German BfR, as well as the FDA, have used to justify maintaining the TDI for BPA at levels above what a vast amount of academic research shows to cause harm. We argue that regulatory agencies need to incorporate 21st century science into chemical hazard identifications using the CLARITY-BPA (Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity) nonguideline academic studies in a collaborative government-academic program model. We strongly endorse EFSA's revised TDI for BPA and support the European Commission's (EC) apparent acceptance of this updated BPA risk assessment. We discuss challenges to current chemical risk assessment assumptions about EDCs that need to be addressed by regulatory agencies to, in our opinion, become truly protective of public health. Addressing these challenges will hopefully result in BPA, and eventually other structurally similar bisphenols (called regrettable substitutions) for which there are known adverse effects, being eliminated from all food-related and many other uses in the EU and elsewhere. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13812.",PMC11003459

To date, a comprehensive screening approach for eEDCs affecting all ER dimer forms in live cells is lacking. Here, we developed ER dimerization-detecting biosensors (ERDDBs), based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, for dimerization detection and rapid eEDC identification. To enhance the performance of these biosensors, we determined optimal donor and acceptor locations using computational analysis. Additionally, employing HaloTag as the acceptor and incorporating the P2A peptide as a linker yielded the highest sensitivity among the prototypes. We also established stable cell lines to screen potential ER dimerization inducers among estrogen analogs (EAs).

The most common route of exposure to BPA is oral, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is, therefore, the first body system to be exposed to BPA. BPA has been well-documented to impair gut contractility in rats, in vitro. It may therefore be hypothesized that BPA may adversely affect GI motility and hence slow down the movement of food, resulting in the increased transit of food bolus in the GI tract. There are no reports so far on the effects of BPA on GI transit time. Objectives The present study was undertaken to examine the impact of exposure to BPA by a single oral dose (termed as short-term ingestion of BPA) and chronic (28-day) oral dose (termed as long-term ingestion of BPA) on the transit time of food bolus in the gut of adult male albino rats. Methods and materials The study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. In one set of experiments, each animal was fed a food pellet, once (short-term ingestion) containing BPA (2 µg/kg and 50 µg/kg in different groups), and in another set of experiments, each animal was fed a food pellet containing BPA (50 µg/kg/day) for 28 consecutive days (long-term ingestion). Control rats in both sets were fed food pellets without BPA. Subsequently, the gastric transit index (GTI), ileocecal transit index (ICTI), and colonic transit time (CTT) were determined by the standard charcoal marker method. Results One-time ingestion of a food pellet containing BPA caused a significant (p < 0.05) drop in the GTI and ICTI and an increase in the CTT with both doses of BPA (2 and 50 µg/kg). Similarly, after chronic (28-day), oral BPA exposure, a significant decrease in the GTI and ICTT and an increase in CTT were observed. Conclusion Both short-term (one-time) and long-term (28-day) oral exposure to BPA-containing food harmed GI transit. Slow GI transit may lead to metabolic disorders and GI motility disorders, such as constipation.",PMC10918301

Therefore, we evaluated associations between exposure to a mixture of 18 EDCs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), brominated flame retardants, and organochlorine pesticides, and risk of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the most common thyroid cancer histological subtype. We conducted a nested case-control study among U.S. military servicemembers of 652 histologically-confirmed PTC cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2013 and 652 controls, matched on birth year, sex, race/ethnicity, military component (active duty/reserve), and serum sample timing. We estimated mixture odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and standard errors (SE) for associations between pre-diagnostic serum EDC mixture concentrations, overall PTC risk, and risk of histological subtypes of PTC (classical, follicular), adjusted for body mass index and military branch, using quantile g-computation. Additionally, we identified relative contributions of individual mixture components to PTC risk, represented by positive and negative weights (w). A one-quartile increase in the serum mixture concentration was associated with a non-statistically significant increase in overall PTC risk (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 0.91, 1.56; SE = 0.14). Stratified by histological subtype and race (White, Black), a one-quartile increase in the mixture was associated with increased classical PTC risk among those of White race (OR = 1.59; 95% CI = 1.06, 2.40; SE = 0.21), but not of Black race (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.34, 2.68; SE = 0.53).

Phytic acid-cross-linked Baker's yeast cyclodextrin polymer composites (IBY-PA-CDP) were prepared using a one-pot method. IBY-PA-CDP was used to adsorb methylene blue (MB), bisphenol A (BPA), and methyl orange (MO). Studies on the ionic strength and strongly acidic ion salts confirmed that IBY-PA-CDP adsorbs MO through hydrophobic interactions. This also shows that Na+ was the direct cause of the increased MO removal. Adsorption studies on binary systems showed that MB/MO inhibited the adsorption of BPA by IBY-PA-CDP. The presence of MB increased the removal rate of MO by IBY-PA-CDP due to the bridging effect. The Langmuir isotherm model calculated the maximum adsorption capacities for MB and BPA to be 630.96 and 83.31 mg g-1, respectively. However, the Freundlich model is more suitable for fitting the experimental data for MO adsorption. To understand the rate-limiting stage of adsorption, a mass-transfer mechanism model was employed.

We analyzed publicly-available data from a high-risk cohort of mothers and their children (2007-2014) that measured six EDCs including methyl-, ethyl- and propyl parabens (MEPB, ETPB, PRPB), Bisphenol-A (BPA), 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy), 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) in prenatal urine samples during the second and third trimesters. Neurodevelopmental scores were assessed using Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) at age 3. We used mean field variational Bayes for lagged kernel machine regression (MFVB-LKMR) to investigate the association between trimester-specific co-exposure to the six EDCs and MSEL scores at age 3, stratified by sex. The analysis included 130 children. For females, the relationship between BPA and 3PBA with MSEL score varied between the two trimesters. In the second trimester, effect estimates for BPA were null but inversely correlated with MSEL score in the third trimester. 3PBA had a negative relationship with MSEL in the second trimester and positive correlation in the third trimester. For males, effect estimates for all EDCs were in opposing directions across trimesters. MFVB-LKMR analysis identified significant two-way interaction between EDCs for MSEL scores in both trimesters. For example, in females, the MSEL scores associated with increased exposure to TCPy were 1.75 units (95%credible interval -0.04, -3.47) lower in the 2nd trimester and 4.61 (95%CI -3.39, -5.84) lower in the third trimester when PRPB was fixed at the 75th percentile compared to when PRPB was fixed at the 25th percentile.

Global DNA methylation analysis revealed that gestational exposure to BPA resulted in DNA hypomethylation in the uterus. Progesterone receptor (PR) protein expression in uterine tissues was monitored using western blot analysis, which revealed that the PR protein content was considerably higher in all BPA-exposed groups than in the control. Immunohistochemical examination for the PR revealed that intense PR-positive cells were more frequently observed in the BPA-exposed group than in the control group. To date, the evidence that the upregulation of PRs observed in the present study was caused by the non-methylation of specific PR promoter regions is lacking.

The release of DEHP under various conditions, including exposure to aqueous and organic solvents, different temperatures, and household microwaves, was investigated. The amount of DEHP released from both laboratory-produced PVC films and commercially available PVC products was measured to elucidate the potential risks associated with its real-world applications. Furthermore, tests were performed to evaluate cytotoxicity using estrogen-dependent and -independent cancer cell lines. The results revealed a dose-dependent impact on estrogen-dependent cells, thus emphasizing the potential health implications of phthalate release. This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the migration patterns of DEHP from PVC products and forms a basis for further research on the safety of PVC and plasticizers.",PMC10818930

However, the studies conducted so far provide contrasting results. Our study aimed to investigate the associations between PCB serum and semen levels and semen quality in high school and university students living in a highly PCB-polluted area of Italy. Subjects with a normal body mass index who did not make daily use of tobacco, alcohol, drugs, or medication were selected. All participants provided a fasting blood and a semen sample. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the concentrations of 26 PCB congeners. The concentrations of PCB functional groups and total PCBs were also computed. A total of 143 subjects (median age 20, range 18-22 years) were enrolled. The median total PCB concentrations were 3.85 ng/mL (range 3.43-4.56 ng/mL) and 0.29 ng/mL (range 0.26-0.32 ng/mL) in serum and semen, respectively. The analysis of the associations between sperm PCB concentration and semen parameters showed (a) negative associations between some PCB congeners, functional groups and total PCBs and sperm total motility; (b) negative associations of total PCBs with sperm normal morphology; and (c) no association of PCBs with sperm concentration. Subjects at the highest quartile of semen total PCB concentration had 19% and 23% mean reductions in total motility and normal morphology, respectively, compared to those at the lowest quartile. The analysis of the associations of serum PCB levels with sperm parameters yielded null or mixed (some positive, other negative) results. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence of a negative effect of some PCB congeners and total PCBs in semen on sperm motility and normal morphology. However, the associations between the concentration of serum and semen PCB congeners and functional groups and sperm quality parameters were inconsistent.",PMC10820147

For this, three tequila factories (small, medium, and large) were monitored. DEHP concentrations in water, agave, additives, lubricating greases, neoprene seals, and materials of each stage process were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. DEHP mass balances were performed to identify the processes with significant changes in the inputs/outputs. DEHP was detected in agave at up to 0.08 ± 0.03 mg kg-1, water 0.02 ± 0.01 mg kg-1, lubricant greases 131.05 ± 2.80 mg kg-1, and neoprene seals 369.11 ± 22.52 mg kg-1. Whereas, tequila produced in the large, medium, and small factories contained 0.05 ± 0.01, 0.24 ± 0.04, and 1.43 ± 0.48 mg kg-1 DEHP, respectively. Furthermore, in waste materials (vinasses and bagasse) released, 534.26 ± 349.02, 947.18 ± 65.84, and 5222.60 ± 2836.94 mg of DEHP was detected for every 1000 L of tequila produced. The most significant increase in DEHP occurred during the sugar extraction and distillation stages. Results demonstrate that main raw materials, such as agave and water, contain DEHP, but lubricant greases and neoprene seals are the major sources of DEHP contamination. Identification of the contamination sources can help the tequila industry to take actions to reduce it, protect consumer health and the environment, and prevent circular contamination.",PMC10814815

PCBs are widely known to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and have been found to be involved in several diseases/disorders. This study takes various molecular descriptors of these PCBs (e.g., molecular weight) and toxicity endpoints as molecular activities, investigating the possibility of correlations via the quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR). This study then focuses on molecular docking and dynamics to investigate the docking behavior of the strongest-binding PCBs to nuclear receptors and compares these to the docking behavior of their natural ligands. Nuclear receptors are a family of transcription factors activated by steroid hormones, and they have been investigated to consider the impact of PCBs on humans in this context. It has been observed that the docking affinity of PCBs is comparable to that of the natural ligands, but they are inferior in terms of stability and interacting forces, as shown by the RMSD and total energy values. However, it is noted that most nuclear receptors respond to PCBs similarly to how they respond to their natural ligands-as shown in the RMSF plots-the most similar of which are seen in the ER, THR-β, and RAR-α.

Women also provided up-to-five first-morning urine samples monthly across pregnancy (8-40 weeks), which we pooled to measure 19 phthalate/replacement metabolites (reflecting ten parent compounds), three parabens, and six phenols. We used linear regression to evaluate overall and fetal sex-specific associations of biomarkers with hormones, as well as weighted quantile sum and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to assess cumulative associations, non-linearities, and chemical interactions. In women of relatively high socioeconomic status, several EDC biomarkers were associated with select hormones, without cumulative or non-linear associations with progesterone, FT4, or TT4. The biomarker mixture was negatively associated with estradiol (only at higher biomarker concentrations using BKMR), testosterone, and TSH, where each 10% mixture increase was associated with -5.65% (95% CI: -9.79, -1.28) lower testosterone and -0.09 μIU/mL (95% CI: -0.20, 0.00) lower TSH.

When children were ages 4-6 years, mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), from which a Total Problems score was calculated. Mothers additionally provided recall on their exposure to 14 PSLEs during pregnancy.

We subsequently refitted models stratified by child sex. Secondarily, we fit linear and logistic regression models examining individual phthalate metabolites. In our main, fully adjusted models (n = 1536 mother-child dyads), we observed some evidence of weak main effects of phthalate mixtures on problem behaviors in the full cohort and stratified by child sex. Interaction models revealed unexpected relationships whereby greater gestational exposure to PSLEs predicted reduced associations between some phthalates (e.g., the metabolites of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, di-n-octyl phthalate, di-iso-nonyl phthalate) and problem behaviors, particularly in males.

Identifying chemicals with these activities can prompt steps to protect human health. We compiled data on rodent tumors, endocrine activity, and genotoxicity to assess the key characteristics (KCs) of rodent mammary carcinogens (MCs), and to identify other chemicals that exhibit these effects and may therefore increase BC risk. Using authoritative databases, including International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs and the US Environmental Protection's (EPA) ToxCast, we selected chemicals that induce mammary tumors in rodents, stimulate estradiol or progesterone synthesis, or activate the estrogen receptor (ER) in vitro. We classified these chemicals by their genotoxicity and strength of endocrine activity and calculated the overrepresentation (enrichment) of these KCs among MCs. Finally, we evaluated whether these KCs predict whether a chemical is likely to induce mammary tumors. We identified 279 MCs and an additional 642 chemicals that stimulate estrogen or progesterone signaling. MCs were significantly enriched for steroidogenicity, ER agonism, and genotoxicity, supporting the use of these KCs to predict whether a chemical is likely to induce rodent mammary tumors and, by inference, increase BC risk. More MCs were steroidogens than ER agonists, and many increased both estradiol and progesterone. Enrichment among MCs was greater for strong endocrine activity vs. weak or inactive, with a significant trend. We identified hundreds of compounds that have biological activities that could increase BC risk and demonstrated that these activities are enriched among MCs. We argue that many of these should not be considered low hazard without investigating their ability to affect the breast, and chemicals with the strongest evidence can be targeted for exposure reduction. We describe ways to strengthen hazard identification, including improved assessments for mammary effects, developing assays for more KCs, and more comprehensive chemical testing. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP13233.",PMC10777819

Toward this, the ToxCast project has generated the largest resource on the chemical-receptor activity data for environmental chemicals that were screened across various endocrine receptors. However, the heterogeneity in the multitarget structure-activity landscape of such chemicals is not yet explored. In this study, we systematically curated the chemicals targeting eight human endocrine receptors, their activity values, and biological end points from the ToxCast chemical library. We employed dual-activity difference and triple-activity difference maps to identify single-, dual-, and triple-target cliffs across different target combinations. We annotated the identified activity cliffs through the matched molecular pair (MMP)-based approach and observed that a small fraction of activity cliffs form MMPs. Further, we structurally classified the activity cliffs and observed that R-group cliffs form the highest fraction among the cliffs identified in various target combinations. Finally, we leveraged the mechanism of action (MOA) annotations to analyze structure-mechanism relationships and identified strong MOA-cliffs and weak MOA-cliffs, for each of the eight endocrine receptors.

The combination of diet, lifestyle and the exposure to dietary xenobiotics categorised into microbiota-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) could determine obesogenic-related dysbiosis. This modification of the microbiota diversity impacts on individual health-disease balance, inducing altered phenotypes. Specific, complementary, and combined prevention and treatments are needed to face these altered microbial patterns and the specific misbalances triggered. In this sense, searching for next-generation probiotics (NGP) by microbiota culturing, and focusing on their demonstrated, extensive scope and well-defined functions could contribute to counteracting and repairing the effects of obesogens. Therefore, EU-FORA project contributes to present a perspective through compiling information and key strategies for directed taxa searching and culturing of NGP that could be administered for preventing obesity and endocrine-related dysbiosis by (i) observing the differential abundance of specific microbiota taxa in obesity-related patients and analysing their functional roles, (ii) developing microbiota-directed strategies for culturing these taxa groups, and (iii) design and applying the successful compiled criteria from recent NGP clinical studies. New isolated or cultivable microorganisms from healthy gut microbiota specifically related to xenobiotic obesogens' neutralisation effects might be used as an NGP single strain or in consortia, both presenting functions and the ability to palliate metabolic-related disorders. Identification of holistic approaches for searching and using potential NGP, key aspects, the bias, gaps and proposals of solutions were also considered in this workplan.",PMC10687753

This meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the relationship between EEDs and thyroid cancer. We searched for epidemiological studies on EEDs and thyroid cancer published in PubMed and Web of Science up to December 2022. We then screened the articles that could extract data on EEDs concentration levels in both thyroid cancer patients and healthy controls. We excluded articles that could not calculate effect sizes, focused on other thyroid diseases, or lacked controls. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to analyze the association between EEDs and thyroid cancer. We measured the heterogeneity among the included studies using I2, assessed publication bias by Egger's and Begg's test, and evaluated article quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Score (NOS). In the end, fifteen eligible case-control studies were included. Our comprehensive analysis revealed that polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were negatively associated with thyroid cancer{ SMD = -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (-0.05, -0.00), P = 0.03}, while polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates (PAEs), and heavy metals were positively associated with thyroid cancer{PBDEs: SMD = 0.14, 95%CI = (0.04, 0.23), P = 0.007; PAEs: SMD = 0.30, 95%CI = (0.02, 0.58), P = 0.04; heavy metals: SMD = 0.21, 95%CI = (0.11, 0.32), P < 0.001}. We did not find a statistically significant relationship between bisphenol A (BPA) and thyroid cancer. Most of the included studies did not show publication bias, except for those on PCBs. Our results indicate that exposure to certain EEDs, such as PBDEs, PAEs, and heavy metals, increases the risk of thyroid cancer.

Epidemiological studies suggest that endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure is positively associated with individual components of MetS, but evidence of an association between EDCs and MetS remains inconsistent. In a cross-sectional analysis within the Multiethnic Cohort Study, we evaluated the association between 4 classes of urinary EDCs (bisphenol A [BPA], triclosan, parabens, and phthalates) and MetS among 1728 women.

Emerging evidence suggested that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have the potential to interfere with the function of normal hormones, may play a crucial role in this trend. However, the potential relationships were inconsistent in various studies. In our study, we sought to fully evaluate the currently available epidemiological evidence to ascertain whether certain EDC congeners and their metabolites are related to breast cancer risk. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in three electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Publications that covered xenobiotic EDC exposures and breast cancer-confirmed histological results or antecedent medical records or reporting to health registers were taken into consideration. The final result of the literature search was 6,498 references, out which we found 67 publications that matched the requirements for meta-analysis and eight publications for qualitative trend synthesis.

BPA exposure causes hormonal disruption and alters mitochondrial dynamics and activity, ultimately leading to decreased male fertility. As public health concerns following BPA exposure are rising globally, there is a need to understand the exact mechanisms of BPA on various diseases. BPA exposure causes hormonal imbalances and affects male fertility by binding the estrogen receptors (ERs), but the mechanism of how it mediates the hormonal dysregulation is yet to be studied. This study consisted of a comparative study using mice that were separated into a control group and a group exposed to the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) (n = 20 mice/group) after a week of acclimatization to the environment. For this study, the LOAEL established by the US Environmental Protection Agency of 50 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day of BPA was used. The control mice were given corn oil orally. Based on the daily variations in BW, both groups were gavaged every day from 6 to 11 weeks (6-week exposure). Before sampling, mice were stabilized for a week. Then, the testes and spermatozoa of each mouse were collected to investigate the effects of BPA on male fertility. IVF was carried out using the cumulus-oocyte complexes from female hybrid B6D2F1/CrljOri mice (n = 3) between the ages of eight and twelve weeks. Signaling pathways, apoptosis, and mitochondrial activity/dynamics-related proteins were evaluated by western blotting. ELISA was performed to determine the levels of sex hormones (FSH, LH, and testosterone) in serum. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to determine the effects of BPA on histological morphology and stage VII/VIII testicular seminiferous epithelium. Blastocyst formation and cleavage development rate were evaluated using IVF. BPA acted by binding to ERs and G protein-coupled receptors and activating the protein kinase A and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, leading to aberrant hormone levels and effects on the respiratory chain complex, ATP synthase and protein-related apoptotic pathways in testis mitochondria (P < 0.05). Subsequently, embryo cleavage and blastocyst formation were reduced after the use of affected sperm, and abnormal morphology of seminiferous tubules and stage VII and VIII seminiferous epithelial cells (P < 0.05) was observed. It is noteworthy that histopathological lesions were detected in the testes at the LOAEL dose, even though the mice remained generally healthy and did not exhibit significant changes in BW following BPA exposure. These observations suggest that testicular toxicity is more than a secondary outcome of compromised overall health in the mice due to systemic effects. Not applicable. Since the protein expression levels in the testes were validated, in vitro studies in each testicular cell type (Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and spermatogonial stem cells) would be required to shed further light on the exact mechanism resulting from BPA exposure. Furthermore, the BPA doses employed in this study significantly exceed the typical human exposure levels in real-life scenarios. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct experiments focusing on the effects of BPA concentrations more in line with daily human exposures to comprehensively assess their impact on testicular toxicity and mitochondrial activity. These findings demonstrate that BPA exposure impacts male fertility by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics and activities in the testes and provides a solid foundation for subsequent investigations into the effects on male reproductive function and fertility following BPA exposure, and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects. In addition, these findings suggest that the LOAEL concentration of BPA demonstrates exceptional toxicity, especially when considering its specific impact on the testes and its adverse consequences for male fertility by impairing mitochondrial activity. Therefore, it is plausible to suggest that BPA elicits distinct toxicological responses and mechanistic endpoints based on the particular concentration levels for each target organ.

Our purpose was testing the estrogenic effects using a dual approach. As an effect-based, holistic method, we developed and used the YES (yeast estrogen screen) test employing the genetically modified Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ3505 strain which contains human estrogenic receptor. For testing exact molecules, UHPLC-FLD was used. Our study points out that slurry contains a growing amount of EDCs with the risk of penetrating into the soil, crops and the food chain. Considering the Green Chemistry concept, the most benign ways to prevent of the pollution of the slurry is choosing appropriate oestrus-inducing veterinary pharmaceuticals (OIVPs) and the separation of the solid and liquid parts with adequate treatment methods. To our knowledge, this is the first paper on the adaptation of the YES test for medicine and slurry samples, extending its applicability.

Thus, aim of this study was to evaluate effects of Cd on Luminal A BC estrogen receptor (ER) positive/progesterone receptor positive cell models in vitro to characterize the mechanism(s) involved in breast cell homeostasis disruption. T47D and MCF7 were exposed to Cd (0.5-1 µM) for 6-24 h to evaluate potential alterations in: cells viability, steroid receptors and intracellular signaling by western blot. Moreover, we evaluated the expression of inflammatory cytokines interleukin by RT-PCR. Our results showed a significant induction of androgen receptor (AR) and an increased AR/ER ratio. Further, Cd exposure increased pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)6, IL8 and tumor necrosis factor α levels. Finally, as previously demonstrated by our group, Cd alters pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase family and protein kinase B.

We applied Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and Bayesian penalized horseshoe regression for variable selection and then built multivariate generalized propensity score (mvGPS) models to provide an overview of the effects of selected EDCs on metabolic outcomes.

While estrogen receptor (ERα) expression in the epithelium is essential for normal gland development, the role of this receptor in the stroma is less clear. Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that mouse phenotypes of in utero exposure to endocrine disruption act through mesenchymal ERα in the developing fetus. We utilized a Twist2-cre mouse line to knock out mesenchymal ERα. Herein, we assessed mammary gland development in the context of mesenchymal ERα deletion. We also tested the effect of in utero bisphenol A (BPA) exposure to alter the tumor susceptibility in the mouse mammary tumor virus-neu (MMTV-neu) breast cancer mouse model. Mesenchymal ERα deletion resulted in altered reproductive tract development and atypical cytology associated with estrous cycling. The mammary gland demonstrated mature epithelial extension unlike complete ERα-knockout mice, but ductal extension was delayed and reduced compared to ERα-competent mice. Using the MMTV-Neu cancer susceptibility model, ERα-intact mice exposed to BPA had reduced tumor-free survival and overall survival compared to BPA-exposed mice having mesenchymal ERα deletion. This difference is specific for BPA exposure as vehicle-treated animals had no difference in tumor development between mice expressing and not expressing mesenchymal ERα. These data demonstrate that mesenchymal ERα expression is not required for ductal extension, nor does it influence cancer risk in this mouse model but does influence the cancer incidence associated with in utero BPA exposure.",PMC10698735

Studies have mainly focused on individual aspects of growth at specific time points using single chemical exposure models. However, humans are exposed to multiple EDCs simultaneously, and growth is a dynamic process. The objective of this study was to evaluate the associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and children's body mass index (BMI) growth trajectories using single exposure and mixture modeling approaches. Using data from the INfancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) Spanish birth cohort (n=1,911), prenatal exposure to persistent chemicals [hexachlorobenzene (HCB), 4-4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB-138, -150, and -180), 4 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)] and nonpersistent chemicals (8 phthalate metabolites, 7 phenols) was assessed using blood and spot urine concentrations. BMI growth trajectories were calculated from birth to 9 years of age using latent class growth analysis. Multinomial regression was used to assess associations for single exposures, and Bayesian weighted quantile sum (BWQS) regression was used to evaluate the EDC mixture's association with child growth trajectories. In single exposure models exposure to HCB, DDE, PCBs, and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were associated with increased risk of belonging to a trajectory of lower birth size followed by accelerated BMI gain by 19%-32%, compared with a trajectory of average birth size and subsequent slower BMI gain [e.g., relative risk ratio (RRR) per doubling in DDE concentration=1.19 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.35); RRR for PFNA=1.32 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.66)]. HCB and DDE exposure were also associated with higher probability of belonging to a trajectory of higher birth size and accelerated BMI gain. Results from the BWQS regression showed the mixture was positively associated with increased odds of belonging to a BMI trajectory of lower birth size and accelerated BMI gain (odds ratio per 1-quantile increase of the mixture=1.70; credible interval: 1.03, 2.61), with HCB, DDE, and PCBs contributing the most. This study provides evidence that prenatal EDC exposure, particularly persistent EDCs, may lead to BMI trajectories in childhood characterized by accelerated BMI gain.

The impact of metabolism was also evaluated. The YES/YAS assays exhibited a high sensitivity for ER effects and, despite some challenges in predicting AR effects, is a good initial screening assay. Results from receptor-binding and CALUX assays generally correlated and were in accordance with classifications based on ToxCast assays. ER agonism and AR antagonism of benzyl butyl phthalate were abolished when CALUX assays included liver S9. In silico final calls were mostly in agreement with the in vitro assays, and predicted ER and AR effects well.

We also exposed the human thyroid follicular epithelial cell line Nthy-ori 3-1 to 1 µM of DEHP or DINP for 5 days and analyzed changes in chromatin accessibility via ATAC-Seq. Dose-series analysis showed how the expression of several genes increased or decreased at the highest dose tested.

These changes in fatty acid oxidation and oxidative stress-related metabolites were correlated with hepatic changes including microvesicular steatosis, hepatocyte swelling, inflammation. In contrast to females, we observed fewer metabolic alterations in male offspring, which were uniquely found in preconception-only low dose DEHP exposure group. Although we found that preconception-gestational-lactation exposure causes the most liver pathology, we surprisingly found preconception exposure linked to an abnormal liver metabolome. We also found that two doses exhibited non-monotonic DEHP-induced changes in the liver. Collectively, these findings suggest that metabolic changes in the adult liver of offspring exposed periconceptionally to DHEP depends on the timing of exposure, dose, and sex.",PMC10842112

This work aimed to determine if PCBs were associated with circulating miRNAs and whether there were any correlations with serum PCB/miRNA levels and hormonal changes. 29 non-obese PCOS and 29 healthy control women, with similar age and body mass index (BMI), had their serum miRNAs measured together with 7 indicator PCBs (PCB28, PCB52, PCB101, PCB118, PCB138, PCB153, PCB180) using high resolution gas chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry. In the combined study cohort, four miRNAs (hsa-miR-139-5p, hsa-miR-424-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p) correlated with PCBs, but none correlated with metabolic parameters. hsa-miR-335-5p correlated with FSH. When stratified, 25 miRNAs correlated with PCBs in controls compared to only one (hsa-miR-193a-5p) in PCOS; none of these miRNAs correlated with the metabolic parameters of BMI, insulin resistance, or inflammation (C-reactive protein, CRP). However, of these 25 miRNAs in controls, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-193a-5p, hsa-miR-2110 and hsa-miR-195-5p positively correlated with luteinizing hormone (LH), hsa-miR-99b-5p and hsa-miR-146b-5p correlated with estradiol, hsa-miR-193a-5p correlated with progesterone, hsa-miR-195-5p correlated with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and hsa-miR-139-5p and hsa-miR-146b-5p negatively correlated with anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) (all p<0.05). hsa-miR-193a-5p in PCOS cases correlated with estradiol. In this cohort of women, with no difference in age and BMI, and with similar PCB levels, the miRNAs correlating to PCBs associated with menstrual cycle factors in healthy menstruating controls versus the anovulatory PCOS subjects. The PCB-associated miRNAs did not correlate with non-reproductive hormonal and metabolic parameters. This suggests that PCB effects on miRNAs may result in changes to the hypothalamo-ovarian axis that may thus affect fertility.",PMC10544902

Prenatal exposure to BPA has been associated with negative neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in children and rodent models. Prenatal BPA exposure has also been shown to impair postnatal maternal care provisioning, which can also affect offspring neurodevelopment and behavior. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the biological effects of prenatal exposure to bisphenols other than BPA and the interplay between prenatal BP exposure and postnatal maternal care on adult behavior. The purpose of the current study was to determine the interactive impact of prenatal BP exposure and postnatal maternal care on neurodevelopment and behavior. Our findings suggest that the effects of prenatal BP exposure on eye-opening, adult attentional set shifting and anxiety-like behavior in the open field are dependent on maternal care in the first five days of life. Interestingly, maternal care might also attenuate the effects of prenatal BP exposure on eye opening and adult attentional set shifting. Finally, transcriptomic profiles in male and female medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala suggest that the interactive effects of prenatal BP exposure and postnatal maternal care converge on estrogen receptor signaling and are involved in biological processes related to gene expression and protein translation and synthesis. Overall, these findings indicate that postnatal maternal care plays a critical role in the expression of the effects of prenatal BP exposure on neurodevelopment and adult behavior. Understanding the underlying biological mechanisms involved might allow us to identify potential avenues to mitigate the adverse effects of prenatal BP exposure and improve health and well-being in human populations.",PMC10541647

Among phthalates, di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) is a low-molecular-weight phthalate used as a component of many cosmetic products, such as nail polish, and other perfumed personal care products. DBP has toxic effects on reproductive health, inducing testicular damage and developmental malformations. Inside the male reproductive system, the prostate gland reacts to both male and female sex steroids. For this reason, it represents an important target of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), compounds that are able to affect the estrogen and androgen signaling pathways, thus interfering with prostate homeostasis and inducing several prostate pathologies. The aim of this project was to investigate the effects of DBP, alone and in combination with testosterone (T), 17β-estradiol (E2), and both, on the normal PNT1A human prostate cell-derived cell line, to mimic environmental contamination. We showed that DBP and all of the tested mixtures increase cell viability through activation of both estrogen receptor α (ERα) and androgen receptor (AR). DBP modulated steroid receptor levels in a nonmonotonic way, and differently to endogenous hormones. In addition, DBP translocated ERα to the nucleus over different durations and for a more prolonged time than E2, altering the normal responsiveness of prostate cells. However, DBP alone seemed not to influence AR localization, but AR was continuously and persistently activated when DBP was used in combination. Our results show that DBP alone, and in mixture, alters redox homeostasis in prostate cells, leading to a greater increase in cell oxidative susceptibility. In addition, we also demonstrate that DBP increases the migratory potential of PNT1A cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that DBP, alone and in mixtures with endogenous steroid hormones, acts as an EDC, resulting in an altered prostate cell physiology and making these cells more prone to cancer transformation.",PMC10531810

Due to their high lipophilicity and low biodegradability, these compounds remain in the environment and enter the human body through the food chain. Growing concerns regarding the potential negative effects of NP, NP1EO, and NP2EO on human health have raised the need for biomonitoring to investigate human exposure to these compounds. In this study, a simultaneous analysis method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was established by controlling the background contamination of NP, NP1EO, and NP2EO, which are ubiquitous in laboratory environments. The proposed method showed proper linearity of over 0.999 and a recovery greater than 85.8% for all analytes. Accuracy and precision were verified in ranges of 92.97-116.30% and 0.65-9.29%, respectively. The detection limits for NP, NP1EO, and NP2EO were 0.0363 μg L-1, 0.0401 μg L-1, and 0.0364 μg L-1, respectively, which were suitable for determining the trace analytes in human urine. Therefore, this simple and integrated analytical method was applied to measure the free and total forms of the target analytes in 25 human urine samples collected in Korea. Overall, free NP, NP1EO, and NP2EO were detected with average contents of 3.94 ± 4.14 μg L-1, 4.63 ± 2.62 μg L-1, and 0.293 ± 0.638 μg L-1, respectively, and with total NP, NP1EO, and NP2EO contents of 6.14 ± 8.24 μg L-1, 5.99 ± 2.91 μg L-1, and 0.806 ± 1.10 μg L-1, respectively.

EDs can interfere with endogenous hormones at different levels, resulting in numerous adverse human health outcomes, including immunotoxicity. In this regard, this study aimed to investigate in vitro the possible effects of EDs on immune cells and possible gender differences. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy humans, both males and females, were exposed to 6 different EDs, namely atrazine (herbicide), cypermethrin (insecticide), diethyl phthalate (plasticizer), 17α-ethynylestradiol (contraceptive drug), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (persistent organic pollutant), and vinclozolin (fungicide). We evaluated the effect of EDs on RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1) expression, considering it as a bridge between the endocrine and the immune system, and putatively used as screening tool of immunotoxic effects of EDs. The exposure to EDs resulted at different extent in alteration in RACK1 expression, pro-inflammatory activity, natural killer lytic ability, and lymphocyte differentiation, with sex-related differences.

It penetrates living organisms and shows multidirectional adverse influence on many internal organs. For this reason, BPA is often replaced in plastic production by other substances. One of them is bisphenol S (BPS), whose effects on the enteric nervous system (ENS) have not been explained. Therefore, the present study compares the influence of BPA and BPS on the number of enteric neurons immunoreactive to cocaine-and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide located in the ENS of the stomach, jejunum and colon with the use of double immunofluorescence method. The obtained results have shown that both bisphenols studied induced an increase in the number of CART-positive enteric neurons, and the severity of changes depended on the type of enteric ganglion, the dose of bisphenols and the segment of the digestive tract. The most visible changes were noted in the myenteric ganglia in the colon. Moreover, in the colon, the changes submitted by BPS are more noticeable than those observed after BPA administration. In the stomach and jejunum, bisphenol-induced changes were less visible, and changes caused by BPS were similar or less pronounced than those noted under the impact of BPA, depending on the segment of the gastrointestinal tract and ganglion type studied. The results show that BPS affects the enteric neurons containing CART in a similar way to BPA, and the BPS impact is even stronger in the colon.

It is reported that BpA exposure induces lipid accumulation in humans, similar to obesogenic compounds. The main objective of this study is to investigate the removal of BpA using Lactiplantibacillus sp. D10-2, and to examine its potential for reducing BpA-induced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cell line model. The heat-dried cells of Lactiplantibacillus sp. D10-2 showed 69.7% removal efficiency for initial BpA concentration of 10 μg/mL, which was 30.5% higher than the live cells. The absence of metabolites or intermediates in BpA removal studies indicates that the Lactiplantibacillus sp. D10-2 strain removed BpA by adsorption process. The hydrophobic interactions of heat-dried Lactiplantibacillus sp. D10-2 cells were observed to be higher with 33.7% compared to live cells (15.0%), suggesting a stronger ability to bind with BpA. Although the BpA binding onto Lactiplantibacillus sp. D10-2 was not affected by pH, it was confirmed that as the temperature increases, the binding ability got decreased due to mass transfer and diffusion of BpA molecules. Treatment with Lactiplantibacillus sp. D10-2 (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1%) reduced lipid accumulation by 61.7, 58.0, 52.7 and 60.4% in 3T3-L1 cells exposed with BpA. In addition, it was confirmed that Lactiplantibacillus sp. D10-2 treatment suppressed the protein expression levels of lipogenesis-related PPARγ and C/EBPα in 3T3-L1 cells.

While several materials exhibit excellent capacity for the photocatalytic degradation of BPA, their powdered nature and poor chemical stability render them unsuitable for practical application in large-scale water decontamination. In this study, a new class of nanocomposite membranes based on sulfonated polyethersulfone (sPES) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles (MWCNTs-TiO2) were investigated as efficient and scalable photocatalysts for the photodegradation of BPA in aqueous solutions. The MWCNTs-TiO2 hybrid material was prepared through a facile and inexpensive hydrothermal method and extensively characterized by XRD, Raman, FTIR, BET, and TGA. Meanwhile, nanocomposite membranes at different filler loadings were prepared by a simple casting procedure. Swelling tests and PFG NMR analyses provided insights into the impact of filler introduction on membrane hydrophilicity and water molecular dynamics, whereas the effectiveness of the various photocatalysts in BPA removal was monitored using HPLC. Among the different MWCNTs-TiO2 content nanocomposites, the one at 10 wt% loading (sP-MT10) showed the best photoactivity. Under UV irradiation at 254 nm and 365 nm for 240 min, photocatalytic oxidation of 5 mg/L bisphenol A by sP-MT10 resulted in 91% and 82% degradation, respectively. Both the effect of BPA concentration and the membrane regenerability were evaluated, revealing that the sP-MT10 maintained its maximum BPA removal capability over more than 10 cycles.

Herein, a total of 26 compounds, including steroids, flame retardants, and plasticizers, were monitored in three major and heavily urbanized river catchments: the R. Liffey (Ireland), the R. Thames (UK), and the R. Ter (Spain), by using a single solid-phase extraction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS/MS) method. Occurrence and frequency rates were investigated across all locations over a 10-week period, with the highest concentration obtained for the flame retardant tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) at 4767 ng∙L-1 in the R. Thames in Central London. Geographical variations were observed between sites and were partially explained using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). In particular, discrimination between the R. Ter and the R. Thames was observed based on the presence and concentration of flame retardants, benzotriazole, and steroids. Environmental risk assessment (ERA) across sites showed that caffeine, a chemical marker, and bisphenol A (BPA), a plasticizer, were classified as high-risk for the R. Liffey and R. Thames, based on relative risk quotients (rRQs), and that caffeine was classified as high-risk for the R. Ter, based on RQs. The total risks at each location, namely ΣRQriver, and ΣrRQriver, were: 361, 455, and 723 for the rivers Liffey, Thames, and Ter, respectively. Caffeine, as expected, was ubiquitous in all 3 urban areas, though with the highest RQ observed in the R. Ter. High contributions of BPA were also observed across the three matrices. Therefore, these two compounds should be prioritized independently of location. This study represents a comprehensive EDC monitoring comparison between different European cities based on a single analytical method, which allowed for a geographically independent ERA prioritization to be performed.",PMC10458904

The decrease in age at menarche observed during the past decades has been linked to an increased exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). Evidence for the association between PFAS and phthalate exposure and menarche onset, however, is inconsistent. We studied the association between PFAS and phthalate/DINCH exposure and age at menarche using data of 514 teenagers (12 to 18 years) from four aligned studies of the Human Biomonitoring for Europe initiative (HBM4EU): Riksmaten Adolescents 2016-2017 (Sweden), PCB cohort (follow-up; Slovakia), GerES V-sub (Germany), and FLEHS IV (Belgium). PFAS concentrations were measured in blood, and phthalate/DINCH concentrations in urine.

Untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed 17 biomarkers in the ovary of BPA lineage fish, whereas transcriptomic analysis revealed 292 genes abnormally expressed, which were similar to human patients with PCOS. Metabolomic-transcriptomic joint pathway analysis revealed activation of the cancerous pathway, arginine-proline metabolism, insulin signaling, AMPK, and HOTAIR regulatory pathways, as well as upstream regulators esr1 and tgf signaling in the ovary.

Its direct consequence is the release of endocrine disruptors, such as bisphenol A (BPA), and its emerging substitute molecules, bisphenol F and S (BPF and BPS), into the environment. Consequently, bisphenols are usually present in human biological fluids. Since BPA, BPS, and BPF have structural analogies and similar hormonal activity, their combined study is urgently needed. The present manuscript studied the effect of the mixture of bisphenols (BPmix) in one of the world's largest human cohorts (NHANES cohort). Descriptive and comparative statistics, binomial and multinomial logistic regression, weighted quantile sum regression, quantile g-computation, and Bayesian kernel machine regression analysis determined a positive association between BPmix and heart disease, including confounders age, gender, BMI, ethnicity, Poverty/Income Ratio, and serum cotinine. Endothelial dysfunction is a hallmark of cardiovascular disease; thus, the average ratio of bisphenols found in humans was used to conduct murine aortic endothelial cell studies. The first results showed that BPmix had a higher effect on cell viability than BPA, enhancing its deleterious biological action. However, the flow cytometry, Western blot, and immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that BPmix induces a differential effect on cell death. While BPA exposure induces necroptosis, its combination with the proportion determined in the NHANES cohort induces apoptosis.

Methods: Subjects were included in the case group (n = 107) who were diagnosed with endometriosis by postoperative pathology in Fujian Maternal and Child Hospital from February 2018 to February 2021, and the women who were excluded from endometriosis by surgery were as the control group (n = 70). The demographic information of the subjects were evaluated by questionnaire, and the clinical characteristics were evaluated by medical records and 3-year follow-up results.

Results: The human urinary levels of DMP (p < 0.001), MMP (p = 0.001), DEP (p = 0.003), MEP (p = 0.002), DBP (p = 0.041), MBP (p < 0.001), BBzP (p = 0.009), DEHP (p < 0.001), and MEHP (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in women with endometriosis than in controls. Notably, DEHP was a significant risk factor for endometriosis (OR: 11.0, 95% CI: 5.4-22.6). The area under the ROC curve increased when multiple phthalates were diagnosed jointly, reaching 0.974 as the highest value, which was helpful for the diagnosis of endometriosis. In vivo experiments showed that after DEHP exposure in rats, the mass index of the ovary and uterus decreased in a dose-dependent manner; the oestrus cycle of SD rats was irregularly prolonged and disordered; and the serum AMH level was negatively correlated with the DEHP exposure dose (Rho = -0.8, p < 0.001). Bioinformatics analysis of rat ovarian tissues showed that seven genes involved in the steroid biosynthesis pathway were upregulated and may play a negative role in ovarian function. Conclusion: Exposure to phthalates, especially DEHP, is associated with the occurrence of endometriosis and affects women's reproductive prognosis and ovarian function. The steroid biosynthesis pathway may be related to ovarian dysfunction. The detection of phthalate in urine may become a new biological target for the diagnosis of endometriosis.",PMC10407402

Numerous cell experiment studies have successfully utilized microfluidic channels to achieve various new scientific discoveries. However, it has been often overlooked that undesired and unnoticed propagation of cellular molecules in such bio-microfluidic channel systems can have a negative impact on the experimental results. Thus, more careful designing is required to minimize such unwanted issues through deeper understanding and careful control of chemically and physically predominant factors at the microscopic scale. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to improve microfluidic channel design, specifically targeting the mitigation of the aforementioned challenges. To minimize the occurrence of undesired cell positioning upstream from the main test section where a concentration gradient field locates, an additional narrow port structure was devised between the microfluidic upstream channel and each inlet reservoir. This port also functioned as a passive lock that hold the flow at rest via fluid-air surface tension, which facilitated manual movement of the device even when cell attachment was not achieved completely. To demonstrate the practicability of the system, we conducted experiments and diffusion simulations on the effect of endocrine disruptors on germ cells. To this end, a bisphenol-A (BPA) concentration gradient was generated in the main channel of the system at BPA concentrations ranging from 120.8 μM to 79.3 μM, and the proliferation of GC-1 cells in the BPA gradient environment was quantitatively evaluated. The features and concepts of the introduced design is to minimize unexpected and ignored error sources, which will be one of the issues to be considered in the development of microfluidic systems to explore extremely delicate cellular phenomena.",PMC10408176

However, little is known about the impact of OPEs on the adrenal, a vital endocrine gland. Here, we used a high-content screening approach to elucidate the effects of OPEs on H295R human adrenal cell phenotypic endpoints and function. The effects of 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a legacy brominated flame retardant, on H295R cell cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, mitochondria, lysosomes, and lipid droplets were compared with those of 6 OPEs. Most OPEs reduced oxidative stress, increased the numbers of mitochondria, decreased lysosomes, and increased lipid droplets. Two potency ranking approaches, the lowest benchmark concentration/administered equivalent dose methods and Toxicological Prioritization Index analyses, revealed that the triaryl-OPEs (isopropylated triphenyl phosphate [IPPP], tris(methylphenyl) phosphate [TMPP], and triphenyl phosphate [TPHP]) and 1 nontriaryl OPE (tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate [TDCIPP]) were more potent than BDE-47. The steroidogenic activity of adrenal cells in the presence or absence of forskolin, a steroidogenic stimulus, was determined after exposure to triaryl-OPEs. The basal production of cortisol and aldosterone was increased by IPPP but decreased by TPHP or TMPP exposure; the response to forskolin was not affected by these OPEs. All 3 triaryl OPEs altered the expression of rate-limiting enzymes involved in cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis; CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 were the most prominently affected targets. The OPE chemical-specific effects on cortisol and aldosterone production were best explained by alterations in STAR expression. Thus, the adrenal may be an important target for these endocrine-disrupting chemicals.",PMC10424175

In this regard, fungal bioremediation appears as a green and cost-effective approach to removing pollutants from water resources. Besides, immobilizing fungal cells onto nanofibrous membranes appears as an innovative strategy to improve remediation performance by allowing the adsorption and degradation to occur simultaneously. Herein, we developed a novel nanostructured bioremediation platform based on polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membrane (PAN NFM) as supporting material for immobilizing an endophytic fungus to remove bisphenol A (BPA), a typical EDC. The endophytic strain was isolated from Handroanthus impetiginosus leaves and identified as Phanerochaete sp. H2 by molecular methods. The successful assembly of fungus onto the PAN NFM surface was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Compared with free fungus cells, the PAN@H2 NFM displayed a high BPA removal efficiency (above 85%) at an initial concentration of 5 ppm, suggesting synergistic removal by simultaneous adsorption and biotransformation. Moreover, the biotransformation pathway was investigated, and the chemical structures of fungal metabolites of BPA were identified by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - high-resolution mass (UHPLC-HRMS) analysis. In general, our results suggest that by combining the advantages of enzymatic activity and nanofibrous structure, the novel platform has the potential to be applied in the bioremediation of varied EDCs or even other pollutants found in water resources.",5368684

The GO was first intercalated with 1-octanesulphonic acid sodium salt and subjected to microwave irradiation to produce GOBC. Fixed-bed column tests and Jar-tests were performed for removal of the most harmful endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) such as bisphenol A, bisphenol S, endosulphan, beta-estradiol, dyes (methylene blue and violate) and toxic metal ions such as Pb2+, Li+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cr6+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, and As5+via adsorption. The prepared material was thoroughly characterized for its unique functional and structural properties. The results obtained from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, water contact angle and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the successful preparation of GOBC using the proposed intercalation/microwave method. The water contact angle results showed decreased hydrophilicity of GOBC as compared to GO as the contact angle of GOBC (77.75°) was higher than that of GO (53.98°). The effects of main column parameters such as bed height, initial analyte concentration and solution flow rate were investigated. The results revealed that shorter breakthrough time, and high adsorption capacity were obtained at high flow rates of 1 mL min-1, while longer breakthrough time and lower adsorption capacity were obtained at lower flow rates of 0.5 mL min-1. The effect of bed depth on the breakthrough curve of analyte adsorption was a steep breakthrough curve; or a shorter breakthrough time occurring at lower bed height. The adsorption data obeyed the Yoon-Nelson and Thomas models very well. The adsorption capacity for BPA, BPS, endosulphan, beta-estradiol, methylene blue and violate was found to be 307, 305, 260, 290, 230 and 195 mg g-1, respectively. The adsorption capacity of GOBC for toxic metal ions such as Pb2+, Li+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cr6+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, and As5+ was found to be 156, 136, 126, 124, 118, 114, 82, 82, 72 and 72 mg g-1, respectively with excellent kinetics. The adsorption data obtained using Jar-tests revealed that GOBC obeys a Langmuir isotherm and a pseudo second order kinetics model.

With increasing evidence of adverse effects, information on factors associated with exposure is necessary to form firm recommendations aiming at reducing exposure. Our aim was to identify associations between lifestyle factors including the home environment, use of personal care products (PCP), and dietary habits and concentrations of EDCs in ovarian follicular fluid. April-June 2016, 185 women undergoing ovum pick-up for in vitro fertilisation in Sweden were recruited. Correlation analyses were performed between self-reported lifestyle factors and concentration of EDCs analysed in follicular fluid. Habits related to cleaning, PCPs, and diet were assessed together with concentration of six per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) [PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA], methyl paraben and eight phthalate metabolites [MECPP, MEHPP, MEOHP, MEHP, cxMinCH, cxMiNP, ohMiNP, MEP, MOHiBP]. Spearman's partial correlations were adjusted for age, parity and BMI. Significant associations were discovered between multiple lifestyle factors and concentrations of EDCs in ovarian follicular fluid. After correcting p values for multiple testing, frequent use of perfume was associated with MEP (correlation ρ = 0.41 (confidence interval 0.21-0.47), p < 0.001); hens' egg consumption was positively associated with PFOS (ρ = 0.30 (0.15-0.43), p = 0.007) and PFUnDA (ρ = 0.27 (0.12-0.40), p = 0.036). White fish consumption was positively associated with PFUnDA (ρ = 0.34 (0.20-0.47), p < 0.001) and PFDA (ρ = 0.27 (0.13-0.41), p = 0.028). More correlations were discovered when considering the raw uncorrected p values. Altogether, our results suggest that multiple lifestyle variables affect chemical contamination of follicular fluid. This study shows how lifestyle factors correlate with the level of contamination in the ovary by both persistent and semi-persistent chemicals in women of reproductive age. Subsequently, these data can be used to form recommendations regarding lifestyle to mitigate possible negative health outcomes and fertility problems associated with chemical exposure, and to inform chemical policy decision making.

For example, each doubling of the concentration of antiandrogenic phthalate metabolites in urine was associated with a 1.94 point decrease (95% CI: 3.84, -0.05) in Math Computation scores, indicating poorer performance. For the most part, associations were stronger in adolescents with more, as compared to less, social disadvantage, but most of these differences did not achieve statistical significance.

Even low contents of bisphenols can exert adverse effects on human health and the ecological environment.

The mass spectrometric parameters of the seven bisphenols were optimized, and the response values, separation effects, and chromatographic peak shapes of the target compounds were compared under three different mobile phase conditions. The sediment samples were pretreated by accelerated solvent extraction, and orthogonal tests were used to optimize the extraction solvent, extraction temperature, and cycle number. The results showed that the use of 0.05% (v/v) ammonia and acetonitrile as the mobile phase for gradient elution could rapidly separate the seven bisphenols on an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm×2.1 mm, 1.7 μm).

Orthogonal experiments indicated that the optimal extraction conditions were as follows: extraction solvent of acetonitrile, extraction temperature of 100 ℃, and cycle number of three. The seven bisphenols showed good linearity in the range of 1.0-200 μg/L, with correlation coefficients (r2) greater than 0.999, and the limits of detection were 0.01-0.3 ng/g.

For example, BPA, BPS, and BPAF can alter the normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis by targeting kisspeptin neurons involved in steroid feedback signals to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cells, resulting in abnormal production of LH and FSH. Exposure to BPA, BPS, BPF, and BPB had adverse effects on the release of some hormones, namely 17-β-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), and testosterone (T). BPA, BPE, BPS, BPF, and BPAF are also capable of negatively altering the transcription of a number of genes involved in ovarian steroidogenesis, such as the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR, involved in the transfer of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the steroidogenesis process begins), cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp17a1, which is involved in the biosynthesis of androgens such as testosterone), 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme (3β-HSD, involved in the biosynthesis of P4), and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp19a1, involved in the biosynthesis of E2). Exposure to BPA, BPB, BPF, and BPS at prenatal or prepubertal stages could decrease the number of antral follicles by activating apoptosis and autophagy pathways, resulting in decreased production of E2 and P4 by granulosa cells (GCs) and theca cells (TCs), respectively. BPA and BPS impair ovarian steroidogenesis by reducing the function of some important cell receptors such as estrogens (ERs, including ERα and ERβ), progesterone (PgR), the orphan estrogen receptor gamma (ERRγ), the androgen receptor (AR), the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), the FSHR (follicle-stimulating hormone receptor), and the LHCGR (luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor). In animal models, the effects of bisphenol compounds depend on the type of animals, their age, and the duration and dose of bisphenols, while in cell line studies the duration and doses of bisphenols are the matter.",PMC10250808

Longitudinal cohort study in healthy Italian term newborn and their mothers from birth to the first 6 months of life. Urine samples were collected at respectively 0 (T0), 3 (T3), 6 (T6) months, and around the delivery for mothers. Urine samples were analyzed for a total of 7 major phthalate metabolites of 5 of the most commonly used phthalates. At six months of age a global child development assessment using the third edition of the Griffith Scales of Child Development (GSCD III) was performed in 104 participants. In a total of 387 urine samples, the seven metabolites analyzed appeared widespread and were detected in most of the urine samples collected at any time of sampling (66-100%). At six months most of the Developmental Quotients (DQs) falls in average range, except for the subscale B, which presents a DQ median score of 87 (85-95). Adjusted linear regressions between DQs and urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in mothers at T0 and in infants at T0, T3 and T6 identified several negative associations both for infants' and mothers especially for DEHP and MBzP. Moreover, once stratified by children's sex, negative associations were found in boys while positive in girls. Phthalates exposure is widespread, especially for not regulated compounds. Urinary phthalate metabolites were found to be associated to GSCD III scores, showing inverse association with higher phthalate levels related to lower development scores.

The association of fetal and childhood levels of phthalates with pubertal development were explored. We conduct a population-based birth cohort study to investigate the association between prenatal and childhood exposure to phthalates and pubertal development. Initially, a total of 445 children were recruited from 2000 to 2001, of which 90 children were followed for 15 years which measurements of urine and development assessed at 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 years. We defined higher Tanner stage as the 14-year-old Tanner stage ≥ 4 and 5 for boys and girls, respectively. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratio of a higher Tanner stage at 14 years old. The Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression were used to estimate the association of testicular volume, uterine volume, ovarian volume, and blood hormones at 14 years of age with the log-transformed concentration of phthalates at 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 years. In boys, a significantly different geometric mean of mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) was observed in 11-year-olds; 6.82 and 2.96 in the lower Tanner stage group and higher Tanner stage group. In girls, a significant difference in the geometric mean of mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) in 11-year-olds and mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) in 2-year-olds was observed; MEHHP was 32.97 and 18.13 in the lower Tanner stage group and higher Tanner stage group, and MEP was 26.54 and 65.74 in the lower Tanner stage group and higher Tanner stage group, respectively.

The decline in semen quality and testicular abnormalities have been attributed to the disruption of endocrine signaling as well as oxidative stress. The present study set out to examine the effect of short-term exposure of two common EDCs widely used in the plastic industry: Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP) and Bisphenol AF (BPAF). Our research objective was to focus on the post-testicular compartment of the epididymis, where spermatozoa acquire their functional capacity and are stored. The data obtained indicated no significant effect for either chemicals on sperm viability, motility or acrosome integrity. Neither of the EDCs had a noticeable effect on the structures of the testis and epididymis. However, substantial impact on the integrity of the sperm nucleus and DNA structure was evidenced by a significant increase in nuclear decondensation and DNA base oxidation. The damage observed was postulated to arise from the pro-oxidant properties of the EDCs generating excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggering a state of oxidative stress. This hypothesis was confirmed when the observed damage was largely blocked by co-administering EDCs with an evidenced-based antioxidant formulation.",PMC10215174

Growing evidence suggests that various EDCs may result in an impaired telomere structure and function, which is associated with male infertility. However, the adverse effect of DEHP on telomeres in male reproductive cells has rarely been studied, and the related mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we tested the effects of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the primary metabolite of DEHP, on telomere dysfunction in mouse spermatogonia-derived cells (GC-1) and the potential role of TERT and c-Myc in MEHP-induced spermatogenic cell damage. Results showed that MEHP induced cell viability inhibition, G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in GC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Shortened telomeres, reduced telomerase activity, and decreased expression of TERT, c-Myc, and upstream transcription factors of c-Myc were also observed in the MEHP-treated cells.

Human endometrial Ishikawa cells were exposed to low doses of BPS (1 nM and 100 nM) for 72 hours. Cell proliferation was assessed through the viability assays MTT and CellTiter-Glo®. Wound healing assays were also used to evaluate the migration potential of the cell line. The expression of genes related to proliferation and migration was also determined. Similarly, adult mice were exposed to BPS at a dose of 30 mg/kg body weight/day for 21 days, after which, the uterus was sent for histopathologic assessment. BPS increased cell number and stimulated migration in Ishikawa cells, in association with the upregulation of estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) and vimentin (VIM). In addition, mice exposed to BPS showed a significantly higher mean number of endometrial glands within the endometrium. Overall, in vitro and in vivo results obtained in this study showed that BPS could significantly promote endometrial epithelial cell proliferation and migration, a phenotype also observed with BPA exposure.

Moreover, the genotoxicity assay shows the ability of all tested compounds to increase in the β-galactosidase level at the concentration range 7.81-500 µM (in Escherichia coli, PQ37). In turn, the matbolic activation of tested bishpenols has caused the enhacement of the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity effect. Interestingely, the highest phytotoxicity effect was pointed for BPA and TBBPA at the concentrations of 10 mg ∙ L-1 and 50 mg ∙ L-1, which cause the inhibition of root growth by 58% and 45%, respectively (especially for S. alba and S. saccharatum). Furthermore, the cytotoxicity analyses show the ability of BPA, BPS, and TBBPA to significantly decrease the metabolic activity of human keratynoctes in vitro after 24 h of treatment at the micromolar concentrations.

37175656,Ahmad Besaratinia,The State of Research and Weight of Evidence on the Epigenetic Effects of Bisphenol A.,2023,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high-production-volume chemical with numerous industrial and consumer applications. BPA is extensively used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. The widespread utilities of BPA include its use as internal coating for food and beverage cans, bottles, and food-packaging materials, and as a building block for countless goods of common use. BPA can be released into the environment and enter the human body at any stage during its production, or in the process of manufacture, use, or disposal of materials made from this chemical. While the general population is predominantly exposed to BPA through contaminated food and drinking water, non-dietary exposures through the respiratory system, integumentary system, and vertical transmission, as well as other routes of exposure, also exist. BPA is often classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical as it can act as a xenoestrogen. Exposure to BPA has been associated with developmental, reproductive, cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, or immune effects, as well as oncogenic effects. BPA can disrupt the synthesis or clearance of hormones by binding and interfering with biological receptors. BPA can also interact with key transcription factors to modulate regulation of gene expression. Over the past 17 years, an epigenetic mechanism of action for BPA has emerged. This article summarizes the current state of research on the epigenetic effects of BPA by analyzing the findings from various studies in model systems and human populations. It evaluates the weight of evidence on the ability of BPA to alter the epigenome, while also discussing the direction of future research.",PMC10178030

Interestingly, global DNA hypomethylation was observed in placental DNA following exposure to DEHP at high concentrations. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed that DNA methylation affected genes related to neurological disorders, such as autism and dementia.

Despite being banned in 1979 due to human health concerns, they persist in the environment. In humans and experimental model systems, PCBs elicit toxicity in part by acting as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Aroclor 1221 (A1221) is a weakly estrogenic PCB mixture known to alter reproductive function in rodents. EDCs can impact hormone signaling at any level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, and we investigated the effects of A1221 exposure during the prenatal and postnatal developmental periods on pituitary hormone and steroid receptor expression in female rats. Examining offspring at 3 ages, postnatal day 8 (P8), P32 and P60, we found that prenatal exposure to A1221 increased P8 neonate pituitary luteinizing hormone beta (Lhb) mRNA and LHβ gonadotrope cell number while decreasing LH serum hormone concentration. No changes in pituitary hormone or hormone receptor gene expression were observed peri-puberty at P32. In reproductively mature rats at P60, we found pituitary follicle stimulating hormone beta (Fshb) mRNA levels increased by prenatal A1221 exposure with no corresponding alterations in FSH hormone or FSHβ expressing cell number. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) mRNA and protein levels were also increased at P60, but only following postnatal A1221 dosing.

Analyses were conducted among 254 pregnancies in the Human Placenta and Phthalates Study, a prospective cohort with recruitment 2017-2020. Exposures were geometric mean concentrations of phthalate and replacement biomarkers quantified in two spot urine samples collected around 12- and 14-weeks of gestation. Outcomes were fetal ultrasound biometry (head and abdominal circumferences, femur length, estimated fetal weight) collected in each trimester and converted to z-scores. Adjusted linear mixed effects (single-pollutant) and quantile g-computation (mixture) models with participant-specific random effects estimated the difference, on average, in longitudinal fetal growth for a one-interquartile range (IQR) increase in individual (single-pollutant) or all (mixture) early pregnancy phthalate and replacement biomarkers. Mono carboxyisononyl phthalate and the sums of metabolites of di-n-butyl, di-iso-butyl, and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate were inversely associated with fetal head and abdominal circumference z-scores.

This association was mainly driven by phthalate biomarkers. Urine concentrations of phthalate biomarkers, but not replacement biomarkers, in early pregnancy were associated with reductions in fetal growth.

For cross-sectional analyses, single spot urine samples were collected between 2017-2019 from a pilot sample of women (N = 91) of midlife age to estimate the urinary concentration of individual phthalates, phenols, and parabens and to calculate the summary concentration of phthalate mixtures. Seven-day nightly sleep duration, midpoint, and fragmentation were obtained from wrist-actigraphy devices and estimated from the actigraphy data using a pruned dynamic programming algorithm. Self-reported poor sleep quality was assessed by one item from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). We examined associations between urinary summary phthalate mixtures, phthalate metabolites, phenol, and paraben analytes with each sleep measure using linear or logistic (to compute odds of poor sleep quality only) regression models adjusted for specific gravity, age, and socioeconomic status.

The ability of these assays to accurately reflect chemical interactions in nonmammalian species remains uncertain. Therefore, a goal of the EDSP is to evaluate how broadly results can be extrapolated across taxa. To assess the cross-species conservation of AR-modulated pathways, computational analyses and systematic literature review approaches were used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing in silico, in vitro, and in vivo data. First, molecular target conservation was assessed across 585 diverse species based on the structural similarity of ARs. These results indicate that ARs are conserved across vertebrates and are predicted to share similarly susceptibility to chemicals that interact with the human AR. Systematic analysis of over 5000 published manuscripts was used to compile in vitro and in vivo cross-species toxicity data. Assessment of in vitro data indicates conservation of responses occurs across vertebrate ARs, with potential differences in sensitivity. Similarly, in vivo data indicate strong conservation of the AR signaling pathways across vertebrate species, although sensitivity may vary.

Furthermore, the levels of exposure to these endocrine disruptors in regular coffee consumers were estimated. Samples of packaged coffee powder/beans (n = 60) from different forms of packaging (multilayer bag, aluminum tin, and paper pod) and coffee beverages (n = 40) that were differently extracted (by professional espresso machine (PEM), Moka pot (MP), and home espresso machine (HEM)) were analyzed by extraction of the lipid fraction, purification, and determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Risk due to consumption of coffee (1-6 cups) was assessed based on tolerable daily intake (TDI) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). No significant differences emerged in DBP and DEHP concentrations among different types of packaging (multilayer, aluminum, and paper), whereas higher levels of DEHP were reported in beverages extracted by PEM (6.65, 2.58-11.32) than by MP (0.78, 0.59-0.91) and HEM (0.83, 0.62-0.98). The presence of higher DEHP levels in coffee beverages than in coffee powder may be due to its leaching through machine components. However, the levels of PAEs did not exceed the specific migration limits (SMLs) set out for food contact materials (FCM), and exposure to PAEs from coffee beverages was low, justifying the small risk due of its consumption.

At the same time, a BPA exposure group without feed additives (BPA group) and a blank group with neither BPA exposure nor feed additives (Con group) were setted. The liver morphology, hepatosomatic index (HSI), hepatic lipid deposition, TG level, and expression of lipid metabolism-related genes were analyzed after 5 weeks of feeding. The HSI in bile acid and allicin groups was significantly lower than that in Con group. The TG in resveratrol, bile acid, allicin, and inositol groups returned to Con level. Principal component analysis of TG synthesis, decomposition, and transport related genes showed that dietary bile acid and inositol supplementation had the best effect on the recovery of BPA-induced lipid metabolism disorder, followed by allicin and resveratrol. In terms of lipid metabolism-related enzyme activity, bile acid and inositol were the most effective in recovering BPA-induced lipid metabolism disorders. The addition of these additives had a restorative effect on the antioxidant capacity of G. rarus livers, but bile acids and inositol were relatively the most effective. The results of the present study demonstrated that under the present dosage, bile acids and inositol had the best improvement effect on the fatty liver of G. rarus caused by BPA. The present study will provide important reference for solving the problem of fatty liver caused by environmental estrogen in aquaculture.",PMC9973200

As a typical class of endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs), PAEs posed adverse effects on aquatic organisms at low concentration. Thus, they have attracted wide attention in recent years. In the present study, the concentrations of seven typical PAEs from 30 sampling sites in Baiyangdian Lake were measured, and the environmental exposure data of PAEs were gathered in typical rivers in China. Then, based on the aquatic life criteria (ALCs) derived from the reproductive toxicity data of aquatic organisms, two risk assessment methods, including hazard quotient (HQ) and probabilistic ecological risk assessment (PERA), were adopted to evaluate the ecological risks of PAEs in water. The sediment quality criteria (SQCs) of DEHP, DBP, BBP, DIBP and DEP were deduced based on the equilibrium partitioning method. Combined with the gathered environmental exposure data of seven PAEs in sediments from typical rivers in China, the ecological risk assessments of five PAEs in sediment were conducted only by the HQ method. The results of ecological risk assessment showed that in terms of water, DBP and DIBP posed low risk, while the risk of DEHP in Baiyangdian Lake cannot be ignored and should receive attention. In typical rivers in China, BBP and DEP posed no risk, while DIBP and DBP posed potential risk. Meanwhile, DEHP posed a high ecological risk. As far as sediment is concerned, DBP posed a high risk in some typical rivers in China, and the other rivers had medium risk. DEHP posed a high risk only in a few rivers and low to medium risk in others. This study provides an important reference for the protection of aquatic organisms and the risk management of PAEs in China.",PMC9962510

Testicular lipids contain high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids necessary for sperm maturity, motility, and spermatogenesis. Whether prenatal exposure to bisphenols alters testicular fatty acid metabolism in adult offspring is unknown. Pregnant Wistar rats were gavaged from gestational day 4 to 21 with BPA and BPS (0.0, 0.4, 4.0, 40.0 μg/kg bw/day). Despite increased body and testis weight, the total testicular cholesterol, triglyceride, and plasma fatty acids were unaffected in the offspring. Lipogenesis was upregulated by increased SCD-1, SCD-2, and expression of lipid storage (ADRP) and trafficking protein (FABP4). The arachidonic acid, 20:4 n-6 (ARA) and docosapentaenoic acid, 22:5 n-6 (DPA) levels were decreased in the BPA-exposed testis, while BPS exposure had no effects. The expression of PPARα, PPARγ proteins, and CATSPER2 mRNA were decreased, which are important for energy dissipation and the motility of the sperm in the testis. The endogenous conversion of linoleic acid,18:2 n-6 (LA), to ARA was impaired by a reduced ARA/LA ratio and decreased FADS1 expression in BPA-exposed testis. Collectively, fetal BPA exposure affected endogenous long-chain fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenesis in the adult testis, which might dysregulate sperm maturation and quality.",PMC9958878

Our recent studies have shown that prenatal BPA exposure disrupted ASD-related gene expression in the hippocampus, neurological functions, and behaviors associated with ASD in a sex-specific pattern. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of BPA are still unclear. Transcriptome data mining and molecular docking analyses were performed to identify ASD-related transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes underlying the sex-specific effects of prenatal BPA exposure. Gene ontology analysis was conducted to predict biological functions associated with these genes. The expression levels of ASD-related TFs and targets in the hippocampus of rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA were measured using qRT-PCR analysis. The role of the androgen receptor (AR) in BPA-mediated regulation of ASD candidate genes was investigated using a human neuronal cell line stably transfected with AR-expression or control plasmid. Synaptogenesis, which is a function associated with genes transcriptionally regulated by ASD-related TFs, was assessed using primary hippocampal neurons isolated from male and female rat pups prenatally exposed to BPA. We found that there was a sex difference in ASD-related TFs underlying the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on the transcriptome profiles of the offspring hippocampus. In addition to the known BPA targets AR and ESR1, BPA could directly interact with novel targets (i.e., KDM5B, SMAD4, and TCF7L2). The targets of these TFs were also associated with ASD. Prenatal BPA exposure disrupted the expression of ASD-related TFs and targets in the offspring hippocampus in a sex-dependent manner. Moreover, AR was involved in the BPA-mediated dysregulation of AUTS2, KMT2C, and SMARCC2. Prenatal BPA exposure altered synaptogenesis by increasing synaptic protein levels in males but not in females, but the number of excitatory synapses was increased in female primary neurons only. Our findings suggest that AR and other ASD-related TFs are involved in sex differences in the effects of prenatal BPA exposure on transcriptome profiles and synaptogenesis in the offspring hippocampus. These TFs may play an essential role in an increased ASD susceptibility associated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals, particularly BPA, and the male bias of ASD.",PMC9940328

Further, an association between BPA and circulating vitamin D (VitD) levels were documented. The role of VitD in BPA-induced liver pathological changes was explored in this study. Healthy 4.5-week-old male (n = 35) and female (n = 35) Swiss albino mice were used in this study. The animals were randomly divided into control and treated groups. The control groups were further divided into sham (no treatment) and vehicle (corn oil), whereas the treated groups were also divided into VitD (2195 U/kg), BPA (50 μg/kg), and BPA + VitD (50 μg/kg + 2195 U/kg) groups. For 6 weeks (twice a week), the animals were dosed intraperitoneally. One week later (at 10.5-weeks-old), the animals were sacrificed for biochemical and histological analyses. BPA produced a considerable rise in the body and liver weights in both genders of mice when compared to control mice. BPA also caused significant increases in the liver damage markers alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). It also induced liver histopathological changes, including higher apoptotic indices in both genders. On the other hand, treatment with VitD considerably reduced liver damage and slightly decreased the apoptotic index rate. The ALP, ALT, and GGT levels were also markedly reduced. VitD has been proven to have a protective effect on both genders. According to our findings, VitD protects mice from BPA-induced liver damage, possibly via suppressing liver damage markers.",PMC9897508

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals is correlated with increased diabetes incidence. We hypothesized that treatment with bisphenol A (BPA) induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), leading to impaired function of the β-cells, which over time, can cause diabetes. In this study, we aimed to evaluate UPR pathways activation under BPA treatment in β-cells and possible recovery of ER homeostasis. MIN6 cells (mouse insulinoma cell line) and isolated pancreatic islets from NOR (non-obese diabetes resistant) mice were treated with BPA. We analyzed the impact of BPA on β-cell viability, the architecture of the early secretory pathway, the synthesis and processing of insulin and the activation of UPR sensors and effectors. We found that the addition of the chemical chaperone TUDCA rescues the deleterious effects of BPA, resulting in improved viability, morphology and function of the β-cells.

These substances may penetrate the environment and living organisms, on which they have a negative impact. Till now, numerous studies have described parabens and BPA in humans, but knowledge about terrestrial wild mammals' exposure to these compounds is very limited. Therefore, during this study, the most common concentration levels of BPA and parabens were selected (such as methyl paraben-MeP, ethyl paraben-EtP, propyl paraben-PrP and butyl paraben-BuP) and analyzed in guano samples collected in summer (nursery) colonies of greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) using liquid chromatography with the tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method. MeP has been found in all guano samples and its median concentration levels amounted to 39.6 ng/g. Other parabens were present in smaller number of samples (from 5% for BuP to 62.5% for EtP) and in lower concentrations. Median concentration levels of these substances achieved 0.95 ng/g, 1.45 ng/g and 15.56 ng/g for EtP, PrP and BuP, respectively. BPA concentration levels did not exceed the method quantification limit (5 ng/g dw) in any sample.

A better definition of environmental risks is critical to understand both etiology and the sex-related differences of MS. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) fully represents one of these risks. EDCs are natural or synthetic exogenous substances (or mixtures) that alter the functions of the endocrine system. Among synthetic EDCs, exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been implicated in the etiology of MS, but to date, controversial data has emerged. Furthermore, nothing is known about bisphenol S (BPS), one of the most widely used substitutes for BPA. As exposure to bisphenols will not disappear soon, it is necessary to clarify their role also in this pathological condition defining their role in disease onset and course in both sexes. In this study, we examined, in both sexes, the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA and BPS in one of the most widely used mouse models of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Exposure to bisphenols seemed to be particularly deleterious in males. In fact, both BPA- and BPS-treated males showed anticipation of the disease onset and an increased motoneuron loss in the spinal cord. Overall, BPA-treated males also displayed an exacerbation of EAE course and an increase in inflammation markers in the spinal cord. Analyzing the consequences of bisphenol exposure on EAE will help to better understand the role of both xenoestrogens and endogenous estrogens on the sexually dimorphic characteristics of MS.",PMC10172280

GC are sensitive to endocrine disruptors, including bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogue bisphenol S (BPS), plasticisers present in everyday consumer products. BPA exhibits greater binding affinity for the membrane oestrogen receptor (GPER) than for the nuclear oestrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ). Here, we analysed the effects of BPA and BPS on the steroidogenesis of ovine GC in vitro, as well as their early mechanisms of action, the ovine being a relevant model to study human reproductive impairment. Disruption of GC steroidogenesis might alter oocyte quality and consequently fertility rate. In addition, we compared the effects of a specific GPER agonist (G-1) and antagonist (G-15) to those of BPA and BPS. Ewe GC were cultured with BPA or BPS (10 or 50 µM) or G-1 (1 µM) and/or G-15 (10 µM) for 48 h to study steroidogenesis. Both BPA and BPS (10 µM) altered the secretion of progesterone, however, only BPS (10 µM) affected oestradiol secretion. RNA-seq was performed on GC after 1 h of culture with BPA or BPS (50 µM) or G-1 (10 µM), followed by real-time PCR analyses of differentially expressed genes after 12, 24 and 48 h of culture. The absence of induced GPER target genes showed that BPA and BPS did not activate GPER in GC after 1 h of treatment. These molecules exhibited mainly independent early mechanisms of action. Gene ontology analysis showed that after 1 h of treatment, BPA mainly disrupted the expression of the genes involved in metabolism and transcription, while BPS had a smaller effect and impaired cellular communications. BPA had a transient effect on the expression of CHAC1 (NOTCH signalling and oxidative balance), JUN (linked to MAPK pathway), NR4A1 (oestradiol secretion inhibition), ARRDC4 (endocytose of GPCR) and KLF10 (cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis), while expression changes were maintained over time for the genes LSMEM1 (linked to MAPK pathway), TXNIP (oxidative stress) and LIF (cell cycle regulation) after 12 and 48 h, respectively.

Ovarian follicles undergoing folliculogenesis (indirectly measured by ovarian volume) produce anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and estradiol (E2). We evaluated associations of phthalates with ovarian volume to assess whether this explained prior positive associations of phthalates with AMH and E2. Women ages 45-54 years (n = 614) had transvaginal ultrasounds of right/left ovaries to calculate mean ovarian volume. Women provided up-to-four urine and blood samples for quantifying AMH (first serum sample), E2 (all serum samples), and nine phthalate metabolites (from pooled urine, representing six parent phthalates). Multivariable linear or logistic regression models (for individual phthalate biomarkers), as well as weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression (for mixture analyses) evaluated associations of phthalate biomarkers with ovarian volume. Using cross-sectional mediation analysis, we assessed whether associations of phthalates with ovarian volume partially explained those of phthalates with AMH or E2. Most women were non-Hispanic White (68%) and pre-menopausal (67%) with higher urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations than U.S. women. In single-pollutant models, 10% increases in mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) and monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) were associated with 0.44% (95% CI: -0.02%, 0.91%) and 0.62% (95% CI: 0.02%, 1.23%) larger ovarian volumes, respectively.

DEHP exposure was associated with altered hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis function. Although previous studies reported deleterious effects of DEHP exposure during the intrauterine period, few studies have evaluated the direct effects triggered by this endocrine disruptor on the offspring animals' thyroid function. This study aimed to investigate the impact of intrauterine exposure to DEHP on the HPT axis function programming of the offspring animals during adulthood. Pregnant Wistar rats were orally treated with corn oil or corn oil supplemented with DEHP (0.48 or 4.8 mg/kg/day) throughout the gestational period. The offspring rats were euthanized on the 90th postnatal day. Hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, and liver were collected to analyze gene expression and protein content through qPCR and Western Blot. Blood was collected to determine TSH and thyroid hormone levels through fluorometric or chemiluminescence immunoassays. In the adult F1 female rats, the highest dose of DEHP decreased TSH serum levels. In the thyroid, DEHP reduced the gene expression and/or protein content of NIS, TSHR, TG, TPO, MCT8, NKX2.1, PAX8, and FOXE1. These data are consistent with the reduction in T4 serum levels of the F1 DEHP-exposed female rats. In the liver, DEHP exposure increased the mRNA expression of Dio1 and Ttr, while the highest dose of DEHP reduced the mRNA expression of Ugt1a1 and Ugt1a6. Conversely, in the F1 male adult rats, TSHB expression and TSH serum levels were increased in DEHP-exposed animals. In the thyroid, except for the reduced protein content of TSHR, none of the evaluated genes/proteins were altered by DEHP. TH serum levels were not changed in the DEHP-exposed F1 male rats compared to the control group. Additionally, there were no significant alterations in the expression of hepatic enzymes in these animals. Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that intrauterine exposure to DEHP disrupts the HPT axis function in male and female offspring rats and strongly suggest that DEHP exposure increases the susceptibility of the offspring animals to develop thyroid dysfunctions during adulthood.",PMC9880230

We recently demonstrated that several widely used plastic-associated EDCs increase cardiometabolic disease in appropriate mouse models. In addition to affecting adult health, parental exposure to EDCs has also been shown to cause metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes, in the offspring. While most studies have focused on the impact of maternal EDC exposure on the offspring's health, little is known about the effects of paternal EDC exposure. In the current study, we investigated the adverse impact of paternal exposure to a ubiquitous but understudied phthalate, dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) on the metabolic health of F1 and F2 offspring in mice. Paternal DCHP exposure led to exacerbated insulin resistance and impaired insulin signaling in F1 offspring without affecting diet-induced obesity. We previously showed that sperm small non-coding RNAs including tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs) contribute to the intergenerational transmission of paternally acquired metabolic disorders. Using a novel PANDORA-seq, we revealed that DCHP exposure can lead to sperm tsRNA/rsRNA landscape changes that were undetected by traditional RNA-seq, which may contribute to DCHP-elicited adverse effects. Lastly, we found that paternal DCHP can also cause sex-specific transgenerational adverse effects in F2 offspring and elicited glucose intolerance in female F2 descendants. Our results suggest that exposure to endocrine disrupting phthalates may have intergenerational and transgenerational adverse effects on the metabolic health of their offspring.

FOXA3 protein levels were decreased in testicular interstitium at a dose previously found to reduce testosterone levels, suggesting a primary effect of fetal exposure to Gen + DEHP on adult Leydig cells, rather than on spermatids and Sertoli cells, also expressing FOXA3.

The impact of BPS on some populations of neurons was stronger than that noted under the influence of BPA. The obtained results clearly show that BPS (similarly to BPA) administered for long time is not neutral for the enteric neurons even in relatively low doses and may be more potent than BPA for certain neuronal populations.",PMC9824883

There is mounting evidence linking exposure to MDCs to increased susceptibility to diabetes. Despite the important role of glucagon in glucose homeostasis, there is little information on the effects of MDCs on α-cells. Furthermore, there are no methods to identify and test MDCs with the potential to alter α-cell viability and function. Here, we used the mouse α-cell line αTC1-9 to evaluate the effects of MDCs on cell viability and glucagon secretion. We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 µM): bisphenol-A (BPA), tributyltin (TBT), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), triphenylphosphate (TPP), triclosan (TCS), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). Using two different approaches, MTT assay and DNA-binding dyes, we observed that BPA and TBT decreased α-cell viability via a mechanism that depends on the activation of estrogen receptors and PPARγ, respectively. These two chemicals induced ROS production, but barely altered the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. Although PFOA, TPP, TCS, and DDE did not alter cell viability nor induced ROS generation or ER stress, all four compounds negatively affected glucagon secretion. Our findings suggest that αTC1-9 cells seem to be an appropriate model to test chemicals with metabolism-disrupting activity and that the improvement of the test methods proposed herein could be incorporated into protocols for the screening of diabetogenic MDCs.",PMC9820113

We aimed to advance novel methods to investigate exposures to complex chemical mixtures. Silicone wristbands were worn by 243 office workers in the USA, UK, China, and India during four work shifts. We analyzed extracts of the wristbands for: 1) 99 known (targeted) chemicals; 2) 1000+ unknown chemical features, tentatively identified through suspect screening; and 3) total hormonal activities towards estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and thyroid hormone (TR) receptors in human cell assays. We evaluated associations of chemicals with hormonal activities using Bayesian kernel machine regression models, separately for targeted versus suspect chemicals (with detection ≥50%). Every wristband exhibited hormonal activity towards at least one receptor: 99% antagonized TR, 96% antagonized AR, and 58% agonized ER. Compared to men, women were exposed to mixtures that were more estrogenic (180% higher, adjusted for country, age, and skin oil abundance in wristband), anti-androgenic (110% higher), and complex (median 836 detected chemical features versus 780). Adjusted models showed strong associations of jointly increasing chemical concentrations with higher hormonal activities. Several targeted and suspect chemicals were important co-drivers of overall mixture effects, including chemicals used as plasticizers, fragrance, sunscreen, pesticides, and from other or unknown sources. This study highlights the role of personal care products and building microenvironments in hormone-disrupting exposures, and the substantial contribution of chemicals not often identifiable or well-understood to those exposures.",PMC9937064

We studied 830 children ages 6-10 years in 2007-2010 in a Boston-area cohort. We quantified urinary metabolites and summed their concentrations to calculate biomarkers of the concentrations of ten parent phthalates/replacements. We used linear regression to examine mutually adjusted associations of each predictor with each phthalate biomarker. We used logistic regression to examine predictors of 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, diisononyl ester (DINCH) biomarker detectability. Predictor characteristics explained 25-48% of urinary biomarker variability. Di-2-ethylhexyl terephthalate (DEHTP) biomarker was higher in females (18.7% [95% CI: 0.7, 39.9]), children who consumed more meat and dairy, and samples collected from later years.

Among them, phthalate esters are recognized as endocrine disruptors that target male reproductive functions. With this notion, past studies designed and produced alternative plasticizers that could replace phthalates with limited toxicity to the environment and to male reproductive functions. Here, we focused on one reproductive cell type that was not investigated in past studies-spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs)-and examined in vitro the effects on 22 compounds (seven plasticizers currently in use and 15 newly synthesized potential alternative plasticizers) for their effects on SSCs. Our in vitro compound screening analyses showed that a majority of the compounds examined had a limited level of toxicity to SSCs. Yet, some commercial plasticizers and their derivatives, such as DEHP (di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) and MEHP (mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate), were detrimental at 10-5 to 10-4 M. Among new compounds, some of maleate- and fumarate-derivatives showed toxic effects. In contrast, no detrimental effects were detected with two new compounds, BDDB (1,4 butanediol dibenzoate) and DOS (dioctyl succinate). Furthermore, SSCs that were exposed to BDDB and DOS in vitro successfully established spermatogenic colonies in testes of recipient mice after transplantation. These results demonstrate that SSC culture acts as an effective platform for toxicological tests on SSC function and provide novel information that two new compounds, BDDB and DOS, are alternative plasticizers that do not have significant negative impacts on SSC integrity.",PMC9776359

Considering its adverse effects, BPA has been banned or strictly restricted in some nations, and many analogs have been introduced to the market. In this study, we selected three representative substitutes, BPS, BPF, and BPAF, along with BPA, to assess the developmental and reproductive effects on Daphnia magna. The F0 generation was exposed to bisphenols (BPs) at an environmentally relevant concentration (100 μg/L) for 21 d; then the embryo spawn at day 21 was collected. Behavior traits, the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and gene transcription were evaluated at three developmental stages (days 7, 14, and 21). Notably, body length, heart rate, and thoracic limb beating were significantly decreased, and D. magna behaved more sluggishly in the exposed group. Moreover, exposure to BPs significantly increased the antioxidant enzymatic activities, which indicated that BPs activated the antioxidant defense system. Additionally, gene expression indicated intergenerational effects in larvae, particularly in the BPAF group. In conclusion, BPA analogs such as BPF and BPAF showed similar or stronger reproductive and developmental toxicity than BPA in D. magna.

We examined associations between summary phthalates, individual phthalate metabolites, and phenol and paraben analytes with mean weekday sleep duration, midpoint, and fragmentation using linear regression models adjusted for specific-gravity and sex, age, pubertal status, smoking and alcohol behavior, physical activity, and screen time. Mean (SD) age was 13.8 (2.1) years; 53.5 % were female.

Here we examine changes in the rate of postnatal apoptosis in the rat prefrontal cortex and its timing with brief BPA exposure. Because an increased number of neurons in the PFC is a characteristic of a subtype of autism spectrum disorder, we tested social preference following brief BPA exposure and also expression of a small group of genes. Males and females were exposed to BPA from postnatal days (P) 6 through 8 or from P10 through 12. Both exposures significantly decreased indicators of cell death in the developing medial prefrontal cortex in male subjects only. Additionally, males exposed to BPA from P6 - 8 showed decreased social preference and decreased cortical expression of Shank3 and Homer1, two synaptic scaffolding genes that have been implicated in social deficits.

For this purpose, a novel HepARE-Luc cell line that stably expresses human androgen receptor (AR) and the androgen responsive luciferase reporter gene was generated and used in the present study. Treatment of this cell line with androgens and corresponding antiandrogen (flutamide) stimulated or inhibited expression of reporter luciferase, respectively. Real time polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining results exhibited transcription response and translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in response to androgen. Observations implied that a cell-based xenobiotic screening assay via AR response can be conducted for assessing the (anti)androgenic ligands present in food chain including milk. Therefore, the cell line was further used to screen the (anti)androgenic activity of a total of 40 milk fat samples procured as raw or commercial milk. Some of the raw and commercial milk fat samples distinctly showed antiandrogenic activities. Subsequently, some commonly used environmental chemicals were also evaluated for their (anti)androgenic activities. Initial observations with molecular docking studies of experimental compounds were performed to assess their interaction with AR ligand binding domain. Furthermore, (anti)androgenic activities of these compounds were confirmed by performing luciferase assay using the HepARE-Luc cell line. None of the test compounds showed androgenic activities rather some of them like Bisphenol A (BPA) and rifamycin showed antiandrogenic activities.

Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), such as bisphenol A (BPA), are environmental toxicants that are known to negatively impact reproductive functions. As such, the use of BPA in the manufacturing industry has slowly been replaced by analogs, including bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF), despite limited knowledge available regarding their impact on health and their safety. The following study investigates the effects of BPA, BPS and BPF at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL on bovine granulosa cell apoptosis, with the ultimate goal of determining how they may impact oocyte competence and, thus, overall fertility. The underlying hypothesis is that bisphenols disrupt the granulosa cell environment surrounding the oocyte inducing excessive apoptosis via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. To test this hypothesis, apoptosis was measured following a time- and dose-dependent exposure to all three bisphenols by flowcytometry paired with annexin V/PI staining as well as by quantification of key genes belonging to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway both at the mRNA and protein levels. The results of this study report that BPA and BPF reduce cell viability through reduced cell counts and increased apoptosis. This increase is due, in part, to the induction of apoptotic genes of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Additionally, this study also suggests that BPS may not act on the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in bovine granulosa cells. Overall, this study allows us to establish potential apoptotic pathways activated by bisphenols as well as compare the relative apoptotic activities of BPA to its most widespread analogs.",PMC9650025

The poly (dibenzo-18-crown-6-ether)/polystyrene composite nanofibers (PDB18C6/PS) were prepared by electrospinning and used as an adsorbent for the on-line PFSPE column. The on-line PFSPE-HPLC equipment contained a dual ternary pump and a switching valve to enable enrichment, purification, and analysis directly in the system. The results showed that the proposed on-line PFSPE-HPLC-FLD method realized the simultaneous separation and detection of eight BPs: BPF, BPE, BPA, BPB, BPAF, BPAP, BPC and BPZ. The curves of the target analytes were prepared with good correlation coefficient values (r2 > 0.998) in the range of 50−1000 pg/mL. The limit of detection (S/N = 3) was 20 pg/mL, the limit of quantitation (S/N = 10) is 50 pg/mL. The recoveries of eight BPs were 94.8−127.3%, and the intra-day precisions (RSD) were less than 10%.

The biochemical results showed that a marked significant reduction (p < 0.05) was produced in the levels of serum glucose, hypoproteinaemia and hypoalbuminemia in the groups exposed to the highest doses, whereas in the group exposed to 50 µg/kg BW/day the glucose and total protein levels dropped, and the animals exposed to 100 µg/kg BW/day experienced a diminution in albumin levels. In the case of the group exposed to 50 µg/kg BW/day, however, hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia were determined, and the blood parameters indicating kidney alterations such as urea and creatinine experienced a significant increase (p < 0.05) with respect to the controls. Regarding the pituitary and gonads, none of the animals exposed presented histological alterations at the doses tested, giving similar images to those of the control group. These results suggest that continuous exposure to low BPA doses could trigger an inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, which would result in a hypoglycaemic state, together with an induction of the enzymes responsible for lipidic synthesis, a mechanism by which the increase in the lipid and serum cholesterol levels could be explained. Likewise, the decline in the protein and albumin levels would be indicative of a possible hepatic alteration, and the increase in urea and creatinine would point to a possible renal perturbation, derived from continuous exposure to this xenobiotic. Based on our results, it could be said that chronic exposure to low BPA doses would not produce any clinical signs or histological pituitary-gonadal effects, but it could cause modifications in some blood biochemical parameters, that could initially indicate a possible hepatic and renal effect.",PMC9659152

EDCs are known as an emerging contaminant, and if these pollutants are not properly removed, they can enter the water cycle and reach the water supply for residential use, causing harm to human health. Reverse osmosis (RO) has been known as a promising technology to remove EDCs. However, there is a lack of consensus on their performance, especially on the feed concentrations of EDC that vary from one source to another. In this study, polyamide thin-film composite (PA TFC) membrane was incorporated with one-dimensional titania nanotube (TNT) to mitigate trade-off between water permeability and solute rejection of EDC. The characterization indicated that the membrane surface hydrophilicity has been greatly increased with the presence of TNT. Using bisphenol A (BPA) and caffeine as model EDC, the removal efficiencies of the pristine TFC and thin-film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes were evaluated. Compared to TFC membrane, the membrane modified with 0.01% of TNT exhibited improved permeability of 50% and 49% for BPA and caffeine, respectively. A satisfactory BPA rejection of 89.05% and a caffeine rejection of 97.89% were achieved by the TNT incorporated TFN membranes. Furthermore, the greater hydrophilicity and smoother surface of 0.01 TFN membrane led to lower membrane fouling tendency under long-term filtration.",PMC9609337

However, to date, studies have focused little on the perturbations of prostate health initiated by the BPA derivative bisphenol AF (BPAF) and co-exposure to bisphenol compounds. An in vivo study orally administrated male rats with BPA (10, 90 μg/kg), BPAF (10, 90 μg/kg) and the inhibitor of nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB), pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC, 100 mg/kg). Based on the anatomical analysis, pathological observations and PCNA over-expression, we considered that low-dose BPA and BPAF facilitated ventral prostatic hyperplasia in rats. The results of IHC and ELISA mirrored the regulation of NF-κB p65, COX-2, TNF-α and EGFR in BPA- and BPAF-induced prostatic toxicity. An in vitro study found that the additive effect of combined exposure to BPA (10 nM) and BPAF (10 nM) could cause an elevation in the proliferation of and a reduction in the apoptosis level of human prostate stromal cells (WPMY-1) and fibroblasts (HPrF). Meanwhile, the underlying biomarkers of the NF-κB signaling pathway also involved the abnormal proliferative progression of prostate cells. The findings recapitulated the induction of BPAF exposure and co-treatment with BPA and BPAF on prostatic hyperplasia and emphasized the modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.",PMC9602908

In humans, exposure to brominated flame retardants (BFR) or other environmentally persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and novel organophosphate flame retardants has been associated with increasing trends of diabetes and metabolic disease. However, the effects of PBDEs on metabolic processes and their associated sex-dependent features are poorly understood. The metabolic-disrupting effects of perinatal exposure to industrial penta-PBDE mixture, DE-71, on male and female progeny of C57BL/6N mouse dams were examined in adulthood. Dams were exposed to environmentally relevant doses of PBDEs daily for 10 weeks (p.o.): 0.1 (L-DE-71) and 0.4 mg/kg/d (H-DE-71) and offspring parameters were compared to corn oil vehicle controls (VEH/CON). The following lipid metabolism indices were measured: plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, adiponectin, leptin, and liver lipids. L-DE-71 female offspring were particularly affected, showing hypercholesterolemia, elevated liver lipids and fasting plasma leptin as compared to same-sex VEH/CON, while L- and H-DE-71 male F1 only showed reduced plasma adiponectin. Using the quantitative Folch method, we found that mean liver lipid content was significantly elevated in L-DE-71 female offspring compared to controls. Oil Red O staining revealed fatty liver in female offspring and dams. General measures of adiposity, body weight, white and brown adipose tissue (BAT), and lean and fat mass were weighed or measured using EchoMRI. DE-71 did not produce abnormal adiposity, but decreased BAT depots in L-DE-71 females and males relative to same-sex VEH/CON. To begin to address potential central mechanisms of deregulated lipid metabolism, we used RT-qPCR to quantitate expression of hypothalamic genes in energy-regulating circuits that control lipid homeostasis. Both doses of DE-71 sex-dependently downregulated hypothalamic expression of Lepr, Stat3, Mc4r, Agrp, Gshr in female offspring while H-DE-71 downregulated Npy in exposed females relative to VEH/CON. In contrast, exposed male offspring displayed upregulated Stat3 and Mc4r. Intestinal barrier integrity was measured using FITC-dextran since it can lead to systemic inflammation that leads to liver damage and metabolic disease, but was not affected by DE-71 exposure. These findings indicate that maternal transfer of PBDEs disproportionately endangers female offspring to lipid metabolic reprogramming that may exaggerate risk for adult metabolic disease.",PMC9580103

Herein, the magnetic Fe3O4-Au@Ag@(Au@Ag) nanocomposites (CSSN NCs) have been prepared by self-assembly method and applied for ultra-sensitive surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) detection of BPA. A simple and rapid coupling reaction of Pauly's reagents and BPA not only solved the problem of poor affinity between BPA and noble metals, but also provided the SERRS activity of BPA azo products. The distribution of hot spots and the influence of incremental introduction of noble metals on the performance of SERRS were analyzed by a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. The abundance of hot spots generated by core-shell-satellite structure and outstanding SERRS performance of Au@Ag nanocrystals were responsible for excellent SERRS sensitivity of CSSN NCs in the results. The limit of detection (LOD) of CSSN NCs for BPA azo products was as low as 10-10 M. In addition, the saturation magnetization (Ms) value of CSSN NCs was 53.6 emu·g-1, which could be rapidly enriched and collected under the condition of external magnetic field. These magnetic core-shell-satellite NCs provide inspiration idea for the tailored design of ultra-sensitive SERRS substrates, and thus exhibit limitless application prospects in terms of pollutant detection, environmental monitoring, and food safety.",PMC9565892

Primary EnSC and EnEC, isolated from six fertile egg donors, and Ishikawa cells were exposed to DEHP (0.1, 1, and 10 µM) and were assessed for viability, endometriosis markers (IL-6, VEGF-A, HOXA10, EZH2, and LSD1), steroid receptor gene expressions (ER-1, ER-2, PR-T, PR-B, and PGRMC1), and invasive capacity. Viability after 72 h of DEHP exposure was not significantly affected. None of the endometriosis markers studied were altered after acute DEHP exposure, nor was the expression of steroid receptors. The invasive capacity of EnSC was significantly increased after 10 µM of DEHP exposure. In conclusion, acute DEHP exposure in primary endometrial cells does not fully phenocopy the changes in the viability, expression of markers, or steroidal receptors described in endometriosis. However, the significant increase in EnSC invasiveness observed after DEHP exposure could be a link between DEHP exposure and increased endometriosis likelihood.",PMC9569573

However, data during pregnancy are scant. We investigated the prospective associations between pregnancy phenol concentrations and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) risk. In a nested matched case-control study of 111 individuals with GDM and 222 individuals without GDM within the prospective PETALS cohort, urinary bisphenol A (BPA), BPA substitutes (bisphenol F and bisphenol S [BPS]), benzophenone-3, and triclosan were quantified during the first and second trimesters. Cumulative concentrations across the two times were calculated using the area under the curve (AUC). Multivariable conditional logistic regression examined the association of individual phenols with GDM risk. We conducted mixture analysis using Bayesian kernel machine regression. We a priori examined effect modification by Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI) race/ethnicity resulting from the case-control matching and highest GDM prevalence among A/PIs. Overall, first-trimester urinary BPS was positively associated with increased risk of GDM (adjusted odds ratio comparing highest vs. lowest tertile [aORT3 vs. T1] 2.12 [95% CI 1.00-4.50]). We identified associations among non-A/Ps, who had higher phenol concentrations than A/PIs.

These effects were also observed at the behavioural level. To shed more light on these findings, in this new study we compared testicular tissue morphology between control and phthalatetreated males and investigated possible persistent changes and sex differences in the expression of two hippocampal microRNAs - miR- 15b-5p and miR-34a-5p - participating in the transcription of steroidogenic genes. Histologically observed changes in testicular tissue morphology of phthalate-exposed males compared to control support testosterone drop observed in the previous study.

We calculated pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestational age-specific GWG z-scores (GWGz). We quantified 19 phthalate/replacement metabolites (representing 10 parent compounds) in pools of up-to-five first-morning urine samples, collected approximately monthly between 8 and 40 weeks gestation.

Our aim was to evaluate the association of urinary and placental tissue phthalates, and to explore the role of maternal and pregnancy characteristics that may bias estimates. Fifty pregnancies were selected from the CANDLE Study, recruited from 2006 to 2011 in Tennessee. Linear models were used to estimate associations of urinary phthalates (2nd, 3rd trimesters) and placental tissue phthalates (birth). Potential confounders and modifiers were evaluated in categories: temporality (time between urine and placenta sample), fetal sex, demographics, social advantage, reproductive history, medication use, nutrition and adiposity. Molar and quantile normalized phthalates were calculated to facilitate comparison of placental and urinary levels. Metabolites detectable in >80% of both urine and placental samples were MEP, MnBP, MBzP, MECPP, MEOHP, MEHHP, and MEHP. MEP was most abundant in urine (geometric mean [GM] 7.00 ×102 nmol/l) and in placental tissue (GM 2.56 ×104 nmol/l). MEHP was the least abundant in urine (GM 5.32 ×101 nmol/l) and second most abundant in placental tissue (2.04 ×104 nmol/l). In aggregate, MEHP differed the most between urine and placenta (2.21 log units), and MEHHP differed the least (0.07 log units). MECPP was positively associated between urine and placenta (regression coefficient: 0.31 95% CI 0.09, 0.53). Other urine-placenta metabolite associations were modified by measures of social advantage, reproductive history, medication use, and adiposity. Phthalates were ubiquitous in 50 full-term placental samples, as has already been shown in maternal urine. MEP and MEHP were the most abundant. Measurement and comparison of urinary and placental phthalates can advance knowledge on phthalate toxicity in pregnancy and provide insight into the validity and accuracy of relying on maternal urinary concentrations to estimate placental exposures. This is the first report of correlations/associations of urinary and placental tissue phthalates in human pregnancy. Epidemiologists have relied exclusively on maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations to assess exposures in pregnant women and risk to their fetuses. Even though it has not yet been confirmed empirically, it is widely assumed that urinary concentrations are strongly and positively correlated with placental and fetal levels.

However, how low dose of these EDCs and their mixture would affect fetal rat testis development still needs further investigation. Moreover, testis organ culture system also needs further modification to provide an effective tool for ex vivo EDCs study. Methods: We firstly modified the agarose organ culture system, in which fetal rat testes were cultured for 4 days (d1 to d4) on agarose gels held by Millicell inserts. Then we used the modified agarose culture system to study the combined effects of multiple EDCs exposure. 15.5 dpc fetal rat testes were isolated and treated with vehicle, MEHP (0.1 μmol/L), GEN (0.1 μmol/L) or MEHP (0.1 μmol/L) + GEN (0.1 μmol/L). Parameters concerning testicular cell development and function were evaluated, trying to gain insight into the early molecular events after multiple EDCs exposure. Results: The development of somatic, germ cells and seminiferous tubule in 15.5 dpc fetal rat testis was better sustained in the modified agarose culture system. Based on the modified system, we found that MEHP at 0.1 μmol/L induced alterations in gonocyte markers, antioxidative enzyme activity as well as transient reduction of testosterone production, accompanied by mitochondria swelling in gonocytes and Sertoli cells. No obvious morphological and histological alterations were observed in all treated groups. However, coadministration of genistein at 0.1 μmol/L partially alleviated MEHP-induced fetal testis damage ex vivo through enhancement of antioxidative action. MEHP at low dose still showed weak endocrine disrupting properties but did not exhibit typical low-dose effects. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that the modified agarose culture system could better mimic testicular microenvironment without obvious hypoxic cell damage. Furthermore, low dose of MEHP induced mild disruption to fetal testis development, cotreatment of genistein at low dose attenuated MEHP induced fetal testis injuries in part by balancing redox state, indicating that low dose of genistein may partially protect fetal testis from phthalates induced injury.",PMC9465295

Decidualization is the morphological and functional change that endometrial stromal cells undergo to support endometrial receptivity, which is crucial for successful implantation, placentation, and pregnancy. We investigated the effect of nine selected EDCs on primary human endometrial stromal cell decidualization in vitro. The cells were exposed to a decidualization-inducing mixture in the presence or absence of 1 μM of nine different EDCs for nine days. Extent of decidualization was assessed by measuring the activity of cAMP dependent protein kinase, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase, and protein kinase B in lysates using photoluminescent probes, and secretion of prolactin into the media by using ELISA. Decidualization-inducing mixture upregulated activity of protein kinases and prolactin secretion in cells derived from all women. Of the tested chemicals, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) significantly reduced decidualization as judged by the kinase markers and prolactin secretion. In addition, bisphenol A (BPA) reduced prolactin secretion but did not significantly affect activity of the kinases. None of the EDCs was cytotoxic, based on the assessment of total protein content or activity of the viability marker casein kinase 2 in lysates. These results indicate that EDCs commonly present in the blood circulation of reproductive-aged women can reduce decidualization of human endometrial stromal cells in vitro.

To determine whether maternal exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) influences adult serum INSL3 concentration, using a retrospective paradigm, INSL3 was measured in young adult male rats (80-90 days) from the F1 generation of females maternally exposed to varied doses of bisphenol A (BPA), butylparaben, epoxiconazole, and fludioxonil as single compounds, as well as estrogenic and anti-androgenic mixtures of BPA and butylparaben, and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and procymidone respectively. A mixture of BPA and butylparaben significantly reduced circulating INSL3 concentration in adult male progeny. The remaining compounds or mixtures tested, though sufficient to induce other effects in the F1 generation were without significant effect. Maternal exposure to low concentrations of some EDCs may be a contributing factor to the variation in the Leydig cell biomarker INSL3 in young adulthood, though caution is warranted translating results from rats to humans.",PMC10078366

These endocrine disruptors can be released into the environment and food, resulting in the continuous exposure of humans to bisphenols (BPs). The bladder urothelium is chronically exposed to BPA and BPS due to their presence in human urine samples. BPA and BPS exposure has been linked to cancer progression, especially for hormone-dependent cancers. However, the bladder is not recognized as a hormone-dependent tissue. Still, the presence of hormone receptors on the urothelium and their role in bladder cancer initiation and progression suggest that BPs could impact bladder cancer development. The effects of chronic exposure to BPA and BPS for 72 h on the bioenergetics (glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration), proliferation and migration of normal urothelial cells and non-invasive and invasive bladder cancer cells were evaluated. The results demonstrate that chronic exposure to BPs decreased urothelial cells' energy metabolism and properties while increasing them for bladder cancer cells. These findings suggest that exposure to BPA and BPS could promote bladder cancer development with a potential clinical impact on bladder cancer progression. Further studies using 3D models would help to understand the clinical consequences of this exposure.",PMC9406715

Nevertheless, limited data are available on its effects during basal folliculogenesis. In this study, we evaluate in vitro the effects of a long-term BPS exposure on a model of basal follicular development in a mono-ovulatory species. We cultured ovine preantral follicles (180−240 μm, n = 168) with BPS (0.1 μM (possible human exposure dose) or 10 μM (high dose)) and monitored antrum appearance and follicular survival and growth for 15 days. We measured hormonal secretions (oestradiol (at day 13 [D13]), progesterone and anti-Müllerian hormone [D15]) and expression of key follicular development and redox status genes (D15) in medium and whole follicles, respectively. BPS (0.1 µM) decreased oestradiol secretion compared with the control (−48.8%, p < 0.001), without significantly impairing antrum appearance, follicular survival and growth, anti-Müllerian hormone and progesterone secretion and target gene expression. Thus, BPS could also impair oestradiol secretion during basal folliculogenesis as it is the case during terminal folliculogenesis. It questions the use of BPS as a safe BPA substitute in the human environment. More studies are required to elucidate mechanisms of action of BPS and its effects throughout basal follicular development.",PMC9412475

This study aims to describe the association between maternal diet during pregnancy and exposure to persistent EDCs using dietary pattern analysis. This study is based on subsamples of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (N=422) and the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) (N=276) which uses data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN). Women in both studies completed food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) during pregnancy, from which consumption data were categorized into 38 aggregated food groups. Maternal blood samples were collected during pregnancy and concentrations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in serum/plasma were measured. Dietary patterns were identified using reduced rank regression, with blood EDC concentrations as response variables. Within ALSPAC, all patterns (PFAS, PCB, and OCP) were characterized by high consumption of meat, poultry, white fish, and biscuits. In MoBa, high consumption of sausages and burgers (representing processed meats), pasta, and chocolate bars characterized PCB and OCP dietary patterns, while high consumption of cheese characterized the PFAS pattern. Across both cohorts, PFAS patterns were characterized by high consumption of cheese, PCB patterns by high consumption of rice, and OCP patterns by poultry. Dietary patterns explained between 8 and 20% of the variation in serum EDC concentrations, with explained variance being the highest for PCBs in both cohorts. In conclusion, dietary patterns high in animal-based products appear to be associated with persistent EDC concentrations among pregnant women. Diet explains more variation in PCB concentrations than for other persistent EDC classes.",PMC9380587

One of the most commonly used phthalates, di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP), has been linked with adverse reproductive health outcomes in men, but the mechanisms behind these effects are still poorly understood. Here, adult male mice were orally exposed to DBP (10 or 100 mg/kg/day) for five weeks, and the testis and adrenal glands were collected one week after the last dose, to examine more persistent effects. Quantification of testosterone, androstenedione, progesterone and corticosterone concentrations by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that testicular testosterone was significantly decreased in both DBP treatment groups, whereas the other steroids were not significantly altered. Western blot analysis of testis revealed that DBP exposure increased the levels of the steroidogenic enzymes CYP11A1, HSD3β2, and CYP17A1, the oxidative stress marker nitrotyrosine, and the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR). The analysis further demonstrated increased levels of the germ cell marker DAZL, the Sertoli cell markers vimentin and SOX9, and the Leydig cell marker SULT1E1. Overall, the present work provides more mechanistic understanding of how adult DBP exposure can induce effects on the male reproductive system by affecting several key cells and proteins important for testosterone biosynthesis and spermatogenesis, and for the first time shows that these effects persist at least one week after the last dose. It also demonstrates impairment of testosterone biosynthesis at a lower dose than previously reported.",PMC9369267

Hitherto, BPA was regarded as the bisphenol to which people were exposed to the greatest extent. As endocrine disruptors, bisphenols have negative effects on human health. Therefore, defining the levels of human exposure to these compounds is a key issue in toxicology. Hair analysis has been increasingly used for biomonitoring of bisphenols in humans, but information about the coexistence of BPA and BPS in human hair is extremely scarce. The present study aimed to analyze hair samples from 25 individuals from Olsztyn, northeastern Poland, to evaluate the levels of these 2 industrial pollutants. MATERIAL AND METHODS The method used in the research was liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometry technique. RESULTS BPA was found in 72% of samples analyzed and its concentration levels fluctuated from 3.6 to 52.9 ng/g (median 17.7 ng/g). The BPS concentration levels were higher - from 13.4 to 1054.9 ng/g (median 98.7 ng/g). We also found that gender, age, and the presence of artificial hair color (hair dye) did not affect the BPA and BPS levels in the hair. CONCLUSIONS This study has shown that hair samples may be used to measure the levels of bisphenols, and that exposure to BPS may be greater than that to BPA in this area. The investigation also revealed that hair analysis is a useful approach for the biomonitoring of BPA and BPS levels in human organisms.",PMC9361778

The target analysis approach (including enzymatic hydrolysis, clean-up by solid-phase extraction and analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)) was optimized, validated and applied to volunteers' samples, in which 67% of the target EDCs were quantified. For instance, benzophenone-3 (0.2-13 ng g-1), bisphenol A (7.7-13.7 ng g-1), methyl 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate (8-254 ng g-1), mono butyl phthalate (2-17 ng g-1) and triclosan (0.3-9 ng g-1) were found at the highest concentrations, but the presence of other analogues was detected as well. The developed target method was further extended to suspect and non-target screening (SNTS) by means of LC coupled to high-resolution MS/MS. First, well-defined workflows for SNTS were validated by applying the previously developed method to an extended list of compounds (83), and then, to the same real urine samples. From a list of approximately 4000 suspects, 33 were annotated at levels from 1 to 3, with food additives/ingredients and personal care products being the most abundant ones. In the non-target approach, the search was limited to molecules containing S, Cl and/or Br atoms, annotating 4 pharmaceuticals. The results from this study showed that the combination of the lower limits of detection of MS/MS and the identification power of high-resolution MS/MS is still compulsory for a more accurate definition of human exposome in urine samples.",PMC9436830

Bisphenol-A (BPA) is an ED by-product of the plastic industry and one of the chemicals with the highest volume produced yearly. Here, we studied the role of cholesterol in the BPA exposure effects over membrane models. We used Langmuir films of both neat lipid DPPC (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and cholesterol (Chol) and a binary mixture containing DPPC/Chol, exposing it to BPA. We evaluate changes in the π-A isotherms and the PM-IRRAS (polarization modulation-infrared reflection adsorption spectroscopy) spectra. BPA exposure induced changes in the DPPC and Chol neat monolayers, causing mean molecular area expansion and altering profiles. However, at high surface pressure, the BPA was expelled from the air-water interface. For the DPPC/Chol mixture, BPA caused expansion throughout the whole compression, indicating that BPA is present at the monolayer interface. The PM-IRRAS analysis showed that BPA interacted with the phosphate group of DPPC through hydrogen bonding, which caused the area's expansion. Such evidence might be biologically relevant to better understand the mechanism of action of BPA in cell membranes once phosphatidylcholines and Chol are found in mammalian membranes.",PMC9332047

Since animals are also exposed to bisphenols, we hypothesised that these substances may have an effect on uterine contractility in pigs. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of the most-used bisphenol, bisphenol A (BPA), and a selected analogue, bisphenol F (BPF), on the contractile activity of the pig uterus. The investigation utilised smooth muscles from immature pigs (n = 6), cyclic pigs on days 12-14 of the oestrous cycle (n = 6) or early pregnant pigs on days 12-16 of pregnancy (n = 6). Strips of the myometrium were exposed to BPA and BPF at concentrations of 10-13-10-1 M. Smooth muscle contractility was determined with equipment for measuring isometric contractions. BPA caused a significant decrease in contraction amplitude, and frequency and in myometrial tension in all groups examined. BPF caused a decrease in the amplitude and frequency of contractions in all groups and in myometrial tension in the early pregnant group. The obtained results indicate that both BPA and BPF relaxed the porcine myometrium, but these changes, especially in the amplitude and frequency of contractions, were more evident after BPF treatment. The extent of relaxation is dependent on the physiological status of the animals.",PMC9281530

We optimized the preparation of lac@CS-NHTs by controlling one-factor variable method and response surface methodology (RSM). The cubic polynomial regression model via Design-Expert 12 was developed to describe the optimal preparation conditions of immobilized laccase. Under the optimal conditions, lac@CS-NHTs obtained the maximum enzyme activity, and the enzyme loading was as high as 60.10 mg/g. The results of batch removal experiment of BPA showed that under the optimum treatment condition, the BPA removal rate of lac@CS-NHTs, FL and heat-inactivated lac@CS-NHTs was 87.31 %, 60.89 % and 24.54 %, respectively, which indicated that the contribution of biodegradation was greater than adsorption. In addition, the relative activity of lac@CS-NHTs dropped to about 44.24 % after 8 cycles of BPA removal, which demonstrated that lac@CS-NHTs have the potential to reduce costs in practical applications.

TTP was defined as the number of prospectively observed menstrual cycles a couple attempted pregnancy until the occurrence of a human chorionic gonadotropic-detected pregnancy. Urinary concentrations of two BP-type UV filters and three phthalate metabolites were measured at baseline. Fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each chemical adjusting for age, body mass index, serum cotinine, creatinine, and accounting for right censoring and left truncation. Models evaluated effect modification between EDC concentrations and TTP by partner's age, dichotomized at 35 years. Separate models were run for male and female partners. No significant effect modification was observed for any EDC for either partner, but data were suggestive of a longer TTP among females aged ≥35 years, particularly for BP-2 (FOR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.36, 1.05) and 4-hydroxybenzophenone (FOR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.09) reflecting 39% and 29% reductions in fecundability, respectively.

These substances include pesticides (benzoylureas, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids), persistent organic pollutants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluorinated compounds), plasticizers (phthalate esters, phenolic endocrine disruptors), medicines (sulfonamides, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, tetracyclines, fluoroquinone antibiotics), heterocyclic aromatic amines, algal toxins, and radioactive substances. Discharge of these toxic and harmful substances, as well as their possible persistence and bioaccumulation, pose a major risk to human health, often to the extent of being life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to analyze and detect toxic and hazardous substances in the environment, drinking water, food, and daily commodities. Sample pretreatment is an imperative step in most of the currently used analytical methods, especially in the analysis of trace toxic and harmful substances in complex samples. An efficient and fast sample pretreatment technology not only helps improve the sensitivity, selectivity, reproducibility, and accuracy of analytical methods, but also avoids contamination of the analytical instruments and even damages the performance and working life of instruments. Sample pretreatment techniques widely used in the extraction of toxic and hazardous substances include solid-phase extraction (SPE), solid-phase microextraction (SPME), and dispersed solid-phase extraction (DSPE). The adsorbent material plays a key role in these pretreatment techniques, thereby determining their selectivity and efficiency. In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted increasing attention in sample pretreatment. COFs represent an exciting new class of porous crystalline materials constructed via the strong covalent bonding of organic building units through a reversible condensation reaction. COFs present four advantages: (1) precise control over structure type and pore size by consideration of the target molecular structure based on the connectivity and shape of the building units; (2) post-synthetic modification for chemical optimization of the pore interior toward optimized interaction with the target; (3) straightforward scalable synthesis; (4) feasible formation of composites with magnetic nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, graphene, silica, etc., which is beneficial to enhance the performance of COFs and meet the requirement of diverse pretreatment technologies. Because of the well-defined crystalline porous structures and tailored functionalities, COFs have excellent potential for use in target extraction. However, some issues need to be addressed for the application of COFs in the extraction of toxic and hazardous substances. (1) For the sample matrix, most of the reported COFs are highly hydrophobic, which limits their dispersibility in water-based samples, leading to poor extraction performance. COFs with good dispersibility in water-based samples are urgently required. (2) Besides, COFs rely on hydrophobic interaction, size repulsion, π-π stacking, and Van der Waals forces to extract target substances, but they are not effective for some polar targets. Thus, it is necessary to develop COFs with high affinity for polar toxic and hazardous substances. (3) Methods for the synthesis of COFs have evolved from solvothermal methods to room-temperature methods, mechanical grinding, microwave-assisted synthesis, ion thermal methods, etc. Most of the existing methods are time-consuming, laborious, and environmentally unfriendly. The starting materials are too expensive to prepare COFs in large quantities.

Both natural and synthetic compounds have the ability to impact reproductive health by altering the structure and/or function of genes and proteins that facilitate normal ovarian and endometrial functions. This mini-review aims to summarize the effects of some of the most common EDCs on female fertility, including the effects of pesticides and plasticizer alternatives (phthalates, bisphenol A), based on available data in human studies. A literature search was performed using the key words ""pesticides, fertility, reproduction, plasticizers, bisphenol A, phthalate, miscarriage, and in vitro fertilization."" The data supporting EDCs' role in female infertility remain limited, but existing evidence suggests that exposure may have an adverse impact. Accumulating evidence in animal studies provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying EDC effects. As dose-response dynamics are better elucidated, understanding the effects of EDCs on female fertility will help in the development of guidelines for both industry and individuals.",PMC9250118

Hence, most people are exposed to BPA via the skin, digestive system or inhalation in everyday life. Furthermore, BPA crosses the blood-brain barrier and is linked to multiple neurological dysfunctions found in neurodegenerative and neuropsychological disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying BPA-associated neurological dysfunctions remain poorly understood. Here, we report that BPA exposure alters synapse morphology and function in the cerebral cortex. Cortical pyramidal neurons treated with BPA showed reduced size and number of dendrites and spines. The density of excitatory synapses was also decreased by BPA treatment. More importantly, we found that BPA disrupted normal synaptic transmission and cognitive behavior. RGS4 and its downstream BDNF/NTRK2 pathway appeared to mediate the effect of BPA on synaptic and neurological function. Our findings provide molecular mechanistic insights into anatomical and physiological neurotoxic consequences related to a potent endocrine modifier.",PMC9346518

Our laboratory previously developed an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture consisting of 6 phthalates and found that it disrupted female fertility in mice. However, it was unknown if maternal exposure to the mixture affects reproductive parameters and ovarian post-transcription in the F1 and F2 generation of female rats. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that maternal exposure to the phthalate mixture affects folliculogenesis, steroidogenesis, and ovarian microRNA (miRNA) in the F1 and F2 generations of female rats. Pregnant female rats were divided into 4 groups and orally dosed daily from gestational day 10 to postnatal day 21 with corn oil (control group), 20 μg/kg/day, 200 μg/kg/day, or 200 mg/kg/day of the phthalate mixture. Maternal exposure to the phthalate mixture impaired folliculogenesis in the F1 and F2 generations of female rats and affected steroidogenesis in the F1 generation of female rats compared to control. Further, the phthalate mixture altered ovarian expression of some genes related to the cell cycle and steroidogenesis compared to control in the F1 and F2 generations of female rats. The mixture also increased ovarian expression of rno-mir-184 that is involved with the oocyte maturation process. Collectively, our data show that maternal exposure to the phthalate mixture affects folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis in the F1 and F2 generations of female rats and alters ovarian miRNA expression in the F1 generation of female rats.",PMC9801715

The bisphenols exposure is associated with several modes of action including negative impact on the blood-testis barrier (BTB) in testes or direct effect on spermatozoa. Bisphenols have been detected in human seminal plasma, but the possible mechanism of seminal transfer of bisphenols is not clear. Some authors consider the transfer through the blood-testis barrier to be crucial. Therefore, in this work, we compared normozoospermic men and men after vasectomy who have interrupted vas deferens and their ejaculate does not contain testicular products. We measured the concentration of bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol F (BPF) in the urine and seminal plasma of these men using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MSMS). We found that the ratio of urinary and seminal plasma content of bisphenols did not differ in normozoospermic men or men after vasectomy. From the obtained data, it can be concluded that the pathways of transport of bisphenols into seminal plasma are not primarily through the testicular tissue, but this pathway is applied similarly to other routes of transmission by a corresponding ejaculate volume ratio. To a much greater extent than through testicular tissue, bisphenols enter the seminal plasma mainly as part of the secretions of the accessory glands.",PMC9230672

This study was designed to investigate their combined effect on the adipogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs). Cells were exposed for 14 days to an equimolar mixture of bisphenols (MIX) (range 10 nM-10 µM). Oil Red staining was used to measure intracellular lipid accumulation, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to study gene expression of adipogenic markers (PPARγ, C/EBPα, LPL, and FABP4), and Western Blot to determine their corresponding proteins. The MIX promoted intracellular lipid accumulation in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal response at 10 µM. Co-incubation with pure antiestrogen (ICI 182,780) inhibited lipid accumulation, suggesting that the effect was mediated by the estrogen receptor. The MIX also significantly altered the expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, LPL, and FABP4 markers, observing a non-monotonic (U-shaped) dose-response, with maximal gene expression at 10 nM and 10 µM and lesser expression at 1 µM. This pattern was not observed when bisphenols were tested individually. Exposure to MIX (1-10 µM) also increased all encoded proteins except for FABP4, which showed no changes.

Tooth enamel, with its unique properties, is able to record certain environmental conditions during its formation. Enamel formation and quality are dependent on hormonal regulation and environmental conditions, including exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Among EDCs, phthalates such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) raise concerns about their contribution to various pathologies, including those of mineralized tissues. The effects of exposure to low-doses of DEHP on the continually growing incisors were analyzed in mouse males and females. Adult male and female C57BL/6J mice were exposed daily to 0.5, 5, and 50μg/kg per day DEHP for 12 wk and their incisors clinically examined. Incisors of males were further analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro X-ray computed tomography (micro-computed tomography; μCT), and nanoindentation for the enamel, histology and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for the dental epithelium. Clinical macroscopic observations of incisors showed various dose-dependent dental lesions such as opacities, scratches, and enamel breakdown in 30.5% of males (10 of 34 total incisors across three independent experiments), and 15.6% of females (7 of 46 incisors) at the highest dose, among which 18.1% (6 of 34 total incisors across three independent experiments) and 8.9% (4 of 46 incisors), respectively, had broken incisors. SEM showed an altered enamel surface and ultrastructure in DEHP-exposed male mice. Further characterization of the enamel defects in males by μCT showed a lower mineral density than controls, and nanoindentation showed a lower enamel hardness during all stages of enamel mineralization, with more pronounced alterations in the external part of the enamel. A delay in enamel mineralization was shown by several approaches (μCT, histology, and RT-qPCR). We conclude that DEHP disrupted enamel development in mice by directly acting on dental cells with higher prevalence and severity in males than in females. The time window of DEHP effects on mouse tooth development led to typical alterations of structural, biochemical, and mechanical properties of enamel comparable to other EDCs, such as bisphenol A. The future characterization of dental defects in humans and animals due to environmental toxicants might be helpful in proposing them as early markers of exposure to such molecules. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10208.",PMC9215264

Endocrine disruptors may affect uric acid metabolism; however, few epidemiologic studies have been performed in children regarding newly developed bisphenol A (BPA) substitutes. We evaluated the associations between BPA, bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol F (BPF) exposure and serum uric acid concentrations in 6-year-old Korean children. From the Environment and Development of Children cohort study, six-year-old children (N = 489; 251 boys) who underwent an examination during 2015-2017 were included. Anthropometry, questionnaires, and biological samples were evaluated. BPA, BPS, and BPF levels were measured from spot urine samples, and log-transformed or categorized into groups for analysis. We constructed linear regression models adjusting for age, sex, urinary creatinine levels, body mass index z-scores, and estimated glomerular filtration rates. Mean serum uric level was 4.2 mg dL-1 (0.8 SD) without sex-differences. Among the three bisphenols, higher BPS exposure was associated with increased serum uric acid concentrations (P-value for trend = 0.002). When BPS levels were categorized into three groups (non-detection < 0.02 μg L-1 vs. medium BPS; 0.02-0.05 μg L-1 vs. high BPS ≥ 0.05 μg L-1), the high BPS group showed higher serum uric acid concentrations (by 0.26 mg dL-1, P = 0.003) than the non-detection group after adjusting for covariates, which was significant in boys but not girls. Urinary BPS levels was positively associated with serum uric acid concentrations in 6-year-old children, and the association was more pronounced in boys.

Most recently, there has been interest in the impacts of phthalates on the placenta, a transient major endocrine organ critical to maintenance of the uterine environment and fetal development. Phthalate-induced changes in placental structure and function may have significant impacts on the course of pregnancy and ultimately, child health. Prior reviews have described the literature on phthalates and placental health; however to date, there has been no comprehensive, systematic review on this topic. Here, we review 35 papers (24 human and 11 animal studies) and summarize phthalate exposures in relation to an extensive set of placental measures. Phthalate-related alterations were reported for placental morphology, hormone production, vascularization, histopathology, and gene/protein expression. The most consistent changes were observed in vascular and morphologic endpoints, including cell composition. These changes have implications for pregnancy complications such as preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction as well as potential ramifications for children's health.

Exposure of women to EDCs has been associated with adverse reproductive health outcomes. The assays currently used to identify EDCs that elicit female reproductive toxicity lack screening tests that address effects on the maturation of oocytes, a process that enables them to be fertilized and develop into embryos. Here, a screening method employing the bovine model of in vitro oocyte maturation and embryo production is described. Endpoints explored address important events in oocyte maturation and developmental competence acquisition. To test the method, the effects of the known human EDC diethylstilbestrol (DES; an estrogen receptor agonist) were evaluated in a range of concentrations (10-9 M, 10-7 M, 10-5 M). Bovine oocytes were exposed to DES during in vitro maturation (IVM) or embryos were exposed during in vitro embryo culture (IVC). The endpoints evaluated included nuclear maturation, mitochondrial redistribution, cumulus cell expansion, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis. DES-exposed oocytes were fertilized to record embryo cleavage and blastocyst rates to uncover effects on developmental competence. Similarly, the development of embryos exposed to DES during IVC was monitored to assess the impact on early embryo development. Exposure to 10-9 M or 10-7 M DES did not affect the endpoints addressing oocyte maturation or embryo development. However, there were considerable detrimental effects observed in oocytes exposed to 10-5 M DES. Specifically, compared to vehicle-treated oocytes, there was a statistically significant reduction in nuclear maturation (3% vs 84%), cumulus expansion (2.8-fold vs 3.6-fold) and blastocyst rate (3% vs 32%). Additionally, progesterone and pregnenolone concentrations measured in IVM culture media were increased. The screening method described here shows that bovine oocytes were sensitive to the action of this particular chemical (i.e., DES), albeit at high concentrations. In principle, this method provides a valuable tool to assess the oocyte maturation process and early embryo development that can be used for reproductive toxicity screening and possibly EDC identification. Further studies should include EDCs with different mechanisms of action and additional endpoints to further demonstrate the applicability of the bovine oocyte model for chemical risk assessment purposes and EDC identification.",PMC9171015

Given the interaction between steroidogenesis and the metabolic status, the BPS effect was tested according to two diet groups. Eighty adult ewes were allotted to restricted (R) and well-fed (WF) groups, that were further subdivided into two subgroups. Ewes were exposed to 50 µg BPS/kg/day in their diet (R50 and WF50 groups) or were unexposed controls (R0 and WF0 groups). After at least 3 months of BPS exposure, preovulatory follicular fluid, oviduct fluid and plasma were collected and steroid hormones were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). A deleterious effect of restricted diet on the volume of oviduct fluid and numbers of pre-ovulatory follicles was observed. Exposure to BPS impaired estradiol concentrations in both follicular and oviduct fluids of well-fed ewes and progesterone, estradiol and estrone concentrations in plasma of restricted ewes.

These EDCs can disrupt hormone signaling in the human and animal body systems including the very important hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis causing adverse health effects. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are hormones of the HPT axis which are essential for regulation of metabolism, heart rate, body temperature, growth, development, etc. In this study, potential endocrine-disrupting activity of the most common phthalate plasticizer, DEHP, and emerging non-phthalate alternate plasticizers, DINCH, ATBC, and DEHA against thyroid hormone receptor (TRα) were characterized. The structural binding characterization of indicated ligands was performed against the TRα ligand binding site employing Schrodinger's induced fit docking (IFD) approach. The molecular simulations of interactions of the ligands against the residues lining a TRα binding pocket, including bonding interactions, binding energy, docking score, and IFD score were analyzed. In addition, the structural binding characterization of TRα native ligand, T3, was also done for comparative analysis. The results revealed that all ligands were placed stably in the TRα ligand-binding pocket. The binding energy values were highest for DINCH, followed by ATBC, and were higher than the values estimated for TRα native ligand, T3, whereas the values for DEHA and DEHP were similar and comparable to that of T3. This study suggested that all the indicated plasticizers have the potential for thyroid hormone disruption with two alternate plasticizers, DINCH and ATBC, exhibiting higher potential for thyroid dysfunction compared to DEHA and DEHP.",PMC9145736

Glyphosate is the active substance of the herbicide Roundup®, bisphenol A (BPA) and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) are used as plasticizers, while triclosan (TCS), methyl (MePB), propyl (PrPB), and butyl (BuPB) parabens are used as antimicrobial agents and preservatives mainly in personal care products. Studies indicate that exposure to these substances can affect humans causing developmental problems and problems in the endocrine, reproductive, nervous, immune, and respiratory systems. Although there are copious studies related to these substances, there are few in vivo studies related to combined exposure to these endocrine disruptors. The aim of the present pilot study is the investigation and assessment of the above substances' toxicity in rabbits after twelve months of exposure to glyphosate (both pure and commercial form) and to a mixture of all the above substances at subtoxic levels.

In this paper, the derivation of HBM-GVs for the general population (HBM-GVGenPop) and workers (HBM-GVworker) referring to bisphenol S (BPS) is presented. For the general population, this resulted in an estimation of the total urinary concentration of BPS of 1.0 µg/L assuming a 24 h continuous exposure to BPS. For workers, the modelling was refined in order to reflect continuous exposure during the working day, leading to a total urinary concentration of BPS of 3.0 µg/L. The usefulness for risk assessment of the HBM-GVs derived for BPS and bisphenol A (BPA) is illustrated. Risk Characterisation Ratios (RCRs) were calculated leading to a clear difference between risk assessments performed for both bisphenols, with a very low RCR regarding exposure to BPA., contrary to that obtained for BPS. This may be due to the endocrine mediated endpoints selected to derive the HBM-GVs for BPS, whereas the values calculated for BPA are based on the temporary Tolerable Daily Intake (t-TDI) from EFSA set in 2015. A comparison with the revised TDI recently opened for comments by EFSA is also discussed.

In a prospective birth cohort study, five first-morning urine samples collected across pregnancy were pooled and the following phthalate biomarkers assessed: sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP), sum of diisononyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDINP), sum of dibutyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDBP), sum of anti-androgenic metabolites (ΣAA), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), and sum of all phthalate metabolites (ΣAll). The Ages & Stages Questionnaires® (ASQ), a standardized parent-reported, age-adapted screening tool, measured communication, personal-social, problem solving, and motor domains in infants at 4.5 and 7.5 months (n = 123). Adjusting for maternal age, annual household income, gestational age at birth, infant age at assessment, and sex, repeated-measures generalized linear regression models were used to examine associations between prenatal phthalate urine biomarker concentrations and domain scores (assuming a Poisson distribution). Beta estimates were exponentiated back to the domain scale for ease of interpretation. Mothers were mostly white and college-educated, and most reported an annual household income of ≥$60,000. Associations of phthalate concentrations with ASQ outcomes are presented as follows: (1) anti-androgenic phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP, ΣDINP, ΣDBP, and ΣAA), (2) MEP, which is not anti-androgenic, and (3) ΣAll. Overall, anti-androgenic phthalates were associated with higher (i.e., better) scores. However, there were exceptions, including the finding that a one-unit increase in ΣDBP was associated with a 12% increase in problem solving scores in 4.5-month-old females (β = 1.12; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.28; p = 0.067) but a 85% decrease for 7.5-month-old females (β = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.99; p = 0.047). In contrast, MEP was associated with poorer scores on several outcomes.

Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case-control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00--1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02-1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00-1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00-1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis. These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.",PMC9109392

We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 µM). Bisphenol-A (BPA) and tributyltin (TBT) were used as controls while four other chemicals, namely perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), triphenylphosphate (TPP), triclosan (TCS) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), were used as ""unknowns"". Regarding cell viability, BPA and TBT increased cell death as previously observed. Their mode of action involved the activation of estrogen receptors and PPARγ, respectively. ROS production was a consistent key event in BPA-and TBT-treated cells. None of the other MDCs tested modified viability or ROS production. Concerning GSIS, TBT increased insulin secretion while BPA produced no effects. PFOA decreased GSIS, suggesting that this chemical could be a ""new"" diabetogenic agent.

The urinary levels of mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) were measured by using high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and mast cell releasability was determined after phthalate treatment. The levels of phthalate metabolites, especially di-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), are significantly increased in the urine of patients with urticaria compared to the healthy controls. The release of β-hexosaminidase in human mast cells is more significantly increased by MnBP, mono-benzyl phthalate, MEHHP, and MECPP compared to the negative controls; interestingly, the highest secretion of β-hexosaminidase is observed after the lowest stimulation of MECPP.

Due to their biodegradation resistance, they accumulate along the food chain and in the environment. Maternal exposure to PCBs may affect the fetus and the infant. PCBs are immunotoxic and may damage the developing immune system. PCBs are associated with elevated IgE antibodies in cord blood and are considered to be predictive of atopic reactions. Several studies on the association between prenatal exposure to PCBs and atopic reactions were previously published, albeit with conflicting results. Objectives: To examine the association between maternal PCBs levels and atopic reactions in their offspring. Methods: During the years 2013-2015, a prospective birth cohort was recruited at the delivery rooms of Shamir Medical Center (Assaf Harofeh) and ""Dana Dwek"" Children's Hospital. Four PCBs congeners were investigated: PCBs 118, 138, 153, and 180. In 2019, when children reached the age of 4-6 years, mothers were interviewed using the ISAAC questionnaire to assess symptoms of atopic reactions, including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Results: One hundred and fifty mother-child dyads were analyzed. No significant differences were found in the median serum PCBs concentrations of each studied congener or total PCBs for asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis diagnosis, or parent-reported symptoms. No association was found between exposure to total PCBs and the risk for asthma symptoms or diagnosis, adjusted to maternal age and family member with atopic condition: aOR = 0.94, 95%CI: (0.88; 0.99). No association was observed between each studied PCB congener and asthma symptoms or diagnosis. The same results were found also for other studied outcomes-allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. Conclusion: Our study joins a series of previous studies that attempt to shed light on environmental exposures in utero as influencing factors for atopic conditions in children. Our results reflect the complexity of the pathophysiology of these phenomena. No relationship between maternal serum PCBs levels was demonstrated for asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis.

This is the first study in which hair analysis has been used to biomonitor BPA in 30 dogs using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry techniques. The presence of BPA in concentration levels above the method detection limit (1.25 ng/g) was noted in 93.33% of samples.

Statistically significant differences in BPA concentration levels were found between animals with physiological weight and animals with abnormal weight (skinny and obese). In turn, differences between males and females, as well as between young, middle-aged and old dogs, were not statistically significant. The obtained results have clearly shown that hair analysis is a useful method to evaluate the exposure of dogs to BPA. This study also confirmed that dogs are exposed to BPA to a large extent, and this substance may play a role as a pathological factor in this animal species.

EDCs are ubiquitous and can be found in a variety of consumer products such as food packaging materials, personal care and household products, plastic additives, and flame retardants. Over the last decade, the impact of EDCs on human health has been widely acknowledged as they have been associated with different endocrine diseases. Among them, a subset called metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) is able to promote metabolic changes that can lead to the development of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic syndrome, among others. Despite this, today, there are still no definitive and standardized in vitro tools to support the metabolic risk assessment of existing and emerging MDCs for regulatory purposes. Here, we evaluated the following two different pancreatic cell-based in vitro systems: the murine pancreatic β-cell line MIN6 as well as the human pancreatic β-cell line EndoC-βH1. Both were challenged with the following range of relevant concentrations of seven well-known EDCs: (bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), bisphenol-F (BPF), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), cadmium chloride (CdCl2), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE)). The screening revealed that most of the tested chemicals have detectable, deleterious effects on glucose-stimulated insulin release, insulin content, electrical activity, gene expression, and/or viability. Our data provide new molecular information on the direct effects of the selected chemicals on key aspects of pancreatic β-cell function, such as the stimulus-secretion coupling and ion channel activity. In addition, we found that, in general, the sensitivity and responses were comparable to those from other in vivo studies reported in the literature.

Fetal growth outcomes included birthweight and length, and ultrasound-derived size and velocity of estimated fetal weight, femur length, abdominal and head circumferences in the second and third trimesters. We used a novel application of quantile g-computation to estimate the joint association between pregnancy-averaged phthalate exposure and fetal growth, and to examine effect modification of that association by infant sex or omega-3 intake during pregnancy. There were few statistically significant differences in birth size and fetal growth by exposure. A one-quartile increase in the phthalate mixture was modestly associated with reduced birthweight(β [95% confidence interval)]: -54.6 [-128.9, 19.7] grams; p = 0.15) and length (-0.2 [-0.6, 0.2] centimeters; p = 0.40).

Dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP) is a widely used phthalate plasticizer; whether and how exposure to DCHP elicits adverse effects in vivo is mostly unknown. We previously reported that DCHP is a potent ligand of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) which acts as a xenobiotic sensor to regulate xenobiotic metabolism. PXR also functions in macrophages to regulate atherosclerosis development in animal models. In the current study, LDL receptor-deficient mice with myeloid-specific PXR deficiency (PXRΔMyeLDLR-/-) and their control littermates (PXRF/FLDLR-/-) were used to determine the impact of DCHP exposure on macrophage function and atherosclerosis. Chronic exposure to DCHP significantly increased atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic root and brachiocephalic artery of PXRF/FLDLR-/- mice by 65% and 77%, respectively. By contrast, DCHP did not affect atherosclerosis development in PXRΔMyeLDLR-/- mice. Exposure to DCHP led to elevated expression of the scavenger receptor CD36 in macrophages and increased macrophage form cell formation in PXRF/FLDLR-/- mice.

Current vaginal ring use, a form of hormonal contraception placed inside the vagina, was strongly associated with higher concentrations of high molecular weight phthalate biomarkers (k-means clustering: OR = 2.42, 95% CI = 1.28, 4.59; PCA: β = -0.32, 95% CI = -0.71, 0.07). Several dietary, reproductive, and demographic correlates were also associated with mixtures of EDC biomarkers. These findings suggest that personal care product use, diet, and contraceptive use may be sources of exposure to multiple non-persistent EDCs among reproductive-aged Black women.

Environmental EDCs are implicated in a range of diseases/disorders with developmental origins, including neurodevelopment and behavior. EDCs are most often studied one by one; here, we assessed outcomes induced by a mixture designed to represent the real-world situation of multiple simultaneous exposures. The choice of EDCs, which we refer to as ""NeuroMix,"" was informed by evidence for neurobiological effects in single-compound studies and included bisphenols, phthalates, vinclozolin, and perfluorinated, polybrominated, and polychlorinated compounds. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were fed the NeuroMix or vehicle, and then offspring of both sexes were assessed for effects on postnatal development and behaviors and gene expression in the brain in adulthood. In order to determine whether early-life EDCs predisposed to subsequent vulnerability to postnatal life challenges, a subset of rats were also given a stress challenge in adolescence. Prenatal NeuroMix exposure decreased body weight and delayed puberty in males but not females. In adulthood, NeuroMix caused changes in anxiety-like, social, and mate preference behaviors only in females. Effects of stress were predominantly observed in males. Several interactions of NeuroMix and stress were found, especially for the mate preference behavior and gene expression in the brain. These findings provide novel insights into how two realistic environmental challenges lead to developmental and neurobehavioral deficits, both alone and in combination, in a sex-specific manner.",PMC8954446

We pooled 1−4 urines collected after fibroid diagnosis over the consecutive weeks to analyze nine phthalate metabolites and calculate relevant molar sums (e.g., di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, ΣDEHP; anti-androgenic phthalates, ΣAA; all metabolites, ΣPhthalates). Using Poisson regression, we evaluated associations between phthalate biomarkers and the risk of having fibroid diagnosis. We explored if associations differed by weight gain from age 18 to 45−54 or in women diagnosed with fibroids within 5 years of phthalate assessment.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a pollutant, classified as an endocrine-disrupting chemical compound with estrogenic properties, their exposure in the early stages of neonatal life leads to an increase in the size and weight of breast tumors and induces cellular changes in the tumoral immune microenvironment where cytokines play a key role. Thus, we used female BALB/c mice exposed neonatally to a single dose of BPA. Once mice reached sexual maturity, a mammary tumor was induced, injecting 4T1 cells in situ. After 25 days of injection, we evaluated endocrine alterations, cytokine expression, tissue alterations denoted by macro or micro-metastasis in the lung, and cell infiltration induced by metastasis. We found that BPA neonatal treatment did not show significant endocrine alterations. Noteworthy, BPA led to an augmented rate of metastasis to the lung associated with higher intratumoral expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and VEGF.

We evaluated 13 maternal sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, enrollment year, and conception season as determinants of exposure biomarkers of phthalates and their replacements in 482 pregnant women from the Illinois Kids Development Study (I-KIDS, enrolled 2013-2018). We quantified 19 phthalate/replacement metabolites in pools of five first-morning urines collected across pregnancy. K-means clustering identified women with distinct patterns of biomarker concentrations and principal component analysis (PCA) identified principal component (PC) profiles of biomarkers that exist together. We used multivariable regression models to evaluate associations of predictors with identified k-means clusters and PCs. K-means clustering identified two clusters of women: 1) low phthalate/di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (∑DEHTP) and 2) high phthalate/∑DEHTP biomarker concentrations. PCA identified four PCs with loadings heaviest for biomarkers of plasticizer phthalates [di-isononyl, di-isodecyl, di-n-octyl phthalates] (PC1), of other phthalates [dibenzyl, di-n-butyl, di-iso-butyl phthalates] (PC2), of phthalate replacements [∑DEHTP, di(isononyl) cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (∑DiNCH)] (PC3), and of monoethyl phthalate [MEP] (PC4).

The aim of the study is to assess the interference of five pesticides on estrogen biosynthesis and estrogen signaling. Three neonicotinoid insecticides (Acetamiprid, Clothianidin, and Thiamethoxam), a carbamate insecticide (Methiocarb) and a herbicide (Oxadiazon) were tested. The effect of pesticides on estrogen biosynthesis was studied through an ELISA assay using a recombinant form of human aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of androgens to estrogens. Moreover, the effect of pesticides on estrogen signaling was assessed using a gene reporter assay on MELN cells, which measures estrogen receptor-mediated estrogenic activity. The results of the ELISA assay showed that the pesticides did not alter aromatase activity (no interference with estrogen biosynthesis), while the results of the gene reporter assay showed that only Methiocarb was able to alter estrogen signaling at high doses. The estrogenic activity of Methiocarb, expressed as 17β-estradiol equivalency factor (EEF), was equal to 8.0 × 10-8. In conclusion, this study suggested that Methiocarb should be considered a potential endocrine disruptor.",PMC8871760

Wuhan has numerous and diverse types of lakes which receive micropollutants from different pathways. In this study, the spatial distribution, occurrence, quantity and ecological risks of EDCs in 12 lakes were investigated. Five EDCs, including 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (17α-EE2), estrone (E1), β-estradiol (β-E2), estriol (E3) and bisphenol A (BPA) were detected in surface waters. The distribution of EDC content in the lakes was ordered as follows: exurban zone < suburban area < urban areas. The pollution sources in remote lakes mainly included agricultural and aquaculture wastewater, while those in suburban and urban areas included domestic or industrial wastewater. Areas with higher EDC content were frequently related to agricultural activities, aquaculture water or dense populations. Water quality parameters, including dissolved oxygen, pH and water temperature, were significantly related to the occurrence and distribution of EDCs in the lakes. Risk assessment demonstrated that the occurrence of EDCs posed minimum to medium risk to aquatic organisms in the lakes. The results showed that the lakes faced a threat hormone pollution though it was at lower doses and, thus, the ecological risk of EDCs should be considered in future environmental policies and decisions in China.",PMC8880694

Here, we assessed reproductive and sociosexual behavioral outcomes of prenatal Aroclor 1221 (A1221), a lightly chlorinated mix of PCBs known to have weakly estrogenic mechanisms of action; estradiol benzoate (EB), a positive control; or vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil) in F1-, F2-, and F3-generation male and female rats. Treatment with EDCs was given on embryonic day (E) 16 and 18, and F1 offspring monitored for development and adult behavior. F2 offspring were generated by breeding with untreated rats, phenotyping of F2s was performed in adulthood, and the F3 generation were similarly produced and phenotyped. Although no effects of treatment were found on F1 or F3 development and physiology, in the F2 generation, body weight in males and uterine weight in females were increased by A1221. Mating behavior results in F1 and F2 generations showed that F1 A1221 females had a longer latency to lordosis. In males, the F2 generation showed decreased mount frequency in the EB group. In the F3 generation, numbers of ultrasonic vocalizations were decreased by EB in males, and by EB and A1221 when the sexes were combined. Finally, partner preference tests in the F3 generation revealed that naïve females preferred F3-EB over untreated males, and that naïve males preferred untreated over F3-EB or F3-A1221 males.

The introduction of phthalates is reported to have occurred in the late 1920s, and there has been a significant rise in their release into the environment in past decades due to a lack of covalent bonding with the parent matrix. Because of their numerous applications in day-to-day life, phthalates have become ubiquitous and also classified as endocrine disruptors. Hence, several studies have been conducted to investigate the phthalate-mediated toxicities in animals; however, plants have not been explored to the same amount. Therefore, in the present study, the accumulation and translocation along with morpho-physiological perturbations in barley plants after 15, 30, 60, and 120 days of exposure to di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) are investigated using standard protocols. The maximal accumulation and translocation of DBP in the roots and shoots of barley plants was observed after 60 days of exposure. The exposure of DBP from 15 to 120 days was recorded to decline all the morphological indices (i.e., dry weight, net primary productivity, seed number per spike, and seed weight) of barley plants. The pigments content declined under DBP treatment for all exposure durations except 120 days exposure. Carbohydrate content increased after 15-30 days of exposure afterward it was observed to be decreased under 60 and 120 days of exposure. The protein content was declined in DBP stressed plants for 15-120 days. Proline content was increased in all exposure durations and maximal percent increase was recorded in 120 days of exposure. MDA content showed an increase at earlier exposure durations then followed by a decline in long-term exposure. Hydrogen peroxide content increased at all exposure durations. There were significant alterations observed in the activities of all antioxidative enzymes in comparison to the control. Furthermore, DBP stressed plants after 60 days were analyzed for the macromolecular variations using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Thus, the outcomes of the current work provide an appraisal of phthalates' uptake and translocation mediated phytotoxic responses in barley plants. These observations can help in developing genetically modified edible plants that are resistant to phthalates uptake, thereby ensuring food security.",PMC8852270

We began by developing single-cell imaging and informatic workflows to query whether the single cell distribution of the estrogen receptor-α (ER), used as a model system, can be used to measure effects of EDCs in a sensitive and reproducible manner. We used high-throughput microscopy, coupled with image analytics to measure changes in single cell ER nuclear levels on treatment with ∼100 toxicants, over a large number of biological and technical replicates. We developed a two-tiered quality control pipeline for single cell analysis and tested it against a large set of biological replicates, and toxicants from the EPA and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry lists. We also identified a subset of potentially novel EDCs that were active only on the endogenous ER level and activity as measured by single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH). We demonstrated that the distribution of ER levels per cell, and the changes upon chemical challenges were remarkably stable features; and importantly, these features could be used for quality control and identification of endocrine disruptor toxicants with high sensitivity.

We also conducted a tumorigenesis study for rats treated with PFOA and ZAL using a 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) model. Our results demonstrated that pubertal exposure to BBP, PFOA, and ZAL affected endocrine organs and serum hormones, and induced phenotypic and transcriptomic changes. The exposure to PFOA + ZAL induced the most phenotypic and transcriptomic changes in the mammary gland. PFOA + ZAL downregulated the expression of genes related to development at day 50, whereas it upregulated genes associated with tumorigenesis at day 100. PFOA + ZAL exposure also decreased rat mammary tumor latency, reduced the overall survival of rats after DMBA challenge, and affected the histopathology of mammary tumors. Therefore, our study suggests that exposure to low doses of EDCs during the pubertal period could induce changes in the endocrine system and mammary gland development in rats.

For this purpose, the external surface of the Teflon stir bar was firstly vinylized in order to immobilize a glycidyl methacrylate (GMA)-based polymer onto the magnet. Then, an amino-modified MOF of type MIL-101 (NH2-MIL-101(Al)) was covalently attached to the GMA-based monolith. After the synthesis process, several parameters affecting extraction of target estrogens by stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) including pH, ionic strength, extraction time, stirring rate, desorption solvent, and desorption time were also investigated. The resulting hybrid monolith was evaluated as SBSE sorbent for extraction of three estrogens (estrone, 17β-estradiol, estriol) and synthetic 17β-ethinylestradiol from water and human urine samples followed by HPLC with fluorescence detection (excitation and emission wavelengths, 280 and 310 nm, respectively). Under the optimal experimental conditions, the analytical figures of the method were established, achieving satisfactory limits of detection in the range of 0.015-0.58 µg L-1, recovery results ranging from 70 to 95% with RSD less than 6%, and precision values (intra- and inter-extraction units) below 6%.",PMC8821068

This study was designed to investigate the toxicological effects of BPA on hematology, serum biochemistry, and histopathology of different organs of common carp (Cyprinus carpio). A total of 60 fish were procured and haphazardly divided into four groups. Each experimental group contained 15 fish. The fish retained in group A was kept as the untreated control group. Three levels of BPA 3.0, 4.5, and 6 mg/L were given to groups B, C, and D for 30 days. Result indicated significant reduction in hemoglobin (Hb), lymphocytes, packed cell volume (PCV), red blood cells (RBC), and monocytes in a dose-dependent manner as compared to the control group. However, significantly higher values of leucocytes and neutrophils were observed in the treated groups (P < 0.05). Results on serum biochemistry revealed that the quantity of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, urea, and creatinine levels was significantly high (P < 0.05). Our study results showed significantly (P < 0.05) increase level of oxidative stress parameters like reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and lower values of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) in treated groups (4.5 mg/L and 6 mg/L)) in the brain, liver, gills, and kidneys.

Phthalates and bisphenol-A (BPA), two endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), may affect the human endocrine system. In this study, we aimed to perform a comprehensive investigation of whether growth hormone, thyroid function, and EDCs exhibited differential levels between ADHD patients and healthy controls. In total, 144 children with ADHD and 70 healthy control subjects were enrolled. Their endocrine systems were evaluated using the serum levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and Free T4. The urinary levels of EDCs, including monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and BPA, were also examined. Patients with ADHD had lower IGF-1 levels than healthy controls (p = 0.003), but we observed no significant difference in IGFBP-3, TSH, T3, T4, or Free T4. Compared to the control group, patients with ADHD demonstrated higher MEHP levels (p = 0.043), MnBP (p = 0.033), and MBzP (p = 0.040). Furthermore, MEHP levels (p < 0.001) and BPA levels (p = 0.041) were negatively correlated with IGF-1 levels, while IGF-1 levels were negatively correlated with principal components consisting of ADHD clinical symptoms and neuropsychological performance variables.

While a few legacy PFASs have been voluntarily phased out, over 5000 PFASs have been produced as replacements for their predecessors. The potential endocrine disrupting hazards of most emerging PFASs have not been comprehensively investigated. In silico molecular docking to the human androgen receptor (hAR) combined with machine learning techniques were previously applied to 5206 PFASs and predicted 23 PFASs bind the hAR. Herein, the in silico results were validated in vitro for the five candidate AR ligands that were commercially available. Three manufactured PFASs namely (9-(nonafluorobutyl)- 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1 H,5 H,11 H-pyrano[2,3-f]pyrido[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-11-one (NON), 2-(heptafluoropropyl)- 3-phenylquinoxaline (HEP), and 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoro-N-(4-nitrophenyl)pentanamide (NNN) elicited significant antiandrogenic effects at relatively low concentrations. We further investigated the mechanism of AR inhibition and found that all three PFASs inhibited AR transactivation induced by testosterone through a competitive binding mechanism. We then examined the antiandrogenic effects of these PFASs on AR expression and its responsive genes. Consistently, these PFASs significantly decreased the expression of PSA and FKBP5 and increased the expression of AR, similar to the effects elicited by a known competitive AR inhibitor, hydroxyflutamide. This suggests they are competitive antagonists of AR activity and western blot analysis revealed these PFASs decreased intracellular AR protein in androgen sensitive human prostate cancer cells. Hence, the findings presented here corroborate our published in silico approach and indicate these emerging PFASs may adversely affect the human endocrine system.",PMC9705075

It is an alternative to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a well-known reprotoxic and endocrine disruptor. As plasticizers are known to easily migrate when in contact with fatty biological fluids, patient exposure to TEHTM is highly probable. However, there is currently no data on the potential endocrine-disrupting effects of its human metabolites. To evaluate the effects of TEHTM metabolites on endocrine activity, they were first synthesized and their effects on estrogen, androgen and thyroid receptors, as well as steroid synthesis, were investigated by combining in vitro and in silico approaches. Among the primary metabolites, only 4-MEHTM (4-mono-(2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate) showed agonist activities on ERs and TRs, while three diesters were TR antagonists at non-cytotoxic concentrations. These results were completed by docking experiments which specified the ER and TR isoforms involved. A mixture of 2/1-MEHTM significantly increased the estradiol level and reduced the testosterone level in H295R cell culture supernatants. The oxidized secondary metabolites of TEHTM had no effect on ER, AR, TR receptors or on steroid hormone synthesis. Among the fourteen metabolites, these data showed that two of them (4-MEHTM and 2/1-MEHTM) induced effect on hormonal activities in vitro. However, by comparing the concentrations of the primary metabolites found in human urine with the active concentrations determined in bioassays, it can be suggested that the metabolites will not be active with regard to estrogen, androgen, thyroid receptors and steroidogenesis-mediated effects.",7916494

Steroid sex hormones are detected in corals and sea anemones even though these animals do not have estrogen receptors and their repertoire of steroidogenic enzymes appears to be incomplete. Pathways associated with sex hormone biosynthesis and sterol signaling are an understudied area in cnidarian biology. The objective of this study was to identify a suite of genes that can be linked to exposure of endocrine disruptors. Exaiptasia diaphana were exposed to nominal 20ppb concentrations of estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), cholesterol, oxybenzone (BP-3), or benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) for 4 h. Eleven genes of interest (GOIs) were chosen from a previously generated EST library. The GOIs are 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases type 14 (17β HSD14) and type 12 (17β HSD12), Niemann-Pick C type 2 (NPC2), Equistatin (EI), Complement component C3 (C3), Cathepsin L (CTSL), Patched domain-containing protein 3 (PTCH3), Smoothened (SMO), Desert Hedgehog (DHH), Zinc finger protein GLI2 (GLI2), and Vitellogenin (VTG). These GOIs were selected because of functional associations with steroid hormone biosynthesis; cholesterol binding/transport; immunity; phagocytosis; or Hedgehog signaling. Quantitative Real-Time PCR quantified expression of GOIs. In silico modelling utilized protein structures from Protein Data Bank as well as creating protein structures with SWISS-MODEL. Results show transcription of steroidogenic enzymes, and cholesterol binding/transport proteins have similar transcription profiles for E2, T, and cholesterol treatments, but different profiles when BP-3 or BBP is present. C3 expression can differentiate between exposures to BP-3 versus BBP as well as exposure to cholesterol versus sex hormones. In silico modelling revealed all ligands (E2, T, cholesterol, BBP, and BP-3) have favorable binding affinities with 17β HSD14, 17β HSD12, NPC2, SMO, and PTCH proteins. VTG expression was down-regulated in the sterol treatments but up-regulated in BP-3 and BBP treatments. In summary, these eleven GOIs collectively generate unique transcriptional profiles capable of discriminating between the five chemical exposures used in this investigation. This suite of GOIs are candidate biomarkers for detecting transcriptional changes in steroidogenesis, gametogenesis, sterol transport, and Hedgehog signaling.

Under the same conditions, it significantly increased metabolic rates and the energetic cost of growth across development. By contrast, BPA decreased the cost of growth at cooler temperatures (24°C). BPA-mediated changes in cost of growth were not associated with mitochondrial efficiency (P/O ratios (i.e. adenosine diphosphate (ADP) used/oxygen consumed) and respiratory control ratios) although BPA did increase mitochondrial proton leak. In females, BPA decreased age at maturity at 24°C but increased it at 30°C, and it decreased the gonadosomatic index suggesting reduced investment into reproduction.

These emerging substances are endocrine disruptors associated with obesity, type II diabetes (TD2M) and myocardial infarction. ClxBPA are present in different human biological matrices but their toxicokinetics remain unknown. The aim of this study was to measure and compare the metabolic kinetics in the liver of four ClxBPA (ClBPA, Cl2BPA, Cl3BPA and Cl4BPA) between compounds and between species (Sprague-Dawley rats vs humans). To estimate their metabolic constants (Vmax, Km, Intrinsic clearance), metabolic assays were performed in hepatocyte suspensions. Assays revealed that metabolic constants of ClxBPA can greatly vary depending on substances and species. While ClBPA and Cl2BPA show similar unbound intrinsic clearances (ClintU) in rat incubation media, values for Cl3BPA and Cl4BPA are very different (3.109 and 0.684 mL/min/106 hepatocytes, respectively). Unlike in rats, human results are quite different as Cl3BPA and Cl4BPA have similar unbound intrinsic clearances, while ClBPA and Cl2BPA diverge (0.350 and 1.363 mL/min/106 hepatocytes, respectively). In both species, Cl2BPA and Cl3BPA have relatively similar clearances, and ClBPA is very different from Cl4BPA. Although we quantified the proportion of sulfo- and glucurono-metabolites, other metabolites may have been formed (e.g., glutathione, disulfate, or oxidative metabolites).

Although direct and ancestral exposures can each lead to deficits in behaviors, their interactions are not known. Here we focused on social behaviors based on evidence of their vulnerability to direct or ancestral exposures, together with their importance in reproduction and survival of a species. Using a novel ""two hits, three generations apart"" experimental rat model, we investigated interactions of two classes of EDCs across six generations. PCBs (a weakly estrogenic mixture Aroclor 1221, 1 mg/kg), Vinclozolin (antiandrogenic, 1 mg/kg) or vehicle (6% DMSO in sesame oil) were administered to pregnant rat dams (F0) to directly expose the F1 generation, with subsequent breeding through paternal or maternal lines. A second EDC hit was given to F3 dams, thereby exposing the F4 generation, with breeding through the F6 generation. Approximately 1200 male and female rats from F1, F3, F4 and F6 generations were run through tests of sociability and social novelty as indices of social preference. We leveraged machine learning using DeepLabCut to analyze nuanced social behaviors such as nose touching with accuracy similar to a human scorer. Surprisingly, social behaviors were affected in ancestrally exposed but not directly exposed individuals, particularly females from a paternally exposed breeding lineage. Effects varied by EDC: Vinclozolin affected aspects of behavior in the F3 generation while PCBs affected both the F3 and F6 generations. Taken together, our data suggest that specific aspects of behavior are particularly vulnerable to heritable ancestral exposure of EDC contamination, that there are sex differences, and that lineage is a key factor in transgenerational outcomes.",PMC8779176

However, how BPA exposure results in these disorders remains uncertain. Hence, we have herein summarized the reported impacts of BPA on the morphology and metabolic state of the placenta and have proposed mechanisms by which BPA affects placentation, potentially leading to obstetric complications. Current findings suggest that BPA induces pathological changes in the placenta and disrupts its metabolic activities. Based on exposure concentrations, BPA can elicit apoptotic or anti-apoptotic signals in the trophoblasts, and can exaggerate trophoblast fusion while inhibiting trophoblast migration and invasion to affect pregnancy. Accordingly, the usage of BPA products by pregnant women should be minimized and less harmful alternative chemicals should be explored and employed where possible.",PMC9113501

The concentration of six different parabens, seven phenols, 31 metabolites from 15 phthalate diesters and the polychlorinated substance triclocarban were analyzed by isotope diluted TurboFlow-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of all included compounds were highest in maternal urine followed by serum, and lowest in amniotic fluid. Of the six parabens measured in amniotic fluid, methylparaben (MeP) and ethylparaben (EtP) were detectable most often (87% and 33% of the samples, respectively).

To assess mediating effects of hormone concentrations on associations between phthalate mixtures and preterm birth (PTB). Repeated urinary phthalates and serum hormones were measured among 1011 women in the PROTECT Puerto Rico birth cohort from 2011-2019. We utilized ridge regression to create phthalate environmental risk scores (ERS), which represent weighted summaries of total phthalate exposure. Mediation analyses were conducted on a subset of 705 women. We additionally conducted fetal sex-specific analyses. Free thyroxine (FT4) mediated 9.6% of the association between high molecular weight (HMW) ERS at 18 weeks and reduced gestational age at delivery (95%CI:1.07-29.9). Progesterone at 26 weeks mediated 21.1% and 16.2% of the association between HMW ERS at 18 and 22 weeks, and spontaneous PTB, respectively. Among male fetuses, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) at 18 weeks mediated 28.2% of the association between low molecular weight ERS and spontaneous PTB.

We also show differences by fetal sex, but larger sample size is necessary to validate our findings. This study provides introductory evidence that an alteration of hormone concentrations occurs on the causal pathway between gestational phthalate mixture exposure and subsequent PTB. In addition to the novel application of repeated biomarker measurements and mixtures methods in causal mediation analyses, we also explored differences between classes of phthalate compounds and between fetal sexes.

We employed zebrafish larva (transgenic SR4G line) with a cortisol-inducible green fluorescence protein reporter (eGFP) as a model to detect stress responses upon exposure to compounds with environmental impact, including bisphenol A (BPA), vinclozolin (VIN), and fluoxetine (FLX). Cortisol, fluorescence signal, and mRNA levels of eGFP and 11 targeted genes were measured in a homogenized pool of zebrafish larvae, with six experimental replicates for each endpoint. Eleven targeted genes were selected according to their association with stress-axis and immediate early response class of genes. Hydrocortisone (CORT)and dexamethasone (DEX) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. All measurements were done in two unstressed and stressed condition using standardized net handling as the stressor. A significant positive linear correlation between cortisol levels and eGFP mRNA levels was observed (r> 0.9). Based on eGFP mRNA levels in unstressed and stressed larvae two predictive models were trained (Random Forest and Logistic Regression). Both these models could correctly predict the blunted stress response upon exposure to BPA, VIN, FLX and the negative control, DEX. The negative predictive value (NPV) of these models were 100%. Similar NPV was observed when the predictive models trained based on the mRNA levels of the eleven assessed genes. Measurement of whole-body fluorescence intensity signal was not significant to detect blunted stress response.

However, the underlying mechanisms for this association are unclear. Many EDCs have been shown to function as ligands of the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR), which functions as xenobiotic sensor but also has pro-atherogenic effects in vivo. We sought to investigate the contribution of PXR to the adverse effects dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), a widely used phthalate plasticizer, on lipid homeostasis and CVD risk factors. Cell-based assays, primary organoid cultures, and PXR conditional knockout and PXR-humanized mouse models were used to investigate the impact of DCHP exposure on PXR activation and lipid homeostasis in vitro and in vivo. Targeted lipidomics were performed to measure circulating ceramides, novel predictors for CVD. DCHP was identified as a potent PXR-selective agonist that led to higher plasma cholesterol levels in wild-type mice. DCHP was then demonstrated to activate intestinal PXR to elicit hyperlipidemia by using tissue-specific PXR-deficient mice. Interestingly, DCHP exposure also led to higher circulating ceramides in a PXR-dependent manner. DCHP-mediated PXR activation stimulated the expression of intestinal genes mediating lipogenesis and ceramide synthesis. Given that PXR exhibits considerable species-specific differences in receptor pharmacology, PXR-humanized mice were also used to replicate these findings. Although the adverse health effects of several well-known phthalates have attracted considerable attention, little is known about the potential impact of DCHP on human health. Our studies demonstrate that DCHP activated PXR to induce hypercholesterolemia and ceramide production in mice. These results indicate a potentially important role of PXR in contributing to the deleterious effects of plastic-associated EDCs on cardiovascular health in humans.

The data of 300 infertile patients with fresh IVF-ET cycles were analyzed. The level of BPA in the blood and follicular fluid was determined by HPLC-MRM-MS/MS. Determination of genotypes of the detoxification system genes was carried out by the real-time PCR. The threshold level for determining BPA was 0.1 ng/mL. BPA was detected in 92.3% (277/300) blood and in 16.8% (49/292) follicular fluid (FF) samples. There was no correlation between BPA level in the blood and FF. In patients with the absence of the A allele of the SULT1A1 gene, BPA was detected in FF significantly more often (22.6% vs. 13.5%, p = 0.0341). There was an association (not statistically significant) between the level of BPA in the blood and the presence of the G allele of the GSTP1 gene (rs1695) and the C allele in the GSTP1 gene (rs1138272). Our data suggests the role of detoxification system genes in the metabolism of BPA in the human body.

Estrogen is a primary hormonal regulator of skeletal growth and development; however, the impact of gestational BPA or BPS exposure on skeletal health of offspring remains relatively unknown. Here, adult female mice were randomized into three treatment groups: 200 μg BPA/kg BW (BPA), 200 μg BPS/kg BW (BPS) or control (CON). Animals were then further randomized to exercising (EX) or sedentary (SED) groups. Treatment continued through mating, gestation, and lactation. One male offspring from each dam (n = 6-8/group) was assessed at 16 weeks of age to evaluate effects of EDC exposure on the adult skeleton. Cortical geometry of the mid-diaphysis and trabecular microarchitecture of the distal femur were assessed via micro-CT. Biomechanical strength and mineral apposition rate of the femoral diaphysis were assessed via three-point bending and dynamic histomorphometry, respectively. Two-factor ANOVA or ANCOVA were used to determine the effects of maternal EX and BPA or BPS on trabecular and cortical bone outcomes. Maternal EX led to a significant decrease in body fat percentage and bone stiffness, independent of EDC exposure. Offspring exposed to BPA had significantly lower trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, connectivity density, cortical thickness, and greater trabecular spacing compared to BPS or CON animals. In conclusion, gestational BPA, but not BPS, exposure negatively impacted trabecular microarchitecture and cortical geometry in adult male offspring.

Among these endocrine disrupting substances, Bisphenol A (BPA), a widely used compound, is known to negatively impact germ and somatic cells in the testis. Physical agents, such as ionizing radiation, were also described to perturb spermatogenesis. Despite the fact that we are constantly exposed to numerous environmental chemical and physical compounds, very few studies explore the impact of combined exposure to chemical and physical pollutants on reproductive health. The aim of this study was to describe the impact of fetal co-exposure to BPA and IR on testicular function in mice. We exposed pregnant mice to 10 µM BPA (corresponding to 0.5 mg/kg/day) in drinking water from 10.5 dpc until birth, and we irradiated mice with 0.2 Gy (γ-ray, RAD) at 12.5 days post-conception. Co-exposure to BPA and γ-ray induces DNA damage in fetal germ cells in an additive manner, leading to a long-lasting decrease in germ cell abundance. We also observed significant alteration of adult steroidogenesis by RAD exposure independently of the BPA exposure. This is illustrated by the downregulation of steroidogenic genes and the decrease of the number of adult Leydig cells. As a consequence, courtship behavior is modified, and male ultrasonic vocalizations associated with courtship decreased. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the importance of broadening the concept of endocrine disruptors to include physical agents, leading to a reevaluation of risk management and regulatory decisions.",PMC8584123

Objective: To summarize the evidence of associations between environmental risk factors and the risk of endometriosis. Methods: Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrial.gov were systematically searched in June 2020. Meta-analyses of observational studies investigated any environmental exposure (non-genetic) and endometriosis risk. For each article, we estimated the summary effect size, 95% CIs, and the 95% prediction interval (PI). We also estimated the between-study heterogeneity expressed by I 2, evidence for small-study effects, and evidence of excess significance bias. Results: About 12 eligible articles (featuring 143,422 cases and 5,112,967 participants) yielded data on 40 unique environmental risk factors, including life styles (n = 16), reproductive factors (n = 3), early life factors (n = 4), and a range of other risk factors [e.g., phthalate metabolites, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and body mass index (BMI)]. About 25 of these 40 associations (62.5%) were statistically significant (p < 0.05) under random-effects models. Evidence for an association was indicated for alcohol intake [relative risk (RR): 1.25; 95% CI: 1.11-1.41] and the exposure to endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) (RR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.23-1.60) while 15 associations presented only weak evidence. Conclusions: Our analyses showed that alcohol intake and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be potential risk factors for endometriosis and supported by suggestive epidemiological evidence.

Exposure to BPA is especially dangerous if it occurs during specific ""critical periods"" of life, when organisms are more sensitive to hormonal changes (i.e., intrauterine, perinatal, juvenile or puberty periods). In this study, we focused on the effects of chronic exposure to BPA in adult female mice starting during pregnancy. Three months old C57BL/6J females were orally exposed to BPA or to vehicle (corn oil). The treatment (4 µg/kg body weight/day) started the day 0 of pregnancy and continued throughout pregnancy, lactation, and lasted for a total of 20 weeks. BPA-treated dams did not show differences in body weight or food intake, but they showed an altered estrous cycle compared to the controls. In order to evidence alterations in social and sociosexual behaviors, we performed the Three-Chamber test for sociability, and analyzed two hypothalamic circuits (well-known targets of endocrine disruption) particularly involved in the control of social behavior: the vasopressin and the oxytocin systems. The test revealed some alterations in the displaying of social behavior: BPA-treated dams have higher locomotor activity compared to the control dams, probably a signal of high level of anxiety. In addition, BPA-treated dams spent more time interacting with no-tester females than with no-tester males. In brain sections, we observed a decrease of vasopressin immunoreactivity (only in the paraventricular and suprachiasmatic nuclei) of BPA-treated females, while we did not find any alteration of the oxytocin system. In parallel, we have also observed, in the same hypothalamic nuclei, a significant reduction of the membrane estrogen receptor GPER1 expression.",PMC8607277

At 10.5 weeks, the animals were sacrificed to conduct histological examinations. BPA-exposed mice were found to have neurobehavioral abnormalities, heart, kidney, and lung diseases with increased apoptotic indices in both sexes. On the other hand, the treatment of BPA mice with VitD altered this scenario with modulated motor activity, enhanced body and organ weights, and preserved the heart, kidney, and lung architecture, alongside a decreased percent apoptotic index.

We analyzed the physiological impact of the EDC, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and found that its metabolite, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), had significant adverse effects on myeloid hematopoiesis at environmentally relevant concentrations. An analysis of the underlying mechanism revealed that MEHP promotes increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) by reducing the activity of superoxide dismutase in all lineages, possibly via its actions at the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This leads to a metabolic shift away from glycolysis toward the pentose phosphate pathway and ultimately results in the death of hematopoietic cells that rely on glycolysis for energy production. By contrast, cells that utilize fatty acid oxidation for energy production are not susceptible to this outcome due to their capacity to uncouple ATP production. These responses were also detected in non-hematopoietic cells exposed to alternate inducers of ROS.",PMC8534767

Gestationally exposed F1-generation offspring from different litters were mated to produce F2 offspring, and similarly, F2-generation animals produced F3-generation offspring. One group of F3 male offspring was administered either testosterone plus estradiol-17β (T + E2) or sham via capsule implants from postnatal days 70 to 210. Another group was naturally aged to 18 months. Combination diets of HFB + BPA in F0 dams, but not single exposure to either, disrupted spermatogenesis in F3-generation adult males in both the T + E2-implanted group and the naturally aged group. CYP19A1 localization to the acrosome and estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) localization to the nucleus were associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Finally, expression of methyl-CpG-binding domain-3 (MBD3) was consistently decreased in the HFB and HFB + BPA exposed F1 and F3 testes, suggesting an epigenetic component to this inheritance. However, the severe atrophy within testes present in F1 males was absent in F3 males.

The adverse health outcomes deriving from phthalate exposure have been associated with their activity as endocrine disruptors (EDCs) of the steroid and thyroid hormone signaling by affecting developmental and reproductive health, and even carcinogenicity. However, the estrogen disruptor activities of DEP are still controversial, and the mechanism at the root of the estrogenic-disrupting action of DEP remains to be clarified. Here, we evaluated the DEP mechanism of action on the activation status of estrogen receptor α (ERα) by analyzing the receptor's phosphorylation as well as both nuclear and extra-nuclear pathways triggered by the receptor to modulate the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Although DEP does not bind to ERα, our results suggest that this phthalate ester exerts multiple parallel interactions with ERα signaling and emphasize the importance to determine an appropriate battery of in vitro methods that will include specific molecular mechanisms involved in the endocrine disruption.",PMC8538674

In this study, fifteen PAEs were analyzed in six categories of bottled drinks (n = 105) collected from the Chinese market, including mineral water, tea drinks, energy drinks, juice drinks, soft drinks, and beer. Among the 15 PAEs measured, DEHP was the most abundant phthalate with concentrations ranging from below the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 41,000 ng/L at a detection rate (DR) of 96%, followed by DIBP (DR: 88%) and DBP (DR: 84%) with respective concentration ranges of below LOQ to 16,000 and to 4900 ng/L. At least one PAE was detected in each drink sample, and the sum concentrations of 15 PAEs ranged from 770 to 48,004 ng/L (median: 6286 ng/L). Significant differences with respect to both PAE concentrations and composition profiles were observed between different types of bottled drinks. The median sum concentration of 15 PAEs in soft drinks was over five times higher than that detected in mineral water; different from other drink types. Besides DEHP, DBIP, and DBP, a high concentration of BMEP was also detected in a tea drink.

We have previously demonstrated that RACK1 expression can serve as a marker for evaluation of immunotoxic profiles of hormone-active substances, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In this study, we investigated the effects of three bisphenols (BPA, BPAF, BPS) on RACK1 expression and on the innate immune responses in the THP-1 human promyelocytic cell line, a validated model for this investigation. BPA and BPAF reduced RACK1 promoter transcriptional activity, mRNA expression, and protein levels. However, BPS had the opposite effect. As expected, these results on RACK1 were paralleled by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) production. Since BPA and BPAF induced RACK1 expression in the presence of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone, a role of G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has been considered due to their known estrogenic profile. Therefore, additional molecular effects of BPA and BPAF were unmasked after treatment with different inhibitors of well-known pivotal players of GPER-mediated signaling. BPA exerted its effects on RACK1 via NF-κB, as shown using the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11-7085 and NF-κB-specific luciferase reporter assay. Conversely, BPAF induced RACK1 up-regulation via androgen receptor (AR) activation, as confirmed by treatment with AR antagonist flutamide. Indeed, a biased agonism profile for BPA and BPAF for GPER was suggested based on their different binding modes revealed by our molecular docking. Altogether, our data suggest that RACK1 could represent an important target of EDCs and serves as a screening tool for their immunotoxic potential.

The median maternal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was 2.66 (0.70-8.23) μIU/ml, the median maternal free thyroxine (FT4) level was 12.44 (11.27-13.53) μg/dL, the median maternal thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab) level was 9.6 (7.36-12.51) IU/mL. Newborns' median total thyroxine (T4) level was 14.8 (7.6-24.9) μg/dL. No association was found between exposure to different congeners or to ∑PCBs and maternal TSH, FT4, thyroglobulin autoantibodies (Tg Ab), TPO Ab and newborn total T4 levels. In multivariable analysis a 1% change in ∑PCBs level was significantly associated with a 0.57% change in maternal TSH levels in women with body mass index (BMI) < 19. The same association was observed for each of the studied PCB congeners. Maternal TPO Ab levels statistically significantly increased by 0.53 and 0.46% for 1% increase in PCB 118 and 153 congeners, respectively. In women with BMI > 25, the association between the PCBs levels and maternal TSH levels was in the opposite direction. No association was found in women with normal BMI (19-24.9). Conclusions: Background exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of some PCBs can alter thyroid hormone homeostasis in pregnant women and might be associated with abnormal TSH levels and TPO-Ab in women with low BMI. However, these findings require further investigation.",PMC8473683

Considerable attention has been paid to their biological effects especially in women of childbearing age or during pregnancy as EDCs have been reported to cross the placenta becoming concentrated in the fetus' circulation. Lifestyle habits, daily consumption of packaged foods and use of healthcare/cosmetic products are associated with increased EDCs levels. This cross-sectional research examined the EDCs levels and the lifestyle determinants of EDC exposure in a cohort of reproductive-age women from Northern Italy. Methods: Forty-five women (median age: 36, IQR: 30-38) were evaluated for urinary bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates levels and also studied for EDCs' major determinants of daily exposure; food frequency/dietary, physical activity, smoking habits and weight status. Results: Although 100% of women seemed to have been exposed to common sources of EDCs, they reported a healthy lifestyle. The multivariable model described a positive and significant association between consumption of sauces/dressings in plastic containers and monoethyl phthalate exposure (p = 0.037). Conclusions: Since reproductive age encompasses a critical window for future health and functioning of the ""mothers-to-be"" and their children, future studies on prenatal dietary BPA and phthalate exposure and the role of consumer product choices in reducing such exposure are recommended.",PMC8469822

Several studies have indicated a correlation between POPs and metabolic diseases; however, their effects on mitochondria as a central organelle in cellular metabolism and the usage of mitochondria as functional markers for metabolic disease are barely understood. In this study, a zebrafish model system was exposed to two subclasses of POPs, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), under two different conditions (solitary OCPs or OCPs with PCBs (Aroclor 1254)), and changes in the oxidative stress marker levels and mitochondrial enzyme activities in the electron transport chain of the tail were measured to observe the correlation between POPs and representative biomarkers for metabolic disease. The results indicated different responses upon exposure to OCPs and OCPs with Aroclor 1254, and accelerated toxicity was observed following exposure to mixed POPs (OCPs with Aroclor 1254). Males were more sensitive to changes in the levels of oxidative stress markers induced by POP exposure, whereas females were more susceptible to the toxic effects of POPs on the levels of mitochondrial activity markers. These results demonstrate that the study reflects real environmental conditions, with low-dose and multiple-toxin exposure for a long period, and that POPs alter major mitochondrial enzymes' functions with an imbalance of redox homeostasis in a sex-dependent manner.",PMC8469042

Urine and breast adipose tissue samples from 41 breast cancer mastectomy and 11 mammoplasty patients were taken. BPA concentrations were detected using an ELISA assay. Urinary BPA concentrations were significantly higher in cancerous patients (2.12 ± 1.48 ng/ml; P < 0.01) compared to non-cancerous (0.91 ± 0.42 ng/ml). Likewise, tissue BPA concentrations in cancerous patients (4.20 ± 2.40 ng/g tissue; P < 0.01) were significantly higher than non- cancerous (1.80 ± 1.05 ng/g tissue). Urinary BPA concentrations were positively correlated with breast adipose tissue BPA in the case group (P < 0.001, R = 0.896).

Exposure-associated changes of DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns have been suggested as a possible mediator of this relationship. This study investigated whether prenatal low-dose exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) is associated with altered DNAm patterns across the genome in a Western urban-industrial population. In 142 mother-infant pairs from the Duisburg Birth Cohort Study, PCBs and PCDD/Fs levels were quantified from maternal blood during late pregnancy and associated with DNAm levels in cord blood using the Illumina EPIC beadchip. The epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) identified 32 significantly differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and eight differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with six congeners of PCB and PCDD in females or males (FDRs < 0.05). DMPs and DMRs mapped to genes involved in neurodevelopment, gene regulation, and immune functioning. Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) showed 31 co-methylated modules (FDRs < 0.05) associated with one congener of PCDF levels in females. Results of both analytical strategies indicate that prenatal exposure to PCBs and PCDD/Fs is associated with altered DNAm of genes involved in neurodevelopment, gene expression and immune functioning. DNAm and gene expression levels of several of these genes were previously associated with EDC exposure in rodent models. Follow-up studies will clarify whether these epigenetic changes might contribute to the origin for adverse mental and health outcomes.",PMC9487754
34505931,Andreas Natsch,Scientific discrepancies in European regulatory proposals on endocrine disruptors-REACH regulation quo vadis?,2021,"The EU chemical strategy for sustainability places a high focus on endocrine-disrupting chemicals (ED), the importance of their identification with increased testing and a ban in consumer products by a generic approach. It is assumed that for ED no threshold and hence no safe dose exists, leading to this generic approach. This view appears to be linked to the claim that for ED 'low-dose non-monotonic dose response' (low-dose NMDR) effects are observed. Without this hypothesis, there are no scientific reasons why classical risk assessment cannot be applied to the ED mode-of-action. Thus, whether for ED low-dose NMDR effects are considered a reproducible scientific fact by European authorities is Gretchen's question in this politicized field. Recent documents by the SCCS, EFSA and ECHA reviewed herein illustrate the diverging views within European scientific bodies on this issue. Furthermore, ED researchers never replicated findings on low-dose NMDR in blinded inter-laboratory experiments and the CLARITY-BPA core studies could not find evidence for reproducible NMDR for BPA. ECHA proposes a battery of in vitro tests to test all chemicals for ED properties. However, these tests were never validated for relevance and their high positivity rate could lead to increased follow-up animal testing. Based on (i) lack of reproducibility data for low-dose NMDR, (ii) diverging views within European authorities on NMDR and (iii) lack of fully validated in vitro test methods it might be premature to fast-track the wide-ranging changes in the regulatory landscape proposed by the authorities ultimately leading to drastically increased animal testing.",PMC8492591

So far, BPA toxicity has been largely investigated on different biological processes, from reproduction to development, immune system, and metabolism. In zebrafish, Danio rerio, previous studies revealed the ability of environmentally relevant concentrations of this contaminant to significantly impair fertility via epigenetic modification. In addition, several studies demonstrated the ability of different probiotic strains to improve organism health. This study provides information on the role of the probiotic mixture SLAb51 to counteract adverse BPA effects on reproduction. A 28-day trial was set up with different experimental groups: BPA, exposed to 10 µg/L BPA; P, receiving a dietary supplementation of SLAb51 at a final concentration of 109 CFU/g; BPA+P exposed to 10 µg/L BPA and receiving SLAb51 at a final concentration of 109 CFU/g and a C group. Since oocyte growth and maturation represent key aspects for fertility in females, studies were performed on isolated class III (vitellogenic) and IV (in maturation) follicles and liver, with emphasis on the modulation of the different vitellogenin isoforms. In males, key signals regulating spermatogenesis were investigated. Results demonstrated that in fish exposed to the combination of BPA and probiotic, most of the transcripts were closer to C or P levels, supporting the hypothesis of SLAb51 to antagonize BPA toxicity. This study represents the first evidence related to the use of SLAb51 to improve reproduction and open new fields of investigation regarding its use to reduce endocrine disrupting compound impacts on health.",PMC8430984

Multivariable logistic regression model, weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were implemented to analyze the combined effect of chemicals on the overall association with UL and EM. In single chemical analysis, equol (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.27) and mercury (Hg) (OR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.25) were found positively associated with UL in tertile 3 vs. tertile 1. In WQS regression and BKMR models, the significant positive association between WQS index and UL (OR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.52, 4.29) was identified and the positive relationship between equol and Hg exposure and UL were further verified. Besides, the mixture evaluation models (WQS and BKMR) also found MEHP negatively associated with UL. Although none of the single chemicals in tertile 3 were significantly associated with EM, the WQS index had a marginally positive association with EM (OR: 2.01, 95% CI: 0.98, 4.15), and a significant positive association was identified in subanalysis with participants restricted to premenopausal women (OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.70).

While excessive caloric intake, physical inactivity, and genetic susceptibility are undoubted contributors to diabetes risk, these factors alone fail to fully explain the rapid global rise in diabetes rates. Recently, environmental contaminants acting as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes. Indeed, burgeoning data from cell-based, animal, population, and even clinical studies now indicate that a variety of structurally distinct EDCs of both natural and synthetic origin have the capacity to alter insulin secretion and action as well as global glucose homeostasis.

This special type of polymer was obtained for the recognition and determination of trace bisphenol A (BPA) in aqueous media. Two types of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) were synthesized using amounts of BPA of 5 wt.% (MIP-2) and 7 wt.% (MIP-1) in the reaction mixtures. Additionally, a non-imprinted polymer (NIP) was also synthesized. Polymer MIP-2 showed thermocontrolled recognition for imprinted molecules and a higher binding capacity than its corresponding non-imprinted polymer and higher than other molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP-1). The best condition for the sorption process was at a temperature of 35 °C, that is, at a temperature close to the phase transition value for poly(N-isopropylacrylamide). Under these conditions, the highest levels of BPA removal from water were achieved and the highest adsorption capacity of MIP-2 was about 0.5 mmol g-1 (about 114.1 mg g-1) and was approximately 20% higher than for MIP-1 and NIP.

As an alternative, we developed a human cell-based dimerization assay for detecting EDC-mediated ER-alpha (ERα) dimerization using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). The resultant novel BRET-based on the ERα dimerization assay was used to identify the binding affinity of 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-estradiol, corticosterone, diethylhexyl phthalate, bisphenol A, and 4-nonylphenol with ERα by measuring the corresponding BRET signals. Consequently, the BRET signals from five chemicals except corticosterone showed a dose-dependent sigmoidal curve for ERα, and these chemicals were suggested as positive chemicals for ERα. In contrast, corticosterone, which induced a BRET signal comparable to that of the vehicle control, was suggested as a negative chemical for ERα. Therefore, these results were consistent with the results of the existing binding assay for ERα and suggested that a novel BRET system can provide information about EDCs-mediated dimerization to ERα.",PMC8395052

We previously demonstrated that chronic exposure of ovariectomized C57Bl6/J mice fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet to a low-dose mixture of chemicals with one dioxin, one polychlorobiphenyl, one phthalate, and bisphenol A triggered metabolic alterations in the liver but the intestine was not explored. Yet, the gastrointestinal tract is the main route by which pollutants enter the body. In the present study, we investigated the metabolic consequences of ovarian withdrawal and E2 replacement on the various gut segments along with investigating the impact of the mixture of pollutants. We showed that genes encoding estrogen receptors (Esr1, Gper1 not Esr2), xenobiotic processing genes (e.g., Cyp3a11, Cyp2b10), and genes related to gut homeostasis in the jejunum (e.g., Cd36, Got2, Mmp7) and to bile acid biosynthesis in the gut (e.g., Fgf15, Slc10a2) and liver (e.g., Abcb11, Slc10a1) were under estrogen regulation. Exposure to pollutants mimicked some of the effects of E2 replacement, particularly in the ileum (e.g., Esr1, Nr1c1) suggesting that the mixture had estrogen-mimetic activities.

Here, we highlight the need for validated assays that detect non-EATS modalities and discuss major international efforts underway to develop such tools for regulatory purposes, focusing on non-EATS modalities of high concern (i.e., retinoic acid, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, and glucocorticoid signaling). Two case studies are presented with strong evidence amongst animals and human studies for non-EATS disruption and associations with wildlife and human disease. This includes metabolic syndrome and insulin signaling (case study 1) and chemicals that impact the cardiovascular system (case study 2). This is relevant as obesity and cardiovascular disease represent two of the most significant health-related crises of our time. Lastly, emerging topics related to EDCs are discussed, including recognition of crosstalk between the EATS and non-EATS axis, complex mixtures containing a variety of EDCs, adverse outcome pathways for chemicals acting through non-EATS mechanisms, and novel models for testing chemicals. Recommendations and considerations for evaluating non-EATS modalities are proposed. Moving forward, improved understanding of the non-EATS modalities will lead to integrated testing strategies that can be used in regulatory bodies to protect environmental, animal, and human health from harmful environmental chemicals.",PMC8669078

A number of in vitro screening studies have evaluated the estrogenic potential of BS with ambiguous results. Lack of dose-response information for the positive control 17β-estradiol (E2) in most studies makes an assessment of the relative potency and efficacy challenging. Notwithstanding this difficulty, BS has been added as the only fragrance ingredient to the list of the first 14 substances to be screened as potential endocrine disruptors by the European Scientific Committee for Consumer Safety (SCCS) and it is included in the Community rolling action plan (CoRAP) of the European REACH regulation to be assessed for the same property. Here we review all literature evidence and present new data to quantify the in vitro potency and efficacy of BS vs. E2 with full dose response analysis in both an estrogen response element (ERE) depending reporter gene assay and in the MCF7 cell proliferation (E-screen) assay. In both assays, very similar results for BS were found. BS is a partial agonist exhibiting 35-47 % maximal efficacy and it is active only close to the cytotoxic concentration. The extrapolated concentration to achieve 50 % efficacy is 21'000'000 higher as compared to E2 in the reporter gene assay. A ca. 36'000'000 higher concentration of BS as compared to E2 is required to reach equivalent partial cell proliferation stimulation in the MCF7 proliferation assay. This potency is significantly below the agonistic activity of known chemicals which cause estrogenic effects in in vivo assays. Importantly, in this study the weak agonistic activity is for the first time directly related to the activity of E2 in a full quantitative comparison in human cell lines which may help ongoing evaluations of BS by regulatory bodies.",PMC8363597

We designed a case-cohort study within the EPIC-Spain cohort. Study population consisted on 4812 participants from 4 EPIC-Spain centers (547 breast cancer cases, 575 prostate cancer cases and 3690 sub-cohort participants). BPA exposure was assessed by means of chemical analyses of serum samples collected at recruitment. Borgan II weighted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios. Median follow-up time in our study was 16.9 years. BPA geometric mean serum values of cases and sub-cohort were 1.12 ng/ml vs 1.10 ng/ml respectively for breast cancer and 1.33 ng/ml vs 1.29 ng/ml respectively for prostate cancer. When categorizing BPA into tertiles, a 40% increase in risk of prostate cancer for tertile 1 (p = 0.022), 37% increase for tertile 2 (p = 0.034) and 31% increase for tertile 3 (p = 0.072) was observed with respect to values bellow the limit of detection. No significant association was observed between BPA levels and breast cancer risk. We found a similar percentage of detection of BPA among cases and sub-cohort from our population, and no association with breast cancer risk was observed.

Although the neuroendocrine control of sexual maturation is a major target of EDCs, little is known about the potential role of the hypothalamus in puberty and ovulation disruption transmitted across generations. We hypothesized that developmental exposure to an environmentally relevant dose of EDC mixture could induce multi- and/or transgenerational alterations of sexual maturation and maternal care in female rats through epigenetic reprograming of the hypothalamus. We investigated the transmission of a disrupted reproductive phenotype via the maternal germline or via nongenomic mechanisms involving maternal care. Adult female Wistar rats were exposed prior to and during gestation and until the end of lactation to a mixture of the following 13 EDCs: di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), bisphenol A (BPA), vinclozolin, prochloraz, procymidone, linuron, epoxynaxole, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, octyl methoxynimmate, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), butylparaben, and acetaminophen. Perinatally exposed offspring (F1) were mated with unexposed males to generate germ cell (F2) and transgenerationally exposed (F3 and F4) females. Sexual maturation, maternal behavior, and hypothalamic targets of exposure were studied across generations. Germ cell (F2) and transgenerationally (F3) EDC-exposed females, but not F1, displayed delayed pubertal onset and altered folliculogenesis. We reported a transgenerational alteration of key hypothalamic genes controlling puberty and ovulation (Kiss1, Esr1, and Oxt), and we identified the hypothalamic polycomb group of epigenetic repressors as actors of this mechanism. Furthermore, we found a multigenerational reduction of maternal behavior (F1-F3) induced by a loss in hypothalamic dopaminergic signaling. Using a cross-fostering paradigm, we identified that the reduction in maternal phenotype was normalized in EDC-exposed pups raised by unexposed dams, but no reversal of the pubertal phenotype was achieved. Rats developmentally exposed to an EDC mixture exhibited multi- and transgenerational disruption of sexual maturation and maternal care via hypothalamic epigenetic reprogramming. These results raise concerns about the impact of EDC mixtures on future generations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8795.",PMC8360047

A total of 25 articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. Eleven of them failed to show a clear relationship between BPA and abnormal fetal growth. The majority of the remaining studies (9/14) found an inverse association of BPA with indicators of fetal growth, whereas three studies suggested increased fetal growth, and two studies produced contradictory findings. Of note, both of the studies that collected a sample (amniotic fluid) directly reflecting BPA concentration in the fetus during the first half of pregnancy revealed an inverse association with birth weight.

Animal studies indicate that BPA may play a role in the process of reproduction and impact on maturing oocytes, meiotic cell division or fertilization rate. Nevertheless, data regarding the effects of exposure to BPA on women's ovarian function are still limited. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess the effects of environmental exposure to BPA on ovarian reserve. The study participants consisted of 511 women in reproductive age (25-39 years) who attended an infertility clinic for diagnosis, due to the couples' infertility. BPA urinary concentrations were assessed by the validated gas chromatography ion-trap mass spectrometry method. The ovarian reserve was assessed using ovarian reserve parameters: Hormones concentrations: E2 (estradiol), FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), AMH (anti-Müllerian hormone), and AFC (antral follicle count). In the present study, the negative association between BPA urinary concentrations and AMH (p = 0.02) and AFC (p = 0.03) levels was found.

However, despite the large number of studies on the toxicity and hormonal activity of BPA, there are still open questions and thus considerable media attention regarding BPA toxicity. Hence, it is necessary to develop a sensitive, simple, cost-efficient, specific, portable, and rapid method for monitoring bisphenol A and for high sample throughput and on-site screening analysis. Lateral flow immunoassays have potential as rapid tests for on-site screening. To meet sensitivity criteria, they must be carefully optimized. A latex microparticle-based LFIA for detection of BPA was developed. The sensitivity of the assay was improved by non-contact printing of spot grids as the control and test lines with careful parameter optimization. Results of the test could be visually evaluated within 10 min with a visual cut-off of 10 µg/L (vLOD). Alternatively, photographs were taken, and image analysis performed to set up a calibration, which allowed for a calculated limit of detection (cLOD) of 0.14 µg/L.

Preliminary evidence revealed that in women undergoing IVF treatment, urinary BPA levels were associated with low serum anti-Mullerian hormone, however a definitive relationship between the two has not yet been characterized. This study aimed to evaluate BPA and BPS effects on in vitro oocyte maturation and early preimplantation embryo development through i) analysis of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and anti-Mullerian hormone receptor II (AMHRII), ii) investigation of developmental parameters, such as cleavage, blastocyst rates and developmental arrest, iii) detection of apoptosis and iv) assessment of possible sex ratio skew. An in vitro bovine model was used as a translational model for human early embryonic development. We first assessed AMH and AMHRII levels after bisphenol exposure during oocyte maturation. Zygotes were also analyzed during cleavage and blastocysts stages. Techniques used include in vitro fertilization, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blotting, TUNEL and immunofluorescence. Our findings show that BPA significantly decreased cleavage (p < 0.001), blastocyst (p < 0.005) and overall developmental rates as well as significantly increased embryonic arrest at the 2-4 cell stage (p < 0.05). Additionally, both BPA and BPS significantly increased DNA fragmentation in 2-4 cells, 8-16 cells and blastocyst embryos (p < 0.05). Furthermore, BPA and BPS alter AMH and AMHRII at the mRNA and protein level in both oocytes and blastocysts. BPA, but not BPS, also significantly skews sex ratios towards female blastocysts (p < 0.05). This study shows that BPA affects AMH and AMHRII expression during oocyte maturation and that BPS exerts its effects to a greater extent after fertilization and therefore may not be a safer alternative to BPA. Our data lay the foundation for future functional studies, such as receptor kinetics, downstream effectors, and promoter activation/inhibition to prove a functional relationship between bisphenols and the AMH signalling system.",PMC8330045

34212583,"Yiqing Zhang, Shanshan Guo, Qian Sun",[Research progress on lyophilization for pretreatment of emerging organic contaminants in environmental samples].,2021,"With rapid urbanization, increasing amounts of chemicals are being used in our daily life. Emerging organic contaminants are a large class of chemicals that are widely detected in the environment. They include pharmaceuticals and personal care products, pesticides, perfluorinated compounds, and endocrine-disrupting compounds. Recently, many countries have reported the occurrence of emerging organic contaminants. In addition, emerging organic contaminants are frequently detected in various environmental samples, including river and lake water samples. Despite their low concentrations in the environment, emerging organic contaminants are potential risks to humans and wildlife. Because they could lead to endocrine disrupting effects and the occurrence of resistance genes. Thus, the detection of emerging organic contaminants in the environment is imperative for ecological systems and human health. The recent development of analytical techniques has led to the identification of more emerging organic contaminants in the environment. At present, the commonly used chromatographic separation techniques include liquid chromatography and gas chromatography. For the identification and quantitation of emerging organic contaminants, chromatography is usually combined with spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. The concentrations of emerging organic contaminants are not sufficiently high to be detected directly, and the matrix is complex in environmental samples. Emerging organic contaminants also have diverse properties. Thus, environmental samples must be pretreated before detection. Pretreatment includes the concentration and purification of the environmental samples. The commonly used pretreatment methods are ultrasound-assisted extraction, QuEChERS, liquid-liquid extraction, and solid-phase extraction. With the development of pretreatment methods, solid-phase microextraction and stirred-bar adsorption extraction have also become popular. These sample pretreatment methods have many advantages such as good efficiency and effectivity for recycling target compounds. Hence, they are widely used. However, these methods are time-consuming, in addition to requiring expensive consumables and large amounts of organic solvents. Lyophilization is a technique used for product dehydration, preservation, and storage in the agricultural and food industries. It is also occasionally used to simplify the extraction procedure for drug residue analysis. There are three stages of lyophilization: freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. Lyophilization has many advantages when used for pretreatment, namely, operational simplicity, less consumables, less sample volume, prolonged storage, and minimal sample loss. Lyophilization is thus an alternative method for the pretreatment of emerging organic contaminants in environmental samples. Recently, lyophilization has been applied to the pretreatment of emerging organic contaminants in environmental water samples. In general, a few steps were included during sample analysis. First, the samples were pretreated and frozen before the primary drying stage. After lyophilization, the analytes were extracted using a small amount of organic solvent and dried with nitrogen. Consequently, the elution was reconstructed and detected after dryness and filtration. Many groups of emerging organic contaminants could be recovered, including antibiotics, pesticides, and endocrine-disrupting compounds. The lyophilization could be automated, so that minimal manual intervention was required. By adopting lyophilization, good recoveries and accuracies were achieved. A few cleanup processes were conducted, and a small amount of organic solvent was consumed. Thus, lyophilization is a highly prospective pretreatment method for monitoring emerging organic contaminants, and can be extended to a diverse range of these contaminants. For large-scale and high-frequency sampling campaigns, cheap and convenient pretreatment is urgently needed. In this study, typical emerging organic contaminants are described, along with the universal types of such contaminants and the principles of lyophilization. The application of lyophilization to the detection of emerging organic contaminants in the environment is also introduced. The future of lyophilization is discussed, which provides a reference for emerging contaminant detection in environmental samples.",PMC9404103

These substances are released easily into the environment and can act as endocrine disruptors. Epidemiological studies in children have showed inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between prenatal or postnatal exposure to phthalates and the risk of allergic disease. Our hypothesis is that prenatal exposure to phthalates may contribute to the development of allergies in children. Material and methods: The objective of this study was to determine the associations between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in pregnant women, maternal atopic diathesis, maternal lifestyle, and cord blood IgE. Pregnant mothers and paired newborns (n = 101) were enrolled from an antenatal clinic. The epidemiologic data and the clinical information were collected using standard questionnaires and medical records. The maternal blood and urine samples were collected at 24-28 weeks gestation, and cord blood IgE, IL-12p70, IL-4, and IL-10 levels were determined from the newborns at birth. The link between phthalates and maternal IgE was also assessed. To investigate the effects of phthalates on neonatal immunity, cord blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) were used for cytokine induction in another in vitro experiment. Results: We found that maternal urine monoethyl phthalate (MEP) (a metabolite of di-ethyl phthalate (DEP)) concentrations are positively correlated with the cord blood IgE of the corresponding newborns. The cord blood IL-12p70 levels of mothers with higher maternal urine MEP groups (high DEP exposure) were lower than mothers with low DEP exposure. In vitro experiments demonstrated that DEP could enhance IL-4 production of cord blood MNCs rather than adult MNCs. Conclusion: Prenatal DEP exposure is related to neonatal IgE level and alternation of cytokines relevant to Th1/Th2 polarization. This suggests the existence of a link between prenatal exposure to specific plasticizers and the future development of allergies.",PMC8296186

The role of phthalates in acquired drug resistance remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on acquired drug resistance in breast cancer. MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were exposed to long-term physiological concentration of DEHP for more than three months. Long-exposure DEHP permanently attenuated the anti-proliferative effect of doxorubicin with estrogen receptor-independent activity even after withdrawal of DEHP. Long term DEHP exposure significantly reduced ROS (O2-) level in MDA-MB-231 cells while increased in MCF7 cells. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters possess a widely recognized mechanism of drug resistance and are considered a target for drug therapy. Upregulation of ABC family proteins, ABCB-1 and ABCC-1 observed in DEHP-exposed clones compared to doxorubicin-resistant (DoxR) and parental MDA-MB-231 cells. A viability assay showed enhanced multidrug resistance in DEHP-exposed clones against Dox, topotecan, and irinotecan. Inhibition of ABC transporters with tariquidar, enhanced drug cytotoxicity through increased drug accumulation reversing acquired multidrug resistance in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Tariquidar enhanced Dox cytotoxicity by increasing intracellular ROS production leading to caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling enhanced proliferation and growth of DEHP-exposed MDA-MB-231 cells. Overall, long-term DEHP exposure resulted in acquired multidrug resistance by upregulating ABCB-1 and ABCC1; apart from proliferation PI3K/Akt may be responsible for acquired drug resistance through ABC transporter upregulation. Targeting ABCB1 and ABCC1 with tariquidar may be a promising strategy for reversing the acquired multidrug resistance of triple-negative breast cancer cells.",PMC8230873

This manuscript was prepared based on a meta-analysis of research on the impacts of selected EDCs on human health. Special attention should be paid to bisphenol A (BPA), benzo-α-pyrene, and phthalates due to their proven endocrine activity and presence in our daily lives. Xenoestrogens are absorbed by human organisms through the digestive system since they can migrate to food from food packages and drinks as well as from plastic products used daily. The presence of these chemicals in human organisms is considered a potential cause for some diseases commonly referred to as 'diseases of civilization'.

The three most frequently detected metabolites were monoethyl phthalate, mono-cyclohexyl phthalate, and mono-benzyl phthalate. We also detected mono-n-octyl phthalate and mono(3,5,5-trimethylhexyl) phthalate, which have rarely been observed in urine from infants and toddlers; therefore, di-n-octyl phthalate and bis(3,5,5-trimethylhexyl) phthalate can be considered as potentially new emerging phthalates.

They are endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with xenoestrogenic activities and affect reproductive success in many ways. It was hypothesized that BPA and BPS could adversely affect the folliculogenesis in chickens due to their disruption of the estrogen responses, using either genomic or non-genomic mechanisms. This study investigated the deleterious effects of BPA and BPS on the ovaries when adult layer chickens were orally treated with these EDCs at 50 μg/kg body weight, the reference dose for chronic oral exposure of BPA established by the U.S. EPA. The chickens in both BPA and BPS-treated groups showed a decreased number of the preovulatory follicles. BPA-treated chickens showed a significant decrease in the diameter of F1. Additionally, both BPA and BPS treatments increased the infiltrations of lymphocytes and plasma cells in ovaries. Moreover, it was found that the ovaries of BPS-treated chickens weighed the most among the groups. RNA sequencing and subsequent pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that both BPA- and BPS-treatment groups showed significant changes in gene expression and pathways related to reproduction, immune function and carcinogenesis. Taken together, both BPA and BPS are potentially carcinogenic and have deleterious effects on the fertility of laying chickens by inducing inflammation, suggesting that BPS may not be a safe replacement for BPA.",PMC8275017

However, it is poorly understood whether the effects of EDCs in invertebrates are mediated by hormonal mechanisms. Previously, we showed that bisphenol A (BPA) affected the physiology of the freshwater oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus. In the present study, we examined the mechanism of the impact of BPA on L. variegatus, using pulse rate of the dorsal blood vessel (DBV) as an endpoint. Both long term and acute exposures to BPA increased the pulsing rate of DBV. The former had a distinct inverted-U dose response relationship with a most efficacious dose of 10-9 M, which increased the pulse rate from 8.97 to 10.9 beats/min. The effects of BPA were mimicked by the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol with a most efficacious dose of 10-12 M. Interestingly E2 had no effect on pulsing rate, either acute or long term. The sensitivity of L. variegatus to estrogens were exquisite, with detectable effects at 10-14 to 10-10 M range. Both the long term and acute effects of BPA were partially or fully blocked by various vertebrate estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists, including ICI 182,780, MPP and G15. Our results suggest that the impact of BPA on pulsing rate of L. variegatus is likely mediated by an estrogenic mechanism instead of general toxicity. The exceptionally high sensitivity of L. variegatus to some estrogens makes it a possible tool for estrogenic EDC screening.",PMC8373826

However, little is known about the behavioral or immunologic effects of BPS. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of diets in BPS-treated mice in relation to hyperglycemia, development of type 1 diabetes, immunomodulation, and behavioral changes. Adult male and female nonobese diabetic excluded flora (NODEF) mice were exposed to environmentally relevant doses of BPS (VH, 30, or 300 μg/kg BW) and fed either a soy-based diet, a phytoestrogen-free diet, or a Western diet. NODEF male mice fed a soy-based diet exhibited a decreased curiosity/desire to explore, and possibly increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased short-term memory when exposed to BPS (300 μg/kg BW). In addition, these mice had significant increases in non-fasting blood glucose levels along with increased insulin sensitivity, impaired glucose tolerance, resistance to fasting and proinflammation. Although BPS had little effect on the glucose parameters in NODEF male mice fed a Western diet, there were decreases in %CD24+CD5+ and %B220+CD40L-cell populations and increases in distance traveled during the novel object test, suggesting hyperactivity. NODEF females fed a phytoestrogen-free diet exhibited slight decreases in time spent immobile during the tail suspension test in both the 30 and 300 μg/kg BW dose groups along with increases in %CD4+CD8+ and %Mac3+CD45R+ cell populations, signifying increased hyperactivity and anxiety-like behavior.

We illustrate a novel exposure continuum mapping (ECM) framework that combines the self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm with generalized additive modeling (GAM) in order to integrate spatially-correlated learning into the study mixtures of environmental chemicals. We demonstrate our method using biomarker data on chemical mixtures collected from a diverse mother-child cohort. We obtained biomarker concentrations for 16 prevalent endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) collected in the first-trimester from a large, ethnically/racially diverse cohort of healthy pregnant women (n = 604) during 2009-2012. This included 4 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), 4 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 4 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and 4 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). We applied a two-stage exposure continuum mapping (ECM) approach to investigate the combined impact of the EDCs on birth weight. First, we analyzed our EDC data with SOM in order to reduce the dimensionality of our exposure matrix into a two-dimensional grid (i.e., map) where nodes depict the types of EDC mixture profiles observed within our data. We define this map as the 'exposure continuum map', as the gridded surface reflects a continuous sequence of exposure profiles where adjacent nodes are composed of similar mixtures and profiles at more distal nodes are more distinct. Lastly, we used GAM to estimate a joint-dose response based on the coordinates of our ECM in order to capture the relationship between participant location on the ECM and infant birth weight after adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), education, serum cotinine, total plasma lipids, and infant sex. Single chemical regression models were applied to facilitate comparison. We found that an ECM with 36 mixture profiles retained 70% of the total variation in the exposure data. Frequency analysis showed that the most common profiles included relatively low concentrations for most EDCs (~10%) and that profiles with relatively higher concentrations (for single or multiple EDCs) tended to be rarer (~1%) but more distinct. Estimation of a joint-dose response function revealed that lower birth weights mapped to locations where profile compositions were dominated by relatively high PBDEs and select OCPs. Higher birth weights mapped to locations where profiles consisted of higher PCBs. These findings agreed well with results from single chemical models. Findings from our study revealed a wide range of prenatal exposure scenarios and found that combinations exhibiting higher levels of PBDEs were associated with lower birth weight and combinations with higher levels of PCBs and PFAS were associated with increased birth weight. Our ECM approach provides a promising framework for supporting studies of other exposure mixtures.",PMC8403640

Phthalates are widely used plastic additives released into the environment. Although the effects of phthalates on vertebrates have been extensively studied, there is a knowledge gap regarding their effects on invertebrates. This work analyzes the impact of three phthalates, diethyl phthalate (DEP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), and bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), on the gastropod Physella acuta at the molecular level to establish the putative pathways involved in its response to them. By real-time PCR, we obtained the expression profile of 30 genes in animals exposed for 1 week to 0.1, 10, and 1000 μg/L of each phthalate. The genes cover DNA repair, detoxification, apoptosis, oxidative and stress responses, immunity, energy reserves, and lipid transport. The results show that while DEP and DEHP did not alter the mRNA levels, BBP modulated almost all the analyzed genes. It can be concluded that the impact of BBP is extensive at the molecular level. However, it cannot be dismissed that the increase in transcriptional activity is a general response due to this compound's well-known role as an endocrine disruptor. Additional research is needed to elucidate the differences observed in the impact of these compounds on the gastropod P. acuta.",PMC8169832

Manufacturers have begun using 'BPA-free' alternatives instead of BPA in many consumer products. However, these alternatives have had much less testing and oversight, yet they are already being mass-produced and used across industries from plastics to food-contact coatings. Here, we used human female adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs), a type of adult mesenchymal stem cell, to compare the effects of BPA and BPA alternatives on adipogenesis or fat cell development in vitro. We focused on two commonly used BPA replacements, bisphenol AF (BPAF) and tetramethyl bisphenol F (TMBPF; monomer of the new valPure V70 food-contact coating). Human ASCs were differentiated into adipocytes using chemically defined media in the presence of control differentiation media with and without 17β-estradiol (E2; 10 μM), or with increasing doses of BPA (0, 0.1 and 1 μM), BPAF (0, 0.1, 1 and 10 nM), or TMBPF (0, 0.01 and 0.1 μM). After differentiation, the cells were stained and imaged to visualize and quantify the accumulation of lipid vacuoles and number of developing fat cells. Treated cells were also examined for cell viability and apoptosis (programmed cell death) using the respective cellular assays. Similar to E2, BPA at 0.1 μM and BPAF at 0.1 nM, significantly increased adipogenesis and lipid production by 20% compared to control differentiated cells (based on total lipid vacuole number to cell number ratios), whereas higher levels of BPA and BPAF significantly decreased adipogenesis (p < 0.005). All tested doses of TMBPF significantly reduced adipogenesis and lipid production by 30-40%, likely at least partially through toxic effects on stem cells, as viable cell numbers decreased and apoptosis levels increased throughout differentiation. These findings indicate that low, environmentally-relevant doses of BPA, BPAF, and TMBPF have significant effects on fat cell development and lipid accumulation, with TMBPF having non-estrogenic, anti-adipogenic effects. These and other recent results may provide a potential cellular mechanism between exposure to bisphenols and human obesity, and underscore the likely impact of these chemicals on fat development in vivo.",PMC8160667

Since cyclic AMP (cAMP) plays a key role in reproduction, regulation of its synthesis by E2 may be of biological/pathophysiological relevance. Herein, we investigated whether cAMP production in FT cells (FTCs) is regulated by E2 and environmental estrogens (EE's; xenoestrogens and phytoestrogens). Under basal conditions, low levels of extracellular cAMP were detectable in bovine FTCs (epithelial cells and fibroblasts; 1:1 ratio). Treatment of FTCs with forskolin (AC; adenylyl cyclase activator), isoproterenol (β-adrenoceptor agonist) and IBMX (phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor) dramatically (>10 fold) increased cAMP; whereas LRE1 (sAC; soluble AC inhibitor) and 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine (DDA; transmembrane AC (tmAC)) inhibitor decreased cAMP. Comparable changes in basal and stimulated intracellular cAMP were also observed. Ro-20-1724 (PDE-IV inhibitor), but not milrinone (PDE-III inhibitor) nor mmIBMX (PDE-I inhibitor), augmented forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels, suggesting that PDE-IV dominates in FTCs. E2 increased cAMP levels and CREB phosphorylation in FTCs, and these effects were mimicked by EE's (genistein, 4-hydroxy-2',4',6'-trichlorobiphenyl, 4-hydroxy-2',4',6'-dichlorobiphenyl). Moreover, the effects of E2 and EE were blocked by the tmAC inhibitor DDA, but not by the ERα/β antagonist ICI182780. Moreover, BAPTA-AM (intracellular-Ca2+ chelator) abrogated the effects of E2, but not genistein, on cAMP suggesting differential involvement of Ca2+. Treatment with non-permeable E2-BSA induced cAMP levels and CREB-phosphorylation; moreover, the stimulatory effects of E2 and EEs on cAMP were blocked by G15, a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) antagonist. E2 and IBMX induced cAMP formation was inhibited by LRE1 and DDA suggesting involvement of both tmAC and sAC. Our results provide the first evidence that in FTCs, E2 and EE's stimulate cAMP synthesis via GPER. Exposure of the FT to EE's and PDE inhibitors may result in abnormal non-cyclic induction of cAMP levels which may induce deleterious effects on reproduction.",PMC8158772

The xenoestrogen Bisphenol A (BPA) that is found in various consumer products has been involved in the dysregulation of numerous signalling pathways. In this paper, we present the analysis of a set of 94 genes that have been shown to be dysregulated in presence of BPA in ovarian cancer cell lines since we hypothesised that these genes might be of biomarker potential. This study sought to identify biomarkers of disease and biomarkers of disease-associated exposure. In silico analyses took place using gene expression data extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases. Differential expression was further validated at protein level using immunohistochemistry on an ovarian cancer tissue microarray. We found that 14 out of 94 genes are solely dysregulated in the presence of BPA, while the remaining 80 genes are already dysregulated (p-value < 0.05) in their expression pattern as a consequence of the disease. We also found that seven genes have prognostic power for the overall survival in OC in relation to their expression levels. Out of these seven genes, Keratin 4 (KRT4) appears to be a biomarker of exposure-associated ovarian cancer, whereas Guanylate Binding Protein 5 (GBP5), long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 707 (LINC00707) and Solute Carrier Family 4 Member 11 (SLC4A11) are biomarkers of disease.

Bisphenol S (BPS) is used in the manufacture of consumer products because of its superior thermal stability and is thought to be a safe replacement chemical for its analog bisphenol A (BPA).

Also, the estrogenic chemical 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE2) and a constituent of female oral contraceptives for women, is present in water supplies. To simulate concurrent exposure of the population to chemical mixtures, we investigated the effects of BPA, BPS, EE2, and their combinations on sex steroid secretion in the growing male rat gonad. Prepubertal and pubertal male rats at 21 and 35 days of age were provided test chemicals in drinking water (parts per billion) for 14 days. At termination of exposure, some individual chemical effects were modified by exposure to chemical combinations. Single chemical exposures markedly decreased androgen secretion but their combination (e.g., BPA + BPS + EE2) caused the opposite effect, i.e., increased Leydig cell T secretion. Also, the test chemicals acting alone or in combination increased testicular and Leydig cell 17β-estradiol (E2) secretion. Chemical-induced changes in T and E2 secretion were associated with altered testicular expression of the cholesterol side-chain cleavage (Cyp11a1) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd17β) enzyme protein.

Using sediments collected at a WWTP discharge point as inoculum, at a concentration of 2 mg l-1 complete removal of BPA was observed within 6 days, whereas for the same concentration BPS removal was of 95% after 10 days, which is particularly interesting since this compound is considered recalcitrant to biodegradation and likely to accumulate in the environment.

EDCs are particularly problematic when exposure happens in the fetus and infant due to the high sensitivity of developing organisms to hormone actions. Previous work has shown that prenatal polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure disrupts hypothalamic development, reproductive physiology, mate preference behavior, and social behaviors in a sexually dimorphic manner. Based on evidence that EDCs perturb social behaviors in rodents, we examined effects of PCBs on the neuropeptides oxytocin (OXT) and vasopressin (AVP) that are involved in regulating these behaviors. Rats were exposed prenatally (gestational days 16 and 18) to the weakly estrogenic PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (0.5 or 1 mg/kg), to estradiol benzoate (EB, a positive control), or to the vehicle (3% dimethyl sulfoxide). In adult (~P90) brains, we counted immunolabeled oxytocin and vasopressin cell numbers in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus. EDCs did not change absolute numbers of oxytocin or vasopressin cells in either region, although there were some modest shifts in the rostral-caudal distribution. Second, expression of genes for these nonapeptides (Oxt, Avp), their receptors (Oxtr, Avpr1a), and the estrogen receptor beta (Esr2), was determined by qPCR. In the PVN, there were dose-dependent effects of PCBs in males (Oxt, Oxtr), and effects of EB in females (Avp, Esr2). In the SON, Oxt, and Esr2 were affected by treatments in males.

While the observed specific associations between TGCT and Wolff's Group 1 PCBs cannot be easily explained by bias or confounding, a question can still be asked, that is, could the relationship between PCBs and TGCT differ by age at diagnosis? PCBs tend to bioaccumulate, with more heavily chlorinated PCB congeners tending to have longer half-lives. Half-lives of PCB congeners were reported ranging from 4.6 years for PCB-28 to 41.0 years for PCB-156. The half-life for the heavy PCB congeners (17.8 years) was found to be approximately twice that for the light PCBs (9.6 years) in early studies. Therefore, the same PCB concentration measured in a 20-year-old vs. a 55-year-old is unlikely to represent the same lifetime PCB exposure or type of PCB exposure. In this analysis, we stratified the data by median age of diagnosis of TGCT and further stratified by histologic type of TGCT (seminoma vs non-seminoma) to explore if the risk of TGCT associated with PCB exposures differs by age.",PMC8076715

Previous experiments have shown behavioral deficits caused by EDCs that have implications for social competence and sexual selection. The neuromolecular mechanisms for these behavioral changes induced by EDCs have not been thoroughly explored. Here, we tested the hypothesis that EDCs administered to rats during a critical period of embryonic brain development would lead to the disruption of normal social preference behavior, and that this involves a network of underlying gene pathways in brain regions that regulate these behaviors. Rats were exposed prenatally to human-relevant concentrations of EDCs (polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], vinclozolin [VIN]), or vehicle. In adulthood, a sociosexual preference test was administered. We profiled gene expression of in preoptic area, medial amygdala, and ventromedial nucleus. Prenatal PCBs impaired sociosexual preference in both sexes, and VIN disrupted this behavior in males. Each brain region had unique sets of genes altered in a sex- and EDC-specific manner. The effects of EDCs on individual traits were typically small, but robust; EDC exposure changed the relationships between gene expression and behavior, a pattern we refer to as dis-integration and reconstitution. These findings underscore the effects that developmental exposure to EDCs can have on adult social behavior, highlight sex-specific and individual variation in responses, and provide a foundation for further work on the disruption of genes and behavior after prenatal exposure to EDCs.",PMC8055178

Plasticizers such as Bisphenol A (BPA) and Phthalates (mainly Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate-DEHP) are widespread contaminants classified as endocrine disrupters which share some toxicological profiles and coexist in food and environment. To identify hazards of DEHP and BPA mixtures, the juvenile toxicity test-where rodents are in peripubertal phase of development, resembling childhood-was selected using exposure data from biomonitoring study in children. Biological activity and potential enhanced and/or reduced toxicological effects of mixtures due to common mechanisms were studied, considering endpoints of metabolic, endocrine and reproductive systems. The degree of synergy or antagonism was evaluated by synergy score calculation, using present data and results from the single compound individually administered. In metabolic system, synergic interaction predominates in female and additive in male rats; in the reproductive and endocrine systems, the co-exposure of BPA and DEHP showed interactions mainly of antagonism type. The present approach allows to evaluate, for all the endpoints considered, the type of interaction between contaminants relevant for human health.

In the present work, a case study was performed on Bisphenol AF (BPAF) to explore the application of the EU criteria and EFSA/ECHA guidance document for the ED assessment of a non-pesticide chemical regulated under REACH. A data dossier was built by a systematic literature search (Web of Science, Pubmed, Embase; n = 511), title/abstract screening (n = 124) and full text examination (n = 88). All the information was extracted and systematically reported for 309 parameters (100 for adversity; 209 for endocrine activity). The reliability of studies was assessed (SciRAP tool). Data were synthesized into 96 lines of evidence for adversity (n = 57), and endocrine activity (n = 39); and assessed by weight of evidence methodology. The initial analysis of the evidence indicated EATS-mediated adversity in mammals, therefore a mode of action (MoA) was postulated for both male and female adult exposure. Female MoA included estrogen receptor activation and altered steroidogenesis leading to ovarian dysfunction, altered estrous cycling and impaired female fertility. Male MoA was initiated by androgen receptor inhibition and altered steroidogenesis leading to dysfunction of male reproductive organs and impaired male fertility. The overall conclusion of the ED assessment indicated that BPAF meets the ED criteria for human health. The steps described in the ED guidance document were successfully completed, resulting in a thorough, structured and transparent identification of BPAF as an ED. Advantages and limitations of applying the ED criteria and guidance for a REACH chemical are discussed.",PMC8070297

Therefore, it is urgent to establish a rapid, sensitive, and simple method for the determination of BPA. In this paper, based on the aptamer-mediated single-atom Fe carbon dot catalyst (SAFe) catalyzing the HAuCl4-ethylene glycol (EG) nanoreaction, a new SERS/RRS di-mode detection method for BPA was established. The results show that SAFe exhibits a strong catalytic effect on the HAuCl4-EG nanoreaction, which could generate purple gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS) signals and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effects. After the addition of BPA aptamer (Apt), it could encapsulate SAFe through intermolecular interaction, thus inhibiting its catalytic action, resulting in the reduction of AuNPs generated and the decrease of RRS and SERS signals of the system. With the addition of BPA, Apt was specifically combined with BPA, and SAFe was re-released to restore the catalytic ability; the generated AuNPs increased. As a result of this RRS and SERS signals of the system recovered, and their increment was linear with the concentration of BPA. Thus, the quantification of 0.1-4.0 nM (RRS) and 0.1-12.0 nM (SERS) BPA was realized, and the detection limits were 0.08 nM and 0.03 nM, respectively. At the same time, we used molecular spectroscopy and electron microscopy to study the SAFe-HAuCl4-ethylene glycol indicator reaction, and proposed a reasonable SAFe catalytic reaction mechanism.

Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells were cultured for 14 days in lipogenic differentiation media containing continuous concentrations of vitamin D plus BPA (0.1 nM or 10 nM).

Lipid accumulation was visualized with staining with Oil Red O. In the morphological assessment of mesenchymal stem cells treated with a concentration of 10 nM vitamin D plus BPA, more lipid accumulations were observed in comparison with the group with 0.1 nM concentration. Treatment of hADMSCs with vitamin D plus BPA (0.1 nM) significantly inhibited the induction of PPARγ, C/EBP β, C/EBP α, and FASN related to adipocyte differentiation and development. However, the exposure of cells to the concentration of 10 nM vitamin D plus BPA induced the expression of these genes associated to the adipogenesis. The remarkable increase in the level of SREBP1c was associated to the suppression of INSIG2 in treated preadipocytes with 10 nM vitamin D plus BPA.

We conducted a cross-sectional study on 94 Latino immigrant adults in Maryland. Participants were >18 years of age and working in a service-based industry. We administered an interviewer-administered questionnaire to capture information on potential exposure determinants (e.g., demographic characteristics, consumer product use, and workplace exposures and behaviors) and using HPLC/MS-MS we quantified concentrations of 9 urinary phthalate metabolites: monoethyl phthalate (MEP, diethyl phthalate metabolite); mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP, di-n-butyl phthalate metabolite); mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP, di-isobutyl phthalate metabolite; monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP, benzylbutyl phthalate metabolite); molar sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate or DEHP metabolites [mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECCP)]; and mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP, a non-specific metabolite of several phthalates including di-n-butyl phthalate and di-n-octyl phthalate). DEHP was analyzed as the molar sum of four metabolites (ΣDEHP = MEHP + MEHHP + MECPP + MEOHP). Spearman correlations, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted to assess bivariate associations between metabolite concentrations and potential exposure determinants. Covariates associated with metabolites at p < 0.10 in bivariate analyses were included in multivariable linear regression models to assess the independent effects of predictors on metabolite concentrations. Uncorrected median phthalate metabolite concentrations were lower in our study population (<LOD-12.8 μg/L) compared to those reported in the US general population (1.0-28.8 μg/L) and adult populations in other countries. Geometric mean specific gravity-corrected concentrations for metabolites detected in >50% of samples ranged between 1.4 and 23.6 μg/L. While we observed some significant associations with select predictors in our bivariate analysis, select associations were attenuated in multivariable regression models.

Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated on gestational days 16 and 18 with the PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221), vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil), or estradiol benzoate (EB, 50 μg/kg), the latter a positive control for estrogenic effects of A1221. Maternal- and paternal-lineage F2 and F3 generations were bred using untreated partners. The anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and arcuate nucleus (ARC), involved in the hypothalamic control of reproduction, were dissected from F1 to F3 females and males, RNA extracted, and gene expression measured in a qPCR array. We detected unique gene-expression profiles in each generation, which were sex- and lineage-specific. In the AVPV, treatment significantly changed 10, 25, and 11 transcripts in F1, F2, and F3 generations, whereas 10, 1, and 12 transcripts were changed in these generations in the ARC. In the F1 AVPV and ARC, most affected transcripts were decreased by A1221. In the F2 AVPV, most effects of A1221 were observed in females of the maternal lineage, whereas only Pomc expression changed in the F2 ARC (by EB). The F3 AVPV and ARC were mainly affected by EB. It is notable that results in one generation do not predict results in another, and that lineage was a major determinant in results. Thus, transient prenatal exposure of F1 rats to A1221 or EB can alter hypothalamic gene expression across three generations in a sex- and lineage-dependent manner, leading to the conclusion that the legacy of PCBs continues for generations.",PMC8444700

Chronic exposure to BBP did not promote the growth of endometriotic lesions; however, the lesion survival rate in BBP-treated mice did increase significantly compared with control mice. Multiparametric flow cytometry showed that BBP exposure did not affect the homeostasis of infiltrated immune subsets in lesions but did enhance CD44 (adhesion marker) expression on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Blocking CD44 interactions locally inhibited endometriotic lesion growth. Immunofluorescence results further confirmed that CD44 blocking inhibited pDC infiltration and reduced the frequency of CD44+ pDCs in endometriotic tissues.

Response surface methodology (RSM) study was employed to optimise and evaluate the culture conditions to improve the biodegradation of DINP. The optimal conditions were a pH 7.0, 31 °C and an initial DINP concentration of 500 mg L-1, resulting in almost complete biodegradation (99%) in 168 h.

In the RT-PCR analysis, Tshr expression was significantly lower in both DEHP groups (50 and 500 mg/kg) compared to that in the vehicle group, and IHC staining showed that TSHR expression in the 50 mg/kg DEHP group significantly decreased. DEHP treatment to FRTL-5 cells significantly down-regulated Tshr expression. DEHP treatment also reduced luciferase activity in a reporter gene assay for TSHR. Although overall genetic changes in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway are not clear, DEHP exposure could significantly down-regulate Tshr expression in thyroid glands. Down-regulation of Tshr gene appears to be one of potential mechanisms of thyroid disruption by DEHP exposure.",PMC8090463

We investigated the association of prenatal exposure to mixtures of persistent endocrine disruptors (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances [PFAS], polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], and organochlorine pesticides) with birth size among female offspring in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), based in the United Kingdom in 1991-1992. We quantified concentrations of 52 endocrine-disrupting chemicals in maternal serum collected during pregnancy at median 15-week gestation. Birth weight, crown-to-heel length, and head circumference were measured at birth; ponderal index and small for gestational age were calculated from these. We used repeated holdout Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression to examine mixtures in 313 mothers. Using WQS regression, all mixtures (each chemical class separately and all three together) were inversely associated with birth weight. A one-unit increase in WQS index (a one-decile increase in chemical concentrations) for all three classes combined was associated with 55 g (β = -55 g, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -89, -22 g) lower birth weight. Associations were weaker but still inverse using Bayesian kernel machine regression. Under both methods, PFAS were the most important contributors to the association with birth weight. We also observed inverse associations for crown-to-heel length. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to mixtures of persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals affects birth size.",PMC8159871

In cross-sectional analyses, mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate and the sum of di-isobutyl phthalate metabolites were inversely associated with total hip BMD among HT nonusers, but not among HT users. Longitudinal analyses showed greater declines in total hip BMD among HT nonusers and with highest concentrations of mono-3-carboxyoctyl phthalate (-1.80%; 95% CI, -2.81% to -0.78%) or monocarboxynonyl phthalate (-1.84%; 95% CI, -2.80% to -0.89%); similar associations were observed with femoral neck BMD.

The aim of this study was to measure human milk BPA concentrations in Turkish women and thus exclusively breastfed infants’ exposure to BPA. Healthy, postnatal, exclusively breastfeeding women were recruited and breast milk samples were collected. Free BPA concentration was analyzed in the milk samples using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Participants’ demographic characteristics and nutritional habits were investigated through face-to-face interviews using a detailed questionnaire. Eighty women participated. Median milk free BPA level was 0.63 μg/L. There was no statistically significant association between maternal body mass index, birth type, parity, infant birth week, infant birth weight, and human milk BPA concentration. Nevertheless, there was a significant association between human milk BPA level and consumption of fast-food and carbonated drinks (p=0.022 and p=0.018, respectively).

Methods: We measured urinary phthalate metabolites, phenols, and parabens collected in 2008 among 73 females from the ELEMENT study. MetS and its components (Abdominal Obesity, Hypertriglyceridemia, Cholesterolemia, Hypertension, and Hyperglycemia) were assessed in 2017. We regressed log-transformed EDC concentrations on MetS and MetS components using logistic regression, adjusting for age and physical activity. Results: At follow-up, the mean (SD) age was 46.6 (6.3) years; the prevalence of MetS was 34.3%. Sum of dibutyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and monoethyl phthalate (MEP) were associated with an increased odds of hypertriglyceridemia. 2,5-dichlorophenol (2,5 DCP) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4 DCP) were associated with increased odds of hypertriglyceridemia.

Fetal exposure to BPA is of concern due to the elevated sensitivity, which particularly relates to the developing brain. Several epidemiological studies have investigated the association between prenatal BPA exposure and neurodevelopment, but the results have been inconclusive. To assess the association between in utero exposure to BPA and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD-) symptoms and symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in 2 and 5-year old Danish children. In the prospective Odense Child Cohort, BPA was measured in urine samples collected in gestational week 28 and adjusted for osmolality. ADHD and ASD symptoms were assessed with the use of the ADHD scale and ASD scale, respectively, derived from the Child Behaviour Checklist preschool version (CBCL/1½-5) at ages 2 and 5 years. Negative binomial and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between maternal BPA exposure (continuous ln-transformed or divided into tertiles) and the relative differences in ADHD and ASD problem scores and the odds (OR) of an ADHD and autism score above the 75th percentile adjusting for maternal educational level, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity and child age at evaluation in 658 mother-child pairs at 2 years of age for ASD-score, and 427 mother-child pairs at 5 years of age for ADHD and ASD-score. BPA was detected in 85.3% of maternal urine samples even though the exposure level was low (median 1.2 ng/mL). No associations between maternal BPA exposure and ASD at age 2 years or ADHD at age 5 years were found. Trends of elevated Odds Ratios (ORs) were seen among 5 year old children within the 3rd tertile of BPA exposure with an ASD-score above the 75th percentile (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 0.97,3.32), being stronger for girls (OR = 3.17, 95% CI 1.85,9.28). A dose-response relationship was observed between BPA exposure and ASD-score at 5 years of age (p-trend 0.06) in both boys and girls, but only significant in girls (p-trend 0.03). Our findings suggest that prenatal BPA exposure even in low concentrations may increase the risk of ASD symptoms which may predict later social abilities.

We examined the associations of prenatal POP exposures with body mass index (BMI) from age 4 to 18 years, and with other CM risk markers in adolescence. We analysed 379 children from the Spanish INMA-Menorca birth cohort study with measured cord blood POP concentrations. We calculated BMI z-scores at ages 4, 6, 11, 14 and 18 years using the WHO growth reference. Body fat % was measured at 11 and 18 years and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and blood pressure (BP) at 11, 14 and 18 years. We measured CM biomarkers in fasting blood collected at age 14 years and calculated a CM-risk score as the sum of the sex-, and age-specific z-scores for waist circumference, mean arterial BP, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, fasting blood triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (n = 217). Generalised estimating equations and multivariate linear regression models assessed the associations with repeated and single time-point measures, respectively. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) exposure in the third tertile, compared to the first tertile, was associated with higher BMI (β = 0.24; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.47) and WHtR z-score (β = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.51).

We measured child height and weight at age five to calculate the body mass index (BMI) z-scores and overweight/obesity status. The association between prenatal urinary concentrations of biomarkers with the childhood BMI z-score and overweight/obesity status was analyzed using single-pollutant models and two mixture methods: Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BMH) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate, monocarboxy-isononly phthalate (metabolites of diethyl phthalate and di-isodecyl phthalate, respectively), and propylparaben were consistently associated with an increased BMI z-score and overweight/obesity status across all modeling approaches. Higher prenatal exposures to the cumulative biomarker mixture also trended with greater childhood adiposity. These results, robust across two methods that control for co-pollutant confounding, suggest that prenatal exposure to certain phthalates and parabens may increase the risk for obesity in early childhood.",PMC7918439

Connexins (Cx) are gap junctional proteins that may be affected by bisphenols, providing insight into their mechanism during development. Cxs 37 and 43 are crucial in facilitating cell communication between cumulus cells and oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs), denuded oocytes, and cumulus cells were exposed to 0.05 mg/mL BPA or BPS for 24 h. Both compounds had no effect on Cx43. Cumulus cells exhibited a significant increase in Cx37 expression following BPA (p = 0.001) and BPS (p = 0.017) exposure. COCs treated with BPA had increased Cx37 protein expression, whilst BPS showed no effects, suggesting BPA and BPS act through different mechanisms. Experiments conducted in in vitro cultured cumulus cells, obtained by stripping germinal vesicle oocytes, showed significantly increased expression of Cx37 in BPA, but not the BPS, treated group. BPA significantly increased Cx37 protein expression, while BPS did not.

We assessed confounder-adjusted associations between multiple food and beverage consumption habits, summarized using a principal component analysis, as predictors of maternal urinary phthalate metabolite levels, stratified by race. Results: Whites reported significantly greater unprocessed food consumption (42.5% vs. 32.0%; p < 0.001) and storage of food in clear unbreakable plastic containers (66.5% vs. 49.3%; p < 0.001) than Blacks, while Blacks consumed more canned fruits and vegetables (23.5% vs. 12.2%; p < 0.001) than Whites.

However, the cellular effects of BPA on the eyes have not been widely investigated. This study aimed to investigate the cellular cytotoxicity by BPA exposure on human retinoblastoma cells. BPA did not show cytotoxic effects, such as apoptosis, alterations to cell viability and cell cycle regulation. Comparative analysis of the transcriptome and proteome profiles were investigated after long-term exposure of Y79 cells to low doses of BPA. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq revealed that mRNA expression of the post-transcriptional regulation-associated gene sets was significantly upregulated in the BPA-treated group. Cell cycle regulation-associated gene sets were significantly downregulated by exposure to BPA. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis at the transcript level indicated that alternative splicing events, particularly retained introns, were noticeably altered by low-dose BPA treatment. Additionally, proteome profiling using MALDI-TOF-MS identified a total of nine differentially expressed proteins. These results suggest that alternative splicing events and altered gene/protein expression patterns are critical phenomena affected by long-term low-dose BPA exposure.

We used multivariable linear regression to examine associations between the geometric mean of phthalate metabolite levels across pregnancy and CPT scores in childhood or adolescence separately, adjusting for age, years schooling (at 9-18 only), maternal education, and specific gravity. Although average in utero phthalate concentrations were not associated with CPT scores in childhood, interquartile range (IQR) increases of in utero MBzP, MCPP, and MBP were associated with 4.2%, 4.7%, and 4.5% (p < 0.05) higher Omissions scores in adolescence, respectively, indicating higher inattention.

In addition, urinary DEHP metabolite levels during adolescence were cross-sectionally associated with poorer scores on several CPT indices indicating greater inattention. These findings suggest that in utero phthalate exposure may have adverse effects on attention, but these effects may not appear until adolescence, a period of extensive neurodevelopment.

In contrast, we demonstrated that p,p'DDT decreased the cyclic AMP (cAMP) production induced by human choriogonadotropin (hCG). This study evaluated further the effects of p,p'DDT on Gs-, β-arrestin 2- and steroidogenesis pathways induced by hCG or luteinizing hormone (LH). We used Chinese hamster ovary cells line stably expressing hCG/LHR. The effects of 10-100 µM p,p'DDT on cAMP production and on β-arrestin 2 recruitment were measured using bioluminescence and time-resolved resonance energy transfer technology. The impact of 100 µM of p,p'DDT on steroid secretion was analysed in murine Leydig tumor cell line (mLTC-1). In cAMP assays, 100 µM p,p'DDT increased the EC50 by more than 300% and reduced the maximum response of the hCG/LHR to hCG and hLH by 30%. This inhibitory effect was also found in human granulosa cells line and in mLTC-1 cells. Likewise, 100 µM p,p'DDT decreased the hCG- and hLH-promoted β-arrestin 2 recruitment down to 14.2 and 26.6%, respectively.

EDC exposure, especially during critical periods of development like the prenatal window, may interfere with the body's endocrine system, which can affect growth and developmental outcomes such as puberty. Most studies have examined one EDC at a time in relation to disease; however, humans are exposed to many EDCs. By studying mixtures, the human experience can be more closely replicated. We investigated the association of prenatal exposure to persistent EDCs (poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)) as mixtures with early menarche among female offspring in a nested case-control study within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) recruited in the United Kingdom in 1991-1992. Concentrations of 52 EDCs were quantified in maternal serum samples collected during pregnancy. Daughter's age at menarche was ascertained through mailed questionnaires sent annually. We used repeated holdout weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to examine the association between prenatal exposure to multiple EDCs and early menarche (<11.5 (n = 218) vs. ≥11.5 years (n = 230)) for each chemical class separately (PFAS, PCBs, and OCPs) and for all three classes combined. Models adjusted for maternal age at menarche, maternal education, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, maternal age, prenatal smoking, and gestational week at sample collection. Mixture models showed null associations between prenatal exposure to EDC mixtures and early menarche. Using WQS regression, the odds ratio for early menarche for a one-decile increase in chemical concentrations for all three classes combined was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.05); using BKMR, the odds ratio when all exposures were at the 60th percentile compared to the median was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.05). Results suggest the overall effect of prenatal exposure to persistent EDC mixtures is not associated with early menarche.",PMC8111784

Due to current lifestyle trends, young people tend to consume fast food, to use disposable products, and to utilize convenient household items, all of which are major sources of EDCs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a dietary modification intervention on menstrual pain and urinary bisphenol A (BPA) levels throughout three menstrual cycles in female college students who experienced severe menstrual pain. We also analyzed participants' adherence to the intervention and examined whether their level of adherence was associated with differences in the effects of the intervention. A single-group pretest and repeated posttest experimental design was employed. Thirty female college students with a score of 5 or higher on a menstrual pain scale were recruited through convenience sampling. During three menstrual cycles, menstrual pain was scored on a 10-point scale after each cycle, and urinary BPA levels were measured from the first morning urine collected after each cycle. The intervention involved three components: small-group education, follow-up monitoring, and peer support via social network communication. Statistical analyses were conducted using Friedman one-way repeated-measure analysis of variance by ranks, non-parametric two-way analysis of variance, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test as a post-hoc test. The dietary modification intervention had significant effects on menstrual pain at all three time points of menstrual cycles (χ2 = 119.64, p = 0.000) and on urinary BPA levels until the 2nd menstrual cycle (χ2 = 205.42, p = 0.000). Slightly fewer than half (43.3%) of the participants were highly adherent. Menstrual pain differed according to adherence level (F = 4.67, p = 0.032) and decreased over time through the third cycle post-intervention (F = 18.30, p = 0.000). Urinary BPA levels also decreased significantly (F = 7.94, p = 0.000), but did not differ according to adherence level. The dietary modification intervention was effective and sustainable for reducing menstrual pain and urinary BPA levels. Detailed information about EDCs and dietary experiences seemed to encourage the young women to become more concerned about EDCs and to perform self-protective actions. Further experimental research is suggested to examine the relationships of EDCs with various health indicators in women. KCT0005472 at 2020-9-24 retrospectively registered.",PMC7871389

Phthalates and their metabolites are consistently detected in humans, indicating widespread and continuous exposure to multiple phthalates. Thus, environmentally relevant mixtures of phthalates and phthalate metabolites were investigated to determine the effects of phthalates on the function of the ovary during the neonatal period of development. Neonatal ovaries from CD-1 mice were cultured with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO; vehicle control), phthalate mixture (0.1-100 μg/mL), or phthalate metabolite mixture (0.1-100 μg/mL). The phthalate mixture was composed of 35% diethyl phthalate, 21% di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 15% dibutyl phthalate, 15% diisononyl phthalate, 8% diisobutyl phthalate, and 5% benzylbutyl phthalate. The phthalate metabolite mixture was composed of 37% monoethyl phthalate, 19% mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 15% monobutyl phthalate, 10% monoisononyl phthalate, 10% monoisobutyl phthalate, and 8% monobenzyl phthalate. After 96 h of culture, ovaries were harvested for histological analysis of folliculogenesis, gene expression analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis regulators, and immune staining for cell proliferation and apoptosis. The metabolite mixture significantly decreased the number and percentage of abnormal follicles (100 μg/mL) compared to controls. The metabolite mixture also significantly increased the expression of cell cycle inhibitors (100 μg/mL) and the antiapoptotic factor Bcl2l10 (10 μg/mL) compared to controls. The phthalate mixture did not significantly alter gene expression or follicle counts, but ovaries exposed to the phthalate mixture (0.1 μg/mL) exhibited marginally significantly increased apoptosis as revealed by DNA fragmentation staining.

The effects of adult exposure to low doses of DEHP alone or in an environmental phthalate mixture on estrous cyclicity, reproductive behavior, and underlying neural structures were analyzed in female mice. Two-month-old C57BL/6J females were exposed orally for 6 wk to DEHP alone (0, 5 or 50μg/kg/d) or to DEHP (5μg/kg/d) in a phthalate mixture. Estrous cyclicity was analyzed in intact mice, and behavior [lordosis, olfactory preference, partner preference, ability to stimulate male ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)] was measured in ovariectomized mice primed with estradiol and progesterone. Immunohistochemical studies were conducted in the neural structures involved in behavior for estrogen receptor (ER) α and progesterone receptor (PR). Exposure to DEHP alone or in mixture lengthened the estrous cycle duration, with a shorter proestrus and longer estrus and metestrus stages. Under normalized hormonal levels, females exposed to DEHP alone or in mixture exhibited altered olfactory preference. A lower lordosis behavior and ability to attract and stimulate male emission of courtship USVs was observed, probably due to modifications of pheromonal emission in exposed females. The behavioral alterations were associated with a lower number of PR-expressing neurons, without changes in ERα, in the neural circuitry underlying sexual behavior. The majority of effects observed was comparable between the two DEHP doses and were driven by DEHP in the mixture. Exposure to environmental doses of DEHP alone or in mixture altered several components of female sexual behavior in mice, probably through selective disruption of neural PR signaling. Together with the previously reported vulnerability of male mice, this finding suggests a major impact of exposure to phthalates on sexual reproduction, including in other species with similar neural regulatory processes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7662.",PMC7839353

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between ASR and endometriosis were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for age (years), body mass index (kg/m2), serum cotinine (ng/ml), and breastfeeding conditional on parity. Bayesian hierarchical models (BHM) compared estimated associations for adipose and ASR to serum. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) estimated change in latent health and 95% posterior intervals (PI) between chemical mixtures and endometriosis. Select ASR for estrogenic PCBs and OCPs were associated with an increased odds of an endometriosis diagnosis, but not for anti-estrogenic PCBs or PBDEs. Across all chemicals, BHMs generated ORs that were on average 14% (95% PI: 6%, 22%) higher for adipose and 20% (95% PI: 12%, 29%) higher for ASR in comparison to serum. ORs from BHMs were greater for estrogenic PCBs and OCPs, with no differences for PBDEs.

Thirty women with obesity (31.1 ± 5.6 kg/m2, 21.1 ± 3.1 years) were randomly assigned to an intervention or control. The intervention included weekly face-to-face meetings to reduce bisphenol exposures from food, cosmetics, and packaged products. Fasting urinary bisphenols, creatinine, and weight were assessed at study entry and after 3 weeks. The intervention was evaluated as feasible (100% of enrollment and recruitment, 96% of retention and attendance at lesson plan visits, and 96% of a collection of urine samples). Adherence to the intervention was estimated based on completion of self-monitoring records; the number of daily records completed was 7.7 ± 1.3 (mean ± SD) after week 1, 7.1 ± 1.5 after week 2, and 4.4 ± 0.9 after week 3.

Moreover, changes in fluorescence intensity in the green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic (Tg) lines Tg(HuC:eGFP), Tg(sox10:eGFP), and Tg(mbp:GFP) were measured after exposure to six phthalates, and changes in the expression profiles of genes involved in the cholinergic (ache) and dopaminergic systems (dat, th, and drd1b) were assessed. Exposure to BBzP, DEHP, and DiNP affected larval behaviors, whereas exposure to DMP, DEP, and DnOP revealed no alterations. A reduced expression of Tg(HuC:eGFP) was observed upon exposure to BBzP, DEHP, and DiNP. The expression of Tg(sox10:eGFP) and Tg(mbp:GFP) was reduced only in response to BBzP and DiNP, respectively. Further, exposure to DiNP upregulated ache and drd1b. The upregulation of ache and downregulation of drd1b was observed in DEHP-exposed groups. Exposure to BBzP suppressed th expression.

A total of 18 immature male Swiss albino mice (3.5 weeks old) were randomly divided into three groups and treated as follows: Group I, no treatment (sham control); Group II, sterile corn oil only (vehicle control); Group III, BPA (400 μg/kg) in sterile corn oil. At 9.5 weeks old, F0 males were mated with unexposed females. F0 offspring (F1 generation) were monitored for postnatal development for 10 weeks. At 11.5 weeks old, the animals were sacrificed to examine testicular architecture, sperm parameters, including DNA integrity, and oxidative stress biomarkers. Results showed that BPA significantly induced changes in the body and testis weights of the F0 and F1 generation BPA lineages compared to F0 and F1 generation control lineages. A decrease in sperm count and motility with further, increased sperm abnormalities, no or few sperm DNA alterations and elevated levels of MDA, PC and NO were recorded. Similar effects were found in BPA exposed F0 males, but were more pronounced in the F0 offspring. In addition, BPA caused alterations in the testicular architecture. These pathological changes extended transgenerationally to F1 generation males' mice, but the pathological changes were more pronounced in the F1 generation. Our findings demonstrate that the biological and health BPA impacts do not end in paternal adults, but are passed on to offspring generations.

Their phagocytosis and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) oxidase activity were assessed via Park's method with latex beads and Park's test with nitroblue tetrazolium. To assess the total concentration of nitric oxide (NO), the Griess reaction was utilized. Flow cytometry was used to assess the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens. The formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was analyzed using a microscope (IN Cell Analyzer 2200 system). Expression of the investigated proteins was determined using Western blot. The analysis of results obtained for both sexes demonstrated that after exposure to BPA, the chemotactic capacity of neutrophils was reduced. In the presence of BPA, the phagocytic activity was found to be elevated in the cells obtained from women and reduced in the cells from men. Following exposure to BPA, the percentage of neutrophils with CD14 and CD284 (TLR4) expression, as well as the percentage of cells forming NETs, was increased in the cells from both sexes.

In this study, a yeast multi endocrine-effect screen (YMEES) for the detection of endocrine effects is combined with HPTLC. Simultaneous detection of estrogenic, androgenic, and gestagenic effects on the HPTLC plate is achieved by mixing different genetically modified Arxula adeninivorans yeast strains, which contain either the human estrogen, androgen, or progesterone receptor. Depending on the yeast strain, different fluorescent proteins are formed when an appropriate substance binds to the specific hormone receptor. This allows to measure hormonal effects at different wavelengths. Two yeast cell application approaches, immersion and spraying, are compared. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the method are shown by dose-response investigations for reference compounds. The spraying approach indicated similar sensitivities and higher precisions for the tested hormones compared to immersion. The EC10s for estrone (E1), 17β-estradiol (E2), 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and progesterone (P4) were 95, 1.4, 10, 7.4, and 15 pg/spot, respectively.

CB is present in the enteric nervous system (ENS) situated in the gastrointestinal tract, which controls the majority of activities of the stomach and intestine. The influence of various doses of bisphenol A (BPA)-a chemical compound widely used in plastics production-on the number and distribution of CB-positive enteric neuronal cells in the porcine caecum was investigated with an immunofluorescence technique. The obtained results showed that low dosages of BPA resulted in an increase in the number of CB-positive neuronal cells in the myenteric (MP) and inner submucous (ISP) plexuses, whereas it did not alter the number of such neuronal cells in the outer submucous plexus (OSP). High dosages of BPA caused the increase in the amount of CB-positive perikarya in all the above-mentioned kinds of the caecal neuronal plexuses. These observations strongly suggest that CB in the ENS participates in the processes connected with the toxic activity of BPA. Most likely, the changes noted in this experiment result from the adaptive and protective properties of CB.",PMC7824670

There is however a paucity of literature examining this association, and no study has accounted for the complex nature of EDCs exposure as a time-varying mixture of chemicals. We examined the association between trimester-specific EDCs mixture and GWG in pregnant women attending a fertility clinic, to identify windows of susceptibility to such exposures, and assess the individual contribution of each chemical over pregnancy. We included 243 pregnant women from the Environment and Reproductive Health (EARTH) Study, who provided up to 3 urine samples (one per trimester), and with available data on GWG. Urinary concentrations of 7 phthalate metabolites, bisphenol A, and 2 parabens, corrected for specific gravity, were included in the analysis. The association between trimester-specific EDCs mixture and GWG was evaluated using multiple regression models - categorizing exposures into concentration quartiles- and with Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR), while adjusting for potential confounders. Hierarchical BKMR (hBKMR) was used to account for the time-varying nature of chemical concentrations over pregnancy, identifying the most important trimester and most important EDC within each trimester. During 1st trimester, higher GWG was observed at higher sum of metabolites of di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (ΣDEHP) from both multiple regression (e.g. comparing the 4th quartile with the 1st: β = 2.36 kg, 95% CI: 0.47, 5.19) and BKMR. During 2nd and 3rd trimesters, positive associations with mono-n-butyl phthalate and propylparaben, and negative with ΣDEHP and methylparaben were observed. When evaluating exposures as a time-varying mixture with hBKMR, 1st trimester was the most important exposure window when evaluating prenatal urinary EDCs in relation to GWG. Within the 1st trimester, urinary ΣDEHP, mono-isobutyl phthalate and propylparaben had the highest contribution in the positive association between the mixture and GWG. We observed positive associations between urinary EDCs during pregnancy, especially DEHP metabolites, and GWG. Our results suggest the 1st trimester of pregnancy as the time window of highest susceptibility to the effects of EDCs on GWG, with potential indication for the design of public health interventions, informing prevention strategies for reducing sources of exposure at specific time points.",PMC7946748

The chemical waste from the industry is sometimes discharges into lakes and rivers, and then these surface waters can be polluted. So, this article aims to investigate the bio-sorption process of BPA by the inactivated lichen (Pseudoevernia furfuracea) biomass from aqueous solution. At initial, the effect of the variables such as initial BPA concentration, solution pH, temperature, contact time and recovery rate on the bio-sorption process was investigated. From the optimal results, it has been observed that the highest removal efficiency is approximately 64% at a contact time of 3-h, the bio-sorbent concentration of 9 mg/L, initial BPA concentration of 40 mg/L, and agitation speed of 150 rpm at pH 5.0. In explaining the bio-sorption potential of lichen biomass, Langmuir and/or Redlich-Peterson isotherms with two and three parameters, respectively were observed to be better fit with the experimental isotherm data (R2 = 0.982). From equilibrium data based on difference between the measured and predicted results (qe, exp and qe, pre), it was shown that biosorption of BPA could be best described by the pseudo second order kinetic model with minimum sum of square error of 2.61%. In addition, it shows more film diffusion, and partly pore diffusion in linearity region in terms of kinetic sorption behaviors of BPA in the rate-limiting step as well as intra-particle diffusion according to Boyd's kinetic model with better regression coefficient than 0.981 when compared to the other used kinetic models, including Bangham's pore diffusion and Elovich kinetic models (with R2 of 0.958 and 0.929). The thermodynamic studies showed that the biosorption process was spontaneous, and chemically feasible. Therefore, due to be low-cost, eco-friendly character, wide availability and easily accessible, the lichen biomass could be used as a promising bio-sorbent for the removal of BPA from the environment and wastewater effluents.",PMC7721836

To help to address the data gap, we conducted a hypothesis-generating investigation of associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and reproductive outcomes among women (n = 56) and their male partners (n = 43) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Urine was collected from participants on the day of oocyte retrieval. Samples were analyzed for a series of phthalates, MEP, MBP, MPP, MHxP, MEHP, MEHHP, MECPP, MiNP, MiDP, MCHP, and MBzP, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We employed Poisson regression with robust variance estimation to estimate associations between urinary phthalate levels and biochemical pregnancy and live birth, adjusted for partner's concentration and confounding factors. Doublings in women's MBP (relative risk (RR) = 0.32, 95 % CI: 0.13, 0.78), and men's MEHP (RR = 0.28, 95 % CI: 0.09, 0.83), were associated with a lower likelihood for pregnancy.

Our results suggest that phthalate exposure may impact IVF outcomes, and underscore the importance of including male partners when investigating the impact of phthalate exposure on IVF. These results also suggest that clinical recommendations should include male partners for limiting phthalate exposure. Still, a larger and more comprehensive investigation is necessary to more definitively assess the risks.",PMC7897280

There is evidence that exposure to hormonally active agents (or endocrine disrupting chemicals; EDCs) during childhood may play a role in accelerating or delaying menarche. The goal of this study was to generate hypotheses on the relationship between exposure to multiple EDCs and timing of menarche by applying a two-stage machine learning approach. We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for years 2005-2008. Data were analyzed for 229 female participants 12-16 years of age who had blood and urine biomarker measures of 41 environmental exposures, all with >70% above limit of detection, in seven classes of chemicals. We modeled risk for earlier menarche (<12 years of age vs older) with exposure biomarkers. We applied a two-stage approach consisting of a random forest (RF) to identify important exposure combinations associated with timing of menarche followed by multivariable modified Poisson regression to quantify associations between exposure profiles (""combinations"") and timing of menarche. RF identified urinary concentrations of monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) as the most important feature in partitioning girls into homogenous subgroups followed by bisphenol A (BPA) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). In this first stage, we identified 11 distinct exposure biomarker profiles, containing five different classes of EDCs associated with earlier menarche. MEHP appeared in all 11 exposure biomarker profiles and phenols appeared in five. Using these profiles in the second-stage of analysis, we found a relationship between lower MEHP and earlier menarche (MEHP ≤ 2.36 ng/mL vs >2.36 ng/mL: adjusted PR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.80). Combinations of lower MEHP with benzophenone-3, 2,4-DCP, and BPA had similar associations with earlier menarche, though slightly weaker in those smaller subgroups. For girls not having lower MEHP, exposure profiles included other biomarkers (BPA, enterodiol, monobenzyl phthalate, triclosan, and 1-hydroxypyrene); these showed largely null associations in the second-stage analysis. Adjustment for covariates did not materially change the estimates or CIs of these models. We observed weak or null effect estimates for some exposure biomarker profiles and relevant profiles consisted of no more than two EDCs, possibly due to small sample sizes in subgroups. A two-stage approach incorporating machine learning was able to identify interpretable combinations of biomarkers in relation to timing of menarche; these should be further explored in prospective studies. Machine learning methods can serve as a valuable tool to identify patterns within data and generate hypotheses that can be investigated within future, targeted analyses.",PMC8673778

Human exposure concentrations to estrone and BPA can be as low as nanomolar levels. However, very few toxicological studies have focused on the nanomolar-dose effects. Low level of EDCs can potentially cause non-monotonic responses. In addition, exposures at different developmental stages can lead to different health outcomes. To identify the nanomolar-dose effects of estrone and BPA, we used zebrafish modeling to study the phenotypic and transcriptomic responses after extended duration exposure from 0 to 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) and short-term exposure at days 4-5 post fertilization. We found that non-monotonic transcriptomic responses occurred after extended duration exposures at 1 nM of estrone or BPA. At this level, estrone also caused hypoactivity locomotive behavior in zebrafish. After both extended duration and short-term exposures, BPA led to more apparent phenotypic responses, i.e. skeletal abnormalities and locomotion changes, and more significant transcriptomic responses than estrone exposure. After short-term exposure, BPA at concentrations equal or above 100 nM affected locomotive behavior and changed the expression of both estrogenic and non-estrogenic genes that are linked to neurological diseases. These data provide gaps of mechanisms between neurological genes expression and associated phenotypic response due to estrone or BPA exposures. This study also provides insights for assessing the acceptable concentration of BPA and estrone in aquatic environments.",PMC7790172

One of the less known active neuronal substances found in the enteric neurons is neuregulin 1 (NRG1), a factor known to be involved in the assurance of normal development of the nervous system. During the study, made up using the double immunofluorescence technique, the presence of NRG1 in the ENS of the selected segment of porcine large intestine (caecum, ascending and descending colon) was observed in physiological conditions, as well as under the impact of low and high doses of bisphenol A (BPA) which is commonly used in the production of plastics. In control animals in all types of the enteric plexuses, the percentage of NRG1-positive neurons oscillated around 20% of all neurons. The administration of BPA caused an increase in the number of NRG1-positive neurons in all types of the enteric plexuses and in all segments of the large intestine studied. The most visible changes were noted in the inner submucous plexus of the ascending colon, where in animals treated with high doses of BPA, the percentage of NRG1-positive neurons amounted to above 45% of all neuronal cells.

We aimed to test the hypothesis that developmental exposure of California mice (Peromyscus californicus) to GEN, BPA, or both chemicals influences hypothalamic miR/small RNA profiles and ascertain the extent such biomolecular alterations correlate with behavioral and metabolic changes. California mice were developmentally exposed to GEN (250 mg/kg feed weight, FW), GEN (250 mg/kg FW)+BPA (5 mg/kg FW), low dose (LD) BPA (5 mg/kg FW), or upper dose (UD) BPA (50 mg/kg FW). Adult offspring were tested in a battery of behavioral and metabolic tests; whereupon, mice were euthanized, brains were collected and frozen, small RNAs were isolated from hypothalamic punches, and subsequently sequenced. California mice exposed to one or both EDCs engaged in one or more repetitive behaviors. GEN, LD BPA, and UD BPA altered aspects of ultrasonic and audible vocalizations. Each EDC exposure led to sex-dependent differences in differentially expressed miR/small RNAs with miR7-2, miR146, and miR148a being increased in all female and male EDC exposed groups. Current findings reveal that developmental exposure to GEN and/or BPA affects hypothalamic miR/small RNA expression patterns, and such changes correlate with EDC-induced behavioral and metabolic alterations. miR146 is likely an important mediator and biomarker of EDC exposure in mammals, including humans.",PMC7897400

Diet is the primary cause of human exposure to this contaminant. BPA promotes obesity by inducing adipocyte dysfunction and altering adipogenesis. Contradictory evidence and unanswered questions are reported in the literature concerning the BPA effects on adipogenesis. To clarify this issue, we tested the effects of prolonged low-dose BPA exposure on different phases of adipogenesis in committed 3T3L1 and uncommitted NIH3T3 preadipocytes. Our findings show that BPA effects on the adipogenesis are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms by reducing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (Pparγ) promoter methylation in preadipocytes. Nevertheless, in BPA-exposed 3T3L1, Pparγ expression only transiently increases as lipid accumulation at day 4 of differentiation, without altering the adipogenic potential of the precursor cells. In the absence of differentiation mix, BPA does not make the 3T3L1 an in vitro model of spontaneous adipogenesis and the effects on the Pparγ expression are still limited at day 4 of differentiation. Furthermore, BPA exposure does not commit the NIH3T3 to the adipocyte lineage, although Pparγ overexpression is more evident both in preadipocytes and during the adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, termination of the BPA exposure restores the Pparγ promoter methylation and inflammatory profile of the 3T3L1 cells. This study shows that BPA induces epigenetic changes in a key adipogenic gene. These modifications are reversible and do not affect preadipocyte commitment and/or differentiation. We identify an alternative transcriptional mechanism by which BPA affects gene expression and demonstrate how the challenge of preventing exposure is fundamental for human health.",PMC7696502

Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were chosen as target compounds to be quantified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), while the non-target screening was carried out by High Resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (HRGC-MS). The target analysis revealed concentrations of 16 priority Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA-PAHs) in the range of 29.9-269.1 ng/g; the quantification of 31 PCBs showed values from 0.54 to 15.3 ng/g, identifying CB-138, 153, 180, 52, and 101 primarily; and the detected OCPs (p,p'-DDT and its metabolites) ranged between 14.5 and 63.7 ng/g.

We hypothesized that associations of POPs with these gonadotropins could be modified by factors affecting endogenous hormones. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted on data from 89 postmenopausal women using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). POPs were summarized based on classification schemes thought to reflect toxicological properties. Associations of POPs and gonadotropin hormones were modeled with multivariable regression models.

Percentage interference (%ρ) on yeast aerobic mitochondrial catabolism was calculated after comparison of aerobic respiration of exposed and control S. cerevisiae cell suspensions. Results suggested the hypothesis of a dose-dependent co-action of two mechanisms, namely uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress. These mechanisms respectively matched with opposite effects of hyperstimulation and inhibition of cellular respiration. While uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and oxidative stress have been previously described as separate effects from in vitro BPA exposure using other biochemical endpoints and biological systems, effects of BPB on cellular aerobic respiration are here reported for the first time. Results highlighted a similar hyperstimulation effect after exposure to 5 µg/mL BPA and BPB. About a 2-fold higher cellular respiration inhibition potency was observed after exposures to 15, 30, and 100 µg/mL BPB compared to BPA. 2,4-Dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) was used as model uncoupling agent.

One of the most widely used and studied, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), has been labeled as an endocrine disruptor. The major and toxic metabolic derivative of DEHP, mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), is capable of interfering with mitochondrial function, but its mechanism of action on mitophagy remains elusive. Here, we report that MEHP exacerbates cytotoxicity by amplifying the PINK1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy pathway. First, MEHP exacerbated mitochondrial damage induced by low-dose CCCP via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and enhanced fragmentation in mitochondria. Second, co-exposure to MEHP and CCCP (""MEHP-CCCP"") induced robust mitophagy. Mechanistically, MEHP-CCCP stabilized PINK1, increased the level of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pSer 65-Ub), and led to Parkin mitochondrial translocation and activation. Third, MEHP-CCCP synergistically caused more cell death, while inhibition of mitophagy, either through chemical or gene silencing, reduced cell death. Finally and importantly, co-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) completely counteracted the effects of MEHP-CCCP, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS played a vital role in this process.

At outermost layer of the antral follicle, theca cells provide structural, steroidogenic, and vascular support. Inter- and extra-thecal GJIC is required for intrafollicular trafficking of signaling molecules. Because GJIC can be altered by hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), we tested if any of five common EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), bisphenol F (BPF), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and triphenyltin chloride (TPT)) can interfere with theca cell GJIC. Since most chemicals are reported to repress GJIC, we hypothesized that all chemicals tested, within environmentally relevant human exposure concentrations, will inhibit theca cell GJICs. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used a scrape loading/dye transfer assay. BPS, but no other chemical tested, enhanced GJIC in a dose- and time-dependent manner in ovine primary theca cells. A signal-protein inhibitor approach was used to explore the GJIC-modulatory pathways involved. Phospholipase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors significantly attenuated BPS-induced enhanced GJIC. Human theca cells were used to evaluate translational relevance of these findings. Human primary theca cells had a ∼40% increase in GJIC in response to BPS, which was attenuated with a MAPK inhibitor, suggestive of a conserved mechanism. Upregulation of GJIC could result in hyperplasia of the theca cell layer or prevent ovulation by holding the oocyte in meiotic arrest.

It is also toxic to the brain, reproductive system, liver, and kidney. However, little is known about how DiNP impacts the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). It is crucial to understand how DiNP exposure affects the GIT because humans are primarily exposed to DiNP through the GIT. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that subacute exposure to DiNP dysregulates cellular, endocrine, and immunological aspects in the colon of adult female mice. To test this hypothesis, adult female mice were dosed with vehicle control or DiNP doses ranging from 0.02 to 200 mg/kg for 10-14 days. After the treatment period, mice were euthanized during diestrus, and colon tissue samples were subjected to morphological, biochemical, and hormone assays. DiNP exposure significantly increased histological damage in the colon compared to control. Exposure to DiNP also significantly decreased sICAM-1 levels, increased Tnf expression, decreased a cell cycle regulator (Ccnb1), and increased apoptotic factors (Aifm1 and Bcl2l10) in the colon compared to control. Colon-extracted lipids revealed that DiNP exposure significantly decreased estradiol levels compared to control. Collectively, these data indicate that subacute exposure to DiNP alters colon morphology and physiology in adult female mice.",PMC7608689

Our laboratory previously developed a relevant phthalate mixture consisting of six phthalates and found that it disrupted female fertility in mice. However, it is unknown if prenatal exposure to phthalate mixtures can accelerate reproductive aging and if this occurs in multiple generations. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to a mixture of phthalates accelerates biomarkers of reproductive aging in multiple generations of female mice. Pregnant CD-1 mice were orally dosed with vehicle control or a phthalate mixture (20 μg/kg/day-500 mg/kg/day) daily from gestational day 10 to birth. Adult F1 females born to these dams were used to create the F2 and F3 generations by mating them with unexposed males. At 13 months, estrous cyclicity was monitored and ovaries and sera were collected for analysis. In the F1 generation, the mixture decreased testosterone and inhibin B levels, but increased follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels compared to control. In the F2 generation, the phthalate mixture decreased the percent of antral follicles and testosterone hormone levels compared to control. In the F3 generation, prenatal exposure to the phthalate mixture increased ovarian weight, increased the time in metestrus/diestrus, altered follicle numbers, and decreased the levels of luteinizing hormone compared to control. Collectively, these data suggest that prenatal exposure to a phthalate mixture may accelerate several biomarkers of reproductive aging in a multi- and transgenerational manner in female mice.",PMC7736276

For this purpose, the effects of GLP1R agonist on various atherogenesis-related cellular processes and pathways were assessed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). DEHP-induced cell proliferation and migration were significantly decreased by GLP1R agonist in VSMCs. Protein levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were significantly decreased in cells exposed to GLP1R agonist, compared with DEHP-treated cells. Expression levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 were also reduced in GLP1R agonist-treated cells. Similarly, DEHP-associated phosphorylation of protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was decreased in GLP1R agonist-treated cells, compared with DEHP-treated cells.

This difficulty is particularly problematic for cosmetic ingredients, because in vivo testing is now banned completely in the European Union. The aim was to identify candidate preservatives as endocrine disruptors by in silico methods and to confirm endocrine receptors' activities through nuclear receptors in vitro. We screened preservatives listed in Annex V in the European Union Regulation on cosmetic products to predict their binding to nuclear receptors using the Endocrine Disruptome and VirtualToxLab™ version 5.8 in silico tools. Five candidate preservatives were further evaluated for androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptor (ERα), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and thyroid receptor (TR) agonist and antagonist activities in cell-based luciferase reporter assays in vitro in AR-EcoScreen, hERα-HeLa-9903, MDA-kb2, and GH3.TRE-Luc cell lines. Additionally, assays to test for false positives were used (nonspecific luciferase gene induction and luciferase inhibition). Triclocarban had agonist activity on AR and ERα at 1μM and antagonist activity on GR at 5μM and TR at 1μM. Triclosan showed antagonist effects on AR, ERα, GR at 10μM and TR at 5μM, and bromochlorophene at 1μM (AR and TR) and at 10μM (ERα and GR).

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is the predominant form in human samples and has been shown to induce severe health consequences, such as neonatal mortality, neurotoxicity, and immunotoxicity. Toxicological studies indicate that PFAS accumulate in bone tissues and cause altered bone development. Epidemiological studies have reported an inverse relationship between PFAS and bone health, however the associated mechanisms are still unexplored. Here, we present computational, in silico and in vitro evidence supporting the interference of PFOA on vitamin D (VD). First, PFOA competes with calcitriol on the same binding site of the VD receptor, leading to an alteration of the structural flexibility and a 10% reduction by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Second, this interference leads to an altered response of VD-responsive genes in two cellular targets of this hormone, osteoblasts and epithelial cells of the colorectal tract. Third, mineralization in human osteoblasts is reduced upon coincubation of PFOA with VD. Finally, in a small cohort of young healthy men, PTH levels were higher in the exposed group, but VD levels were comparable. Altogether these results provide the first evidence of endocrine disruption by PFOA on VD pathway by competition on its receptor and subsequent inhibition of VD-responsive genes in target cells.",PMC7545187

In birds, effects are similar to those caused by other xenoestrogens. Because of its endocrine disrupting activity, BPA is being substituted with other bisphenols in many applications. Using the chicken embryo model, we explored whether the BPA alternatives bisphenol AF (BPAF), bisphenol F (BPF), and bisphenol S (BPS) can induce effects on reproductive organ development similar to those induced by BPA. Embryos were exposed in ovo from embryonic day 4 (E4) to vehicle, BPAF at 2.1, 21, 210, and 520 nmol/g egg, or to BPA, BPF, or BPS at 210 nmol/g egg and were dissected on embryonic day 19. Similar to BPA, BPAF and BPF induced testis feminization, manifested as eg testis-size asymmetry and ovarian-like cortex in the left testis. In the BPS-group, too few males were alive on day 19 to evaluate any effects on testis development. We found no effects by any treatment on ovaries or Müllerian ducts. BPAF and BPS increased the gallbladder-somatic index and BPAF, BPF and BPS caused increased embryo mortality. The overall lowest-observed-adverse-effect level for BPAF was 210 nmol/g egg based on increased mortality, increased gallbladder-somatic index, and various signs of testis feminization. This study demonstrates that the BPA replacements BPAF, BPF, and BPS are embryotoxic and suggests that BPAF is at least as potent as BPA in inducing estrogen-like effects in chicken embryos. Our results support the notion that these bisphenols are not safe alternatives to BPA.",PMC7706397

In Florida, toxaphene and other organochlorine pesticides were used heavily in agriculture on the north shore of Lake Apopka and they are still detectable in soil. Wild largemouth bass that inhabit the lake and the marshes along the north shore have been exposed to a variety of organochlorine pesticides including dieldrin, methoxychlor, and p,p'-DDE, among others. While these other organochlorine pesticides have been studied for their endocrine disrupting effects in largemouth bass, there is little information for toxaphene. In this study, male and female largemouth bass were given food containing 50 mg/kg toxaphene for almost 3 months, to achieve tissue levels similar to those found in fish at Lake Apopka. Sex-specific toxicity was then evaluated by measuring various reproductive endpoints and transcriptomic changes. In females, gonadosomatic index showed a trend towards reduction (p = 0.051) and plasma vitellogenin was reduced by ~40% relative to controls. However plasma levels of 17β-estradiol and testosterone were not perturbed by toxaphene exposure. These data suggest that toxaphene does not act as a weak estrogen as many other organochlorine pesticides do, but rather appears to be acting as an antiestrogen in female fish. There were no obvious changes in the gonadosomatic index and plasma hormones in male bass. However, ex vivo explant experiments revealed that toxaphene prevented human chorionic gonadotropin-stimulated testosterone production in the testis. This suggested that toxaphene had anti-androgenic effects in males. Subsequent transcriptomic analyses of the testis revealed that androgen receptor/beta-2-microglobulin signaling was up-regulated while insulin-related pathways were suppressed with toxaphene, which could be interpreted as a compensatory response to androgen suppression. In the male liver, the transcriptome analysis revealed an overwhelming suppression in immune-related signaling cascades (e.g. lectin-like receptor and ITSM-Containing Receptor signaling, CD16/CD14 Proinflammatory Monocyte Activation, and CD38/CD3-JUN/FOS/NF-kB Signaling in T-cell Proliferation). Overall, this study showed that toxaphene induced sex-specific effects.

A potential limitation to the use of in vitro assay data in regulatory decision-making is the lack of coverage for xenobiotic metabolic processes. Both hepatic- and peripheral-tissue metabolism can yield metabolites that exhibit greater activity than the parent compound (bioactivation) or are inactive (bioinactivation) for a given biological target. Interpretation of biological effect data for both putative endocrine active substances, as well as other chemicals, screened in HTS assays may benefit from the addition of xenobiotic metabolic capabilities to decrease the uncertainty in predicting potential hazards to human health. The objective of this study was to develop an approach to retrofit existing HTS assays with hepatic metabolism. The Alginate Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) platform encapsulates hepatic S9 fractions in alginate microspheres attached to 96-well peg lids. Functional characterization across a panel of reference substrates for phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed substrate depletion with expected metabolite accumulation.

Of the thousands of chemicals present in the environment, those with adverse effects on the endocrine system are referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Here, we focused on a subclass of EDCs that impacts the estrogen receptor (ER), a pivotal transcriptional regulator in health and disease. Estrogenic activity of compounds can be measured by many in vitro or cell-based high throughput assays that record various endpoints from large pools of cells, and increasingly at the single-cell level. To simultaneously capture multiple mechanistic ER endpoints in individual cells that are affected by EDCs, we previously developed a sensitive high throughput/high content imaging assay that is based upon a stable cell line harboring a visible multicopy ER responsive transcription unit and expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of ER. High content analysis generates voluminous multiplex data comprised of minable features that describe numerous mechanistic endpoints. In this study, we present a machine learning pipeline for rapid, accurate, and sensitive assessment of the endocrine-disrupting potential of benchmark chemicals based on data generated from high content analysis. The multidimensional imaging data was used to train a classification model to ultimately predict the impact of unknown compounds on the ER, either as agonists or antagonists. To this end, both linear logistic regression and nonlinear Random Forest classifiers were benchmarked and evaluated for predicting the estrogenic activity of unknown compounds. Furthermore, through feature selection, data visualization, and model discrimination, the most informative features were identified for the classification of ER agonists/antagonists. The results of this data-driven study showed that highly accurate and generalized classification models with a minimum number of features can be constructed without loss of generality, where these machine learning models serve as a means for rapid mechanistic/phenotypic evaluation of the estrogenic potential of many chemicals.",PMC7538107

The algal acute biotoxicity results showed that the 24h-EC50 of DBP for C. vulgaris was 4.95 mg L-1, which caused a decrease in the chlorophyll a content and an increase in the DBP concentration of C. vulgaris. Proteomic analysis led to the identification of 1257 C. vulgaris proteins. Sixty-one more proteins showed increased expression, compared to proteins with decreased expression. This result illustrates that exposure to DBP generally enhances protein expression in C. vulgaris. GO annotation showed that both acetolactate synthase (ALS) and GDP-L-fucose synthase 2 (GER2) decreased more than 1.5-fold after exposure to DBP.

Crossbreeding of fish in F2 generation indicated subfertility in males. To further understand the mechanisms underlying BPA or EE2-induced adult onset and transgenerational reproductive defects in males, the present study examined the expression of genes regulating the brain-pituitary-testis (BPT) axis in the same F0 and F2 generation male medaka. Embryonic exposure to BPA or EE2 led to hyperactivation of brain and pituitary genes, which are actively involved in reproduction in adulthood of the F0 generation male fish, and some of these F0 effects continued to the F2 generation (transgenerational effects). Particularly, the F2 generation inherited the hyperactivated state of expression for kisspeptin (kiss1 and kiss2) and their receptors (kiss1r and kiss2r), and gnrh and gnrh receptors. At F2 generation, expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (dnmt1) decreased in brain of the BPA treatment lineage, while EE2 treatment lineage showed increased dnmt3bb expression.

In particular, exposure of the developing testis to exogenous estrogen can negatively impact male reproductive health. To determine how estrogens impact human gonad function, we treated the human testis-derived cell line NT2/D1 with estrogen and examined its impact on SOX9 and the expression of key markers of granulosa (ovarian) and Sertoli (testicular) cell development. Estrogen successfully activated its cognate receptor (estrogen receptor alpha; ESR1) in NT2/D1 cells. We observed a significant increase in cytoplasmic SOX9 following estrogen treatment. After 48 h of estrogen exposure, mRNA levels of the key Sertoli cell genes SOX9, SRY, AMH, FGF9 and PTGDS were significantly reduced. This was followed by a significant increase in mRNA levels for the key granulosa cell genes FOXL2 and WNT4 after 96 h of estrogen exposure. These results are consistent with estrogen's effects on marsupial gonads and show that estrogen has a highly conserved impact on gonadal cell fate decisions that has existed in mammals for over 160 million years.

Fetal/early life exposures permanently affect neurobehavioral functions that deteriorate with age; BPA exposure may compound the effects of aging.",PMC7609133

Here, we determined that benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), a common EDC and food packaging plasticizer, mixed into chow diet (CD) and high fat diets (HFD) at varying concentrations (4 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day, 169 μg/kg bw/day, 3 mg/kg bw/day, 50 mg/kg bw/day) produced a number of detrimental and sex-specific metabolic effects in C57BL/6 male and female mice after 16 weeks. Male mice exposed to moderate (3 mg/kg bw/day) concentrations of BBP in an HFD were especially affected, with significant increases in body weight due to significant increases in weight of liver and adipose tissue. Other doses did not show any significant changes when compared to only CD or HFD alone. HFD in the presence of 3 mg/kg bw/day BBP showed significant increases in fasting blood glucose, glucose intolerance, and insulin intolerance when compared to HFD alone. Furthermore, this group significantly alters transcriptional regulators involved in hepatic lipid synthesis and its downstream pathway. Interestingly, most of the BBP doses had no phenotypic effect when mixed with CD and compared to CD alone. The female mice did not show a similar response as the male population even though they consumed a similar amount of food. Overall, these data establish a dose which can be used for a BBP-induced metabolic research model and suggest that a moderate dosage level of EDC exposure can contribute to widely ranging metabolic effects.",PMC7467250

Our previous studies in mice show disruption of metabolic health upon maternal BPA exposure. The current study was undertaken to determine whether exposure in fathers causes adverse metabolic consequences in offspring. Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to BPA in the diet beginning at 5 weeks of age resulting in the following dietary exposure groups: Control (0 μg/kg/day), Lower BPA (10 μg/kg/day) and Upper BPA (10 mg/kg/day). After 12 weeks of dietary exposure, males were mated to control females. Mothers and offspring were maintained on the control diet. Post-pubertal paternal BPA exposure did not affect offspring body weight, body composition or glucose tolerance. However, when fathers were exposed to BPA during gestation and lactation, their female offspring displayed impaired glucose tolerance in the absence of compromised in vivo insulin sensitivity or reduced ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Male offspring exhibited normal glucose tolerance. Taken together, these studies show there is an early window of susceptibility in which paternal BPA exposure can cause sex-specific impairments in glucose homeostasis.",PMC7554185

The relationship between DEHP and AR is still inconclusive. This study aims to investigate the effect of environmental pollutants DEHP on AR. By examining DEHP metabolites in the urine of AR patients and building an AR model. 24 BALB/c mice were used as the study subjects, and ovalbumin (OVA) and DEHP (3 mg/kg/body) were used for intragastric administration. They were divided into control group, DEHP group, OVA group and OVA + DEHP group. Examination, behavioral scoring, inflammatory factor testing, oxidative stress testing, detection of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and signaling pathways CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 related proteins and mRNA. The concentrations of 3 metabolites of DEHP (MEHHP, MEOHP, and MEHP) in urine of AR patients were higher. And HE-staining showed that for the control group, many chronic inflammatory cell infiltration and nasal mucosal destruction were observed in the OVA + DEHP group and were more severe than the OVA group. Allergic symptom scores were obtained from sneezing, scratching, number of scratching, and nose flow. The scores of the OVA group and the OVA + DEHP group were higher than 7 points. Serum ELISA and nasal mucosal oxidative stress tests are more serious in the OVA + DEHP group. The expression of AhR protein and its mRNA was increased in the DEHP group, OVA group and OVA + DEHP group. The OVA + DEHP group was more significant in the OVA group and DEHP group. And the mRNAs of the AhR-related signaling pathways CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were also more prominent in the OVA + DEHP group. DEHP may aggravate its inflammatory response through the AhR pathway closely related to the environment. When combined with OVA, DEHP can further aggravate the OVA-induced nasal inflammatory response and make the nasal cavity have undergone severe changes, and many inflammatory cells have infiltrated.

Many peer-reviewing studies have reported adverse effects of low dose BPA exposure, particularly during perinatal period (gestation and/or lactation). We previously demonstrated that perinatal oral exposure to BPA (via gavage of mothers during gestation and lactation) has long-term consequences on immune response and intestinal barrier functions. Due to its adverse effects on several developmental and physiological processes, BPA was removed from consumer products and replaced by chemical substitutes such as BPS or BPF, that are structurally similar and not well studied compare to BPA. Here, we aimed to compare perinatal oral exposure to these bisphenols (BPs) at two doses (5 and 50 μg/kg of body weight (BW)/day (d)) on immune response at intestinal and systemic levels in female offspring mice at adulthood (Post Natal Day PND70). Pregnant female mice were orally exposed to BPA, BPS or BPF at 5 or 50 μg/kg BW/d from 15th day of gravidity to weaning of pups at Post-Natal Day (PND) 21. Humoral and cellular immune responses of adult offspring (PND70) were analysed at intestinal and systemic levels. In female offspring, perinatal oral BP exposure led to adverse effects on intestinal and systemic immune response that were dependant of the BP nature (A, S or F) and dose of exposure. Stronger impacts were observed with BPS at the dose of 5 μg/kg BW/d on inflammatory markers in feces associated with an increase of anti-E. coli IgG in plasma. BPA and BPF exposure induced prominent changes at low dose in offspring mice, in term of intestinal and systemic immune responses, provoking an intestinal and systemic Th1/Th17 inflammation. These findings provide, for the first time, results of long-time consequences of BPA, S and F perinatal exposure by oral route on immune response in offspring mice. This work warns that it is mandatory to consider immune markers and dose exposure in risk assessment associated to new BPA's alternatives.",PMC7457519

Studies suggest that prenatal and early childhood exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be associated with ADHD, but the association during adolescence has not been studied to date. To evaluate the association between exposure to select endocrine-disrupting chemicals during adolescence and ADHD-related behaviors. For this cross-sectional analysis, data were collected from 205 adolescents in the New Bedford Cohort, an ongoing prospective birth cohort, between June 18, 2011, and June 10, 2014. The adolescents provided spot urine samples and underwent neurodevelopmental testing. Statistical analyses performed from January 15 to December 31, 2019, used a repeated-measures analysis with multivariate modified Poisson models to estimate the adjusted relative risk of ADHD-related behaviors associated with exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Urinary biomarker concentrations of endocrine-disrupting chemicals or their metabolites, including phthalates, parabens, phenols, and triclocarban, were quantified. Summary exposure measures were created, combining biomarker concentrations of chemicals with a shared mechanism of action, exposure pathway, or chemical class. Behaviors related to ADHD were assessed with up to 14 indices from self-, parent-, and teacher-completed behavioral checklists using validated and standardized instruments; specifically, the Conners Attention Deficit Scale and the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition. Scores on each index were dichotomized to identify those with evidence of a significant behavioral problem, defined by each scale's interpretive guidelines. Among the 205 participants, the mean (SD) age at assessment was 15.3 (0.7) years, with 112 girls (55%) and 124 non-Hispanic White participants (61%). The median urine concentrations were 0.45 μmol/L of Σantiandrogenic phthalates, 0.13 μmol/L of ΣDEHP metabolites, 0.49 μmol/L of Σpersonal care product phthalates, 0.35 μmol/L of Σparabens, 0.02 μmol/L of Σbisphenols, and 0.02 μmol/L of Σdichlorophenols. A total of 82 (40%) had scores consistent with a significant behavioral problem, whereas 39 (19%) had an ADHD diagnosis. Each 2-fold increase in the sum of antiandrogenic phthalate concentrations was associated with a 1.34 (95% CI, 1.00-1.79) increase in the risk of significant ADHD-related behavior problems, whereas a 2-fold increase in the sum of dichlorophenols was associated with a 1.15 (95% CI, 1.01-1.32) increased risk. These associations tended to be stronger in male participants, but comparisons of sex-specific differences were imprecise.

Biometric, hormonal, gene expression, and histopathological analysis were investigated. Testosterone, progesterone, and zeranol residues were detected at (0.12-3.44 µg/L) in water samples of different sites. Bisphenol-A (BPA) exhibited a very high concentration (6.5 µg/mL) in water samples from S1. Testosterone, 17β-estradiol residues were detected in fish tissues from all sites at (0.16-3.8 µg/Kg) and (1.05-5.01 µg/Kg), respectively. BPA residues were detected at a very high concentration in the liver and muscle of fish collected from S1 at higher levels of 25.9 and 48.07 µg/Kg, respectively.

This broad influence has implications for processes such as wound healing, which is modulated by the immunological response of the body. Conversely, while PCBs can be linked to diminished wound healing, outside of PCB pollution systems, exercise has been shown to accelerate wound healing. However, the potential for moderate intensity exercise to modulate or offset the harmful effects of a toxin like PCB are yet unknown. A key aim of the present study was to examine how PCB exposure at different doses (0, 100, 500, 1000 ppm i.p.) altered wound healing in exercised versus non-exercised subgroups of mice. We examined PCB effects on immune function in more depth by analyzing the concentrations of cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in these wounds inflicted by punch biopsy. Mice were euthanized at Day 3 or Day 5 after PCB injection (n = 3-6) and skin excised from the wound area was homogenized and analyzed for cytokine content. Results revealed that wound healing was not signficantly impacted by either PCB exposure or exercise, but there were patterns of delays in healing that depended on PCB dose. Changes in cytokines were also observed and depended on PCB dose and exercise experience. For example, IL-1β concentrations in Day 5 mice without PCB administration were 33% less in exercised mice than mice not exercised. However, IL-1β concentrations in Day 3 mice administered 100 ppm were 130% greater in exercised mice than not exercisedmice. Changes in the other measured cytokines varied with mainly depressions at lesser PCB doses and elevations at higher doses. Exercise had diverse effects on cytokine levels, but increased cytokine levels in the two greater doses. Explanations for these diverse effects include the use of young animals with more rapid wound healing rates less affected by toxin exposure, as well as PCB-mediated compensatory effects at specific doses which could actually enhance immune function. Future work should examine these interactions in more detail across a developmental time span. Understanding how manipulating the effects of exposure to environemntal contaminants using behavioral modification could be very useful in certain high risk populations or exposed individuals.",PMC7444807

No significant differences in testosterone, free testosterone, FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone, or SHBG were found between the ADHD group and controls among either boys or girls. Among boys with ADHD, urine MBzP and MEHP levels were positively correlated with serum testosterone levels. Among girls, urine MEP levels were positively correlated with serum LH, testosterone, and free testosterone levels. The findings suggest that the possibility of an adverse impact of EDCs on gonadal hormones and neurodevelopment may exist.

These regions were selected because of their important roles in the control of sociosexual behaviors that are perturbed in adulthood by prenatal EDC exposure. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to PCBs from Embryonic Day 8 (E8) to E18, encompassing the period of neurogenesis of all hypothalamic neurons. To determine the birth dates of neurons, bromo-2-deoxy-5-uridine (BrdU) was administered to dams on E12, E14, or E16. On the day after birth, male and female pups were perfused, brains immunolabeled for BrdU, and numbers of cells counted. In the VMN, exposure to PCBs significantly advanced the timing of neurogenesis compared to vehicle-treated pups, without changing the total number of BrdU+ cells. In the POA, PCBs did not change the timing of neurogenesis nor the total number of cells born. This is the first study to show that PCBs can shift the timing of neurogenesis in the hypothalamus, specifically in the VMN but not the POA.

In this study, three pesticides, glyphosate, thiacloprid, and imidacloprid, were tested for their ability to interfere with estrogen biosynthesis and/or signaling, to evaluate their potential action as EDCs. Among the tested compounds, only glyphosate inhibited aromatase activity (up to 30%) via a non-competitive inhibition or a mixed inhibition mechanism depending on the concentration applied. Then, the ability of the three pesticides to induce an estrogenic activity was tested in MELN cells. When compared to 17β-estradiol, thiacloprid and imidacloprid induced an estrogenic activity at the highest concentrations tested with a relative potency of 5.4 × 10-10 and 3.7 × 10-9, respectively. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations predicted the potential binding sites and the binding mode of the three pesticides on the structure of the two key targets, providing a rational for their mechanism as EDCs.

In contrast, methylation of several promoter regions was found to be associated with two or more EDCs, overlap with known gene-chemical interactions, and form a core network with genes known to be important for puberty. Furthermore, children with the highest yearly mean of dichotomized urinary phthalate metabolite levels were associated with higher promoter methylation of the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 6 gene (TRIP6), which again was mirrored by lower circulating TRIP6 protein levels.

However, abnormalities in the proportions of germ cells were observed until F2. Exposure of the male mice (F0) to BPA alters the morphology of the testis along with the association of germ cells and stemness properties of SSCs, with the effects persisting up to F2.

Here we used a murine model to test the acute effects of four ubiquitous environmental toxins: bisphenol A (BPA), di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), and dimethyl phthalate (DMP) on sperm fertilizing ability and pre-implantation embryo development. The most potent of these toxins, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), was further evaluated for its effect on sperm ion channel activity, capacitation status, acrosome reaction and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). DEHP demonstrated a profound hazardous effect on sperm fertility by producing an altered capacitation profile, impairing the acrosome reaction, and, interestingly, also increasing ROS production.

Interestingly, males exposed to EDCs had normal Fos expression in this region, suggesting that other neurons and/or brain regions mediate these effects. The high conservation of hormonal, olfactory, and behavioral traits necessary for reproductive success means that EDC contamination and its ability to alter these traits has widespread effects on wildlife and humans.",PMC7448938

The investigator-initiated studies were focused on integrating disease-associated, molecular, and physiological endpoints previously found by academic scientists into an industry standard guideline-compliant toxicity study. Thus, the goal of this collaboration was to provide a more comprehensive dataset upon which to base safety standards and to determine whether industry-standard tests are as sensitive and predictive as molecular and disease-associated endpoints. The goal of this report is to integrate the findings from the investigator-initiated studies into a comprehensive overview of the observed impacts of BPA across the multiple organs and systems analyzed. For each organ system, we provide the rationale for the study, an overview of methodology, and summarize major findings. We then compare the results of the CLARITY-BPA studies across organ systems with the results of previous peer-reviewed studies from independent labs. Finally, we discuss potential influences that contributed to differences between studies. Developmental exposure to BPA can lead to adverse effects in multiple organs systems, including the brain, prostate gland, urinary tract, ovary, mammary gland, and heart. As published previously, many effects were at the lowest dose tested, 2.5μg/kg /day, and many of the responses were non-monotonic. Because the low dose of BPA affected endpoints in the same animals across organs evaluated in different labs, we conclude that these are biologically - and toxicologically - relevant.",PMC7365109

Increased exposure to PCBs is associated with adverse health consequences throughout life, including type 2 diabetes and cancer. PCB exposure is also associated with alterations in epigenetic marks and gene transcription, which could lead to adverse health outcomes, but many of these are population-specific. To further investigate the association between PCB and epigenetic marks, DNA methylation was measured at 787,684 CpG sites in 641 peripheral blood samples from the Michigan Polybrominated Biphenyl (PBB) Registry. 1345 CpGs were associated with increased total PCB level after controlling for age, sex, and 24 surrogate variables (FDR < 0.05). These CpGs were enriched in active promoter and transcription associated regions (p < 0.05), and in regions around the binding sites for transcription factors involved in xenobiotic metabolism and immune function (FDR < 0.05). PCB exposure also associated with proportions of CD4T, NK, and granulocyte cell types, and with the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.05), and the estimated effect sizes of PCB on the epigenome were correlated with the effect sizes previously reported in an epigenome-wide study of C-reactive protein (r = 0.29; p = 2.22e-5), supporting previous studies on the association between PCB and immune dysfunction. These results indicate that PCB exposure is associated with differences in epigenetic marks in active regions of the genome, and future work should investigate whether these may mediate the association between PCB and health consequences.",PMC7901541

Bisphenols were present in 47% of the samples, with BPC and BPM being the most frequently detected (23% and 25% of all samples, respectively). The mean concentrations of urinary BPS and BPF were greater than that of BPA. This contrasts with data reported previously. Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed a significant and negative correlation between urinary BPM concentration and the population's age.

However, the epigenetic toxicity is less understood in the liver. In this study, CD-1 mice were prenatally exposed to 20 μg/kg/day, 200 μg/kg/day, 500 mg/kg/day, or 750 mg/kg/day DEHP from gestational day (GD) 10.5 until birth of pups. Following prenatal exposure, the multigenerational and transgenerational effects of mRNA expression of epigenetic regulators were evaluated in F1, F2, and F3 generation mouse livers at postnatal days (PNDs) 8 and 60. Results showed that DEHP exposed mice livers exhibited significant changes in global DNA methylation levels in all three generations, with the effect being different in F2 after high dosage exposure. Histopathology indicated that DEHP exposure could induce mild damage in F1 livers. The expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) were significantly changed in both the F1 and F2 generations at PND 8, suggesting that maintenance Dnmt1 plays a major role in the multigenerational effect that occur in the early developmental stages. Additionally, DEHP exposure caused significant changes in ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine (Tet) dioxygenases encoding Tet1 expression in all three generations and Tet2 expression in F3 at PND 60, implicating their contributions in inducing both multi- and transgenerational effects after DEHP exposure in mouse liver.

Bisphenol A (BPA) and 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) are ubiquitous EDCs in the environment. Many aquatic organisms, including fish, are often exposed to varying concentrations of BPA and EE2 throughout their lifespan. Both BPA and EE2 can activate estrogenic signaling pathways and cause adverse effects on reproduction via alteration of pathways associated with steroidogenesis. However, transcriptional pathways that are affected by chronic exposure to these two ubiquitous environmental estrogens during embryonic, larval, and juvenile stages are not clearly understood. In the present study, we examined transcriptional alterations in the testis of medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) chronically exposed to a low concentration of BPA or EE2. Medaka were exposed to BPA (10 μg/L) or EE2 (0.01 μg/L) from 8 h post-fertilization (as embryos) to adulthood 50 days post fertilization (dpf), and transcriptional alterations in the testis were examined by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Transcriptomic profiling revealed 651 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BPA-exposed and control testes, while 1475 DEGs were found between EE2-exposed and control testes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed a significant enrichment of ""intracellular receptor signaling pathway"", ""response to steroid hormone"" and ""hormone-mediated signaling pathway"" in the BPA-induced DEGs, and of ""cilium organization"", ""microtubule-based process"" and ""organelle assembly"" in the EE2-induced DEGs.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of various doses of BPA on nitrergic nerves supplying the uterus with the double immunofluorescence method. It has been shown that even low doses of BPA caused an increase in the number of nitrergic nerves in the uterine wall and changed their neurochemical characterization. During the present study, changes in the number of nitrergic nerves simultaneously immunoreactive to substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, and/or cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript were found under the influence of BPA.

However, how these two EDCs would affect fetal rat testis development at a low dose was rarely studied. In this study, we established the organ culture system and applied it to evaluate testicular effects following multiple EDC exposure at a low dose. 15.5 days postcoitum fetal rat testes were dissected, cultured, and exposed to vehicle (control), GEN (1 μmol/L, G), MEHP (1 μmol/L, M), or GEN (1 μmol/L)+MEHP (1 μmol/L, G+M). Testicular cell markers, testosterone concentration, redox state, testicular histology, and testicular ultrastructure were evaluated. Our results showed that a low dose of MEHP suppressed the development of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and gonocytes by triggering oxidative injuries, which was consistent with the ultrastructural findings. However, coadministration of genistein at a low dose could partially attenuate MEHP-induced fetal testis damage through antioxidative action. Cotreatment of genistein at a low dose may have a promising future on its protecting role for attenuating other EDC-induced reproductive disorders during early life. Based on the results, it can be speculated that dietary intake of isoflavones may make the fetal testis less susceptible to phthalate-induced injury.",PMC7275205

However, the effect directly on human sperm function is not known. The CatSper Ca2+ channel in human sperm controls important sperm functions and is necessary for normal male fertility. Environmental chemicals have been shown to activate CatSper and thereby affect Ca2+ signaling in human sperm. BPA has previously been investigated for effects on Ca2+ signaling human sperm, whereas the effects of other BPA analogs are currently unknown. The aim of this study is thus to characterize the effect of BADGE, BPA, and the eight analogs BPG, BPAF, BPC, BPB, BPBP, BPE, BPF, BPS on Ca2+ signaling, and CatSper in human sperm. Methods: Direct effects of the bisphenols on Ca2+ signaling in human sperm cells were evaluated using a Ca2+ fluorimetric assay measuring changes in intracellular Ca2+. Effects via CatSper were assessed using the specific CatSper inhibitor RU1968. Effects on human sperm function was assessed using an image cytometry-based acrosome reaction assay and the modified Kremer's sperm-mucus penetration assay. Results: At 10 μM the bisphenols BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP induced Ca2+ signals in human sperm cells, whereas BPE, BPF, BPS, and BPA had no effect. The efficacy of the chemicals at 10 μM is BPG > BPAF > BPC > BADGE > BPB > BPBP. Dose-response relations of BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP yielded EC50-values in the nM-μM range. The induced Ca2+ signals were almost completely abolished using the CatSper inhibitor RU1968, indicating an effect of the bisphenols on CatSper. All bisphenols, except BPBP, were found to dose-dependently inhibit progesterone-induced Ca2+ signals, with BPG and BPAF displaying inhibition even in low μM doses. BPG and BPAF were shown to affect human sperm function in a progesterone-like manner. Conclusion: Our results show that the bisphenols BPG, BPAF, BPC, BADGE, BPB, and BPBP can affect Ca2+ signaling in human sperm cells through activation of CatSper. This could potentially disrupt human sperm function by interfering with normal CatSper-signaling and thus be a contributing factor in human infertility, either alone or in mixtures with other chemicals.",PMC7248311

Several PFAS have been identified as endocrine-disrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling. Experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that PFAS exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for women's health. This review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between PFAS exposure and ovarian function. A comprehensive review was performed by searching PubMed. Search terms included an extensive list of PFAS and health terms ranging from general keywords (e.g. ovarian, reproductive, follicle, oocyte) to specific keywords (including menarche, menstrual cycle, menopause, primary ovarian insufficiency/premature ovarian failure, steroid hormones), based on the authors' knowledge of the topic and key terms. Clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of PFAS in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the blood-follicle barrier. Although some studies found no evidence associating PFAS exposure with disruption in ovarian function, numerous epidemiologic studies, mostly with cross-sectional study designs, have identified associations of higher PFAS exposure with later menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, longer cycle length, earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens. Adverse effects of PFAS on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models. Based on laboratory research findings, PFAS could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells, inducing thyroid hormone deficiency, antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus. The published literature supports associations between PFAS exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes; however, the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between PFAS exposure and ovarian disorders. Thus, more research is warranted. PFAS are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans. Moreover, susceptible groups, such as foetuses and pregnant women, may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include PFAS. However, the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community. To better understand the potential risk of PFAS on human ovarian function, additional experimental studies using PFAS doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required. Prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of PFAS exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality.",PMC7456353

A horizontal analytical method is preferred to elucidate the toxic effects of phthalates on human reproduction. Nevertheless, there are vast numbers of known phthalates and not all of their modes of action have been clarified. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer and has been the subject of numerous toxicological studies. However, few of these have reported on the toxic effects of DEHP, its metabolites, other phthalates, or mixtures on female reproduction. Acute and high doses of DEHP adversely affect uterine histology. Recently, it was disclosed that chronic exposures to low doses of DEHP have endocrine disruption efficacy. DEHP induces various cellular responses including modulation of the expression and regulation of steroid hormone receptors and transcription and paracrine factors. Uteri do not respond uniformly to DEHP exposure.

We hypothesized that early bisphenol A (BPA) and bisphenol S (BPS) exposures would be associated with sex-dependent changes in preschool executive function. A subsample of the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) cohort (n = 312) provided maternal second trimester (prenatal) and 3-month postpartum (postnatal) urine samples, from which BPA and BPS concentrations were quantified. When children were age 2 and 4, mothers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (BRIEF-P). Changes in standardized T scores on the BRIEF-P indexes of inhibitory self-control, flexibility, and emergent metacognition were investigated. Adjusted multivariate regression analyses showed that child sex modified the associations between maternal postnatal BPA and changes in executive function. Higher maternal postnatal BPA concentrations predicted increasing difficulties from age 2 to 4 in the domains of inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition in female, but not male children. The other bisphenol concentrations were not associated with changes in executive function. Due to the ubiquity of BPA exposure among breastfeeding women, these findings justify further investigation on the effects of postnatal bisphenol exposure on child cognitive development. Higher concentrations of maternal BPA at 3-month postpartum were associated with increasing difficulties in inhibitory self-control and emergent metacognition from age 2 to 4 in girls, but not boys. Prenatal BPA and prenatal/postnatal BPS were not significant predictors of changes in executive function in boys and girls. The current study extends previous research to show that maternal postnatal BPA could also impact child executive function.

EPA models have incorporated our high-content analysis-based green fluorescent protein estrogen receptor (GFP-ER): PRL-HeLa assay, which allows direct visualization of ER binding to DNA regulatory elements. Here, we characterize a modified functional assay based on the stable expression of a chimeric androgen receptor (ARER), wherein a region containing the native AR DNA-binding domain (DBD) was replaced with the ERα DBD (amino acids 183-254). We demonstrate that the AR agonist dihydrotestosterone induces GFP-ARER nuclear translocation, PRL promoter binding, and transcriptional activity at physiologically relevant concentrations (<1 nM). In contrast, the AR antagonist bicalutamide induces only nuclear translocation of the GFP-ARER receptor (at μM concentrations). Estradiol also fails to induce visible chromatin binding, indicating androgen specificity. In a screen of reference chemicals from the EPA and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the GFP-ARER cell model identified and mechanistically grouped activity by known (anti-)androgens based on the ability to induce nuclear translocation and/or chromatin binding. Finally, the cell model was used to identify potential (anti-)androgens in environmental samples in collaboration with the Houston Ship Channel/Galveston Bay Texas A&M University EPA Superfund Research Program.

Despite numerous studies establishing this linkage, the long-term molecular changes that predispose mammary cells to carcinogenic transformation are unknown. Herein, we investigated how endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) drive changes within the stroma that can contribute to breast cancer susceptibility. We utilized bisphenol A (BPA) as a model of estrogenic endocrine disruption to analyze the long-term consequences in the stroma. Deregulated genes were identified by RNA-seq transcriptional profiling of adult primary fibroblasts, isolated from female mice exposed to in utero BPA. Collagen staining, collagen imaging techniques, and permeability assays were used to characterize changes to the extracellular matrix. Finally, gland stiffness tests were performed on exposed and control mammary glands. We identified significant transcriptional deregulation of adult fibroblasts exposed to in utero BPA. Deregulated genes were associated with cancer pathways and specifically extracellular matrix composition. Multiple collagen genes were more highly expressed in the BPA-exposed fibroblasts resulting in increased collagen deposition in the adult mammary gland. This transcriptional reprogramming of BPA-exposed fibroblasts generates a less permeable extracellular matrix and a stiffer mammary gland. These phenotypes were only observed in adult 12-week-old, but not 4-week-old, mice. Additionally, diethylstilbestrol, known to increase breast cancer risk in humans, also increases gland stiffness similar to BPA, while bisphenol S does not. As breast stiffness, extracellular matrix density, and collagen deposition have been directly linked to breast cancer risk, these data mechanistically connect EDC exposures to molecular alterations associated with increased disease susceptibility. These alterations develop over time and thus contribute to cancer risk in adulthood.",PMC7201668

The major results include significant correlations between urinary phthalates indicating their common sources of exposure, the frequent use of deodorant was significantly associated with higher urinary miBP (p = 0.050) and mnBP (p = 0.028) and a weak inverse association was found for the use of make-up products with mBzP (p = 0.053). The frequent use of plastic food containers was significantly associated with urinary mEHP (p = 0.026), and a positive trend was noticed for mEHP in amniotic fluid (p = 0.093).

Studies suggest a link between perinatal BPA exposure and increased breast cancer risk, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of in utero BPA exposure on mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-erbB2 transgenic mice. Pregnant mice were subcutaneously injected with BPA (0, 50, 500 ng/kg and 250 µg/kg BW) daily between gestational days 11-19. Female offspring were examined for mammary tumorigenesis, puberty onset, mammary morphogenesis, and signaling in ER and erbB2 pathways. In utero exposure to low dose BPA (500 ng/kg) induced mammary tumorigenesis, earlier puberty onset, increased terminal end buds, and prolonged estrus phase, which was accompanied by proliferative mammary morphogenesis. CD24/49f-based FACS analysis showed that in utero exposure to 500 ng/kg BPA induced expansion of luminal and basal/myoepithelial cell subpopulations at PND 35. Molecular analysis of mammary tissues at PND 70 showed that in utero exposure to low doses of BPA induced upregulation of ERα, p-ERα, cyclin D1, and c-myc, concurrent activation of erbB2, EGFR, erbB-3, Erk1/2, and Akt, and upregulation of growth factors/ligands. Our results demonstrate that in utero exposure to low dose BPA promotes mammary tumorigenesis in MMTV-erbB2 mice through induction of ER-erbB2 crosstalk and mammary epithelial reprogramming, which advance our understanding of the mechanism associated with in utero exposure to BPA-induced breast cancer risk. The studies also support using MMTV-erbB2 mouse model for relevant studies.",PMC7247154

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of BPA on 17β‑estradiol (E2)‑mediated protection against liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and to identify the underlying mechanisms using a rat model. A total of 56 male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following seven groups: i) Sham; ii) I/R; iii) Sham + BPA; iv) I/R + BPA; v) I/R + E2; vi) I/R + E2 + BPA; and vii) I/R + E2 + BPA + losartan [LOS; an angiotensin II (Ang II) type I receptor (ATIR) antagonist]. A rat model of hepatic I/R injury was established by inducing hepatic ischemia for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h. When ischemia was induced, rats were treated with vehicle, E2, BPA or LOS. After 24 h of reperfusion, blood samples and hepatic tissues were collected for histopathological and biochemical examinations. The results suggested that 4 mg/kg BPA did not significantly alter the liver function, or Ang II and AT1R expression levels in the Sham and I/R groups. However, 4 mg/kg BPA inhibited E2‑mediated hepatic protection by enhancing hepatic necrosis, and increasing the release of alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin (P<0.05). Moreover, BPA increased serum and hepatic Ang II levels, as well as AT1R protein expression levels in the E2‑treated rat model of liver I/R injury (P<0.05). LOS treatment reversed the negative effects of BPA on hepatic necrosis and liver serum marker levels, although it did not reverse BPA‑mediated upregulation of serum and hepatic Ang II levels, or hepatic AT1R expression. Therefore, the present study suggested that BPA disrupted E2‑mediated hepatic protection following I/R injury, but did not significantly affect healthy or I/R‑injured livers; therefore, the mechanism underlying the effects of BPA may be associated with upregulation of the Ang II/AT1R signaling pathway.",PMC7248534

Here, we further examined the behavioral effects of exposure to an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates at low doses during either perinatal development or adolescence. Using the elevated plus maze, adult females, not males, exposed to phthalates during adolescence showed indications of reduced anxiety-like behavior while perinatal exposed animals were unaffected. There was no effect of adolescent phthalate exposure on cognitive flexibility using the attentional set shift paradigm in either sex, unlike the impairments we have previously reported following perinatal exposure (Kougias et al., 2018b).

Pubertal male ICR mice were orally exposed to DEHP (0.18, 1.8, 18 and 180 mg/kg/d) for 3 weeks. In Open field test, DEHP significantly increased the time in central area staying and decreased the total distance and clockwise (CW) rotation of P-normal and P-T2DM mice. Morris water maze showed that DEHP significantly increased the latency in locating platform and decreased the original platform quadrant and residence time in target quadrant of P-normal and P-T2DM mice. Transcriptome analysis results revealed the effects of DEHP exposure on neural signaling pathway including biogenic amines neurotransmitters, nerve receptors, neurobiological processes, etc. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting results showed that DEHP significantly decreased the contents of 5-HT, cAMP, GABA and Ca2+, the levels of CREB, phosphorylation of PKA, ERK1/2 and CREB, increased the levels of CaM and phosphorylation of CaMKII in P-normal and P-T2DM mice. Factorial analysis results showed that P-T2DM mice were more sensitive than those of P-normal mice.

Two EDCs that have raised particular concerns are bisphenol A (BPA), a widely prevalent chemical in many common household items, and genistein (GEN), a phyto-oestrogen present in soy and other plants. We hypothesised that early exposure to BPA or GEN may lead to permanent effects on gene expression profiles for both coding RNAs (mRNAs) and microRNAs (miRs), which can affect the translation of mRNAs. Such EDC-induced biomolecular changes may affect behavioural and metabolic patterns. California mice (Peromyscus californicus) male and female offspring were developmentally exposed via the maternal diet to BPA (5 mg kg-1 feed weight low dose [LD] and 50 mg kg-1 feed weight upper dose [UD]), GEN (250 mg kg-1 feed weight) or a phyto-oestrogen-free diet (AIN) control. Behavioural and metabolic tests were performed at 180 days of age. A quantitative polymerase chain reacttion analysis was performed for candidate mRNAs and miRs in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. LD BPA and GEN exposed California mice offspring showed socio-communication impairments. Hypothalamic Avp, Esr1, Kiss1 and Lepr were increased in LD BPA offspring. miR-153 was elevated but miR-181a was reduced in LD BPA offspring. miR-9 and miR-153 were increased in the hippocampi of LD BPA offspring, whereas GEN decreased hippocampal miR-7a and miR-153 expression. Correlation analyses revealed neural expression of miR-153 and miR-181a was associated with socio-communication deficits in LD BPA individuals. The findings reveal a cause for concern such that developmental exposure of BPA or GEN in California mice (and potentially by translation in humans) can lead to long standing neurobehavioural consequences.",PMC7207022

They are able to produce many bioactive metabolites, some of which are potentially endocrine disrupting compounds, i.e., compounds that interfere with the hormonal systems of animals and humans. Endocrine disruptors represent potential risks to both environmental and human health, making them a global challenge. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential endocrine disrupting activities with emphasis on estrogenic effects of extracts from cultures of Microcystis or Planktothrix species. We also assessed the possible role of microcystins, some of the most studied cyanobacterial toxins, and thus included both microcystin-producing and non-producing strains. Extracts from 26 cyanobacterial cultures were initially screened in estrogen-, androgen-, and glucocorticoid-responsive reporter-gene assays (RGAs) in order to identify endocrine disruption at the level of nuclear receptor transcriptional activity. Extracts from selected strains were tested repeatedly in the estrogen-responsive RGAs, but the observed estrogen agonist and antagonist activity was minor and similar to that of the cyanobacteria growth medium control. We thus focused on another, non-receptor mediated mechanism of action, and studied the 17β-estradiol (natural estrogen hormone) biotransformation in human liver microsomes in the presence or absence of microcystin-LR (MC-LR), or an extract from the MC-LR producing M. aeruginosa PCC7806 strain. Our results show a modulating effect on the estradiol biotransformation.

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of ubiquitous contaminants that perturb endocrine signaling and have been associated with altered immune function in children. In this study, we examined the effects of developmental exposure to PCBs on neuroimmune responses to an inflammatory challenge during adolescence. Sprague Dawley rat dams were exposed to a PCB mixture (Aroclor 1242, 1248, 1254, 1:1:1, 20 μg/kg/day) or oil control throughout pregnancy, and adolescent male and female offspring were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 50 μg/kg, ip) or saline control prior to euthanasia. Gene expression profiling was conducted in the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and midbrain. In the hypothalamus, PCBs increased expression of genes involved in neuroimmune function, including those within the nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB) complex, independent of LPS challenge. PCB exposure also increased expression of receptors for dopamine, serotonin, and estrogen in this region. In contrast, in the prefrontal cortex, PCB exposure blunted or induced irregular neuroimmune gene expression responses to LPS challenge. Moreover, neither PCB nor LPS exposure altered expression of neurotransmitter receptors throughout the mesocorticolimbic circuit. Almost all effects were present in males but not females, in agreement with the idea that male neuroimmune cells are more sensitive to perturbation and emphasizing the importance of studying both male and female subjects. Given that altered neuroimmune signaling has been implicated in mental health and substance abuse disorders that often begin during adolescence, these results highlight neuroimmune processes as another mechanism by which early life PCBs can alter brain function later in life.",PMC7340239

The purpose of this study was to measure hormonal activity of substances leaching from toys and to identify potential endocrine disruptors causing that activity. For this purpose, migration experiments of toys were conducted in saliva simulants. The CALUX® assays were used to detect (anti-) estrogenic and (anti-) androgenic activity of 18 toys. Chemical trace analysis-namely, GC-MS and HPLC-MS- was used to identify which compounds may be responsible for endocrine activity in the sample migrates. Nine out of 18 tested toys showed significant estrogenic activity. For two samples, the detected estrogenic activity could be well explained by detecting the known endocrine active substance bisphenol A (BPA). For all identified substances, including BPA, a risk assessment for human health was performed by comparing the exposure dose, calculated based on the determined substance concentration, to toxicological reference values. Using worst-case scenarios, the exposure to BPA by mouthing of the two estrogen active, BPA-containing toys could be above the temporary TDI that EFSA has calculated. This demonstrates that some toys could significantly contribute to the total exposure to BPA of babies and infants.

Interestingly, the impacted future generations display a wide range of heterogeneity in their reproductive traits. In this study, the role that the Y chromosome plays in creating such heterogeneity is explored by testing the hypothesis that the Y chromosome serves as a carrier of the exposure impact to future generations. This hypothesis implies that a male who has a Y chromosome that is from a male that was exposed to an endocrine disruptor will display a more severe reproductive phenotype than a male whose Y chromosome is from an unexposed male. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model in which F1 generation animals were exposed prenatally to an endocrine disruptor, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and the severity of impacted reproductive traits was compared between the F3 generation males that were descendants of F1 males (paternal lineage) and those from F1 females (maternal lineage). Pregnant dams (F0 generation) were exposed to the vehicle or 20 or 200 μg/kg/day of DEHP from gestation day 11 until birth. Paternal lineage F3 DEHP males exhibited decreased fertility, testicular steroidogenic capacity, and spermatogenesis that were more severely impaired than those of maternal lineage males. Indeed, testicular transcriptome analysis found that a number of Y chromosomal genes had altered expression patterns in the paternal lineage males. This transgenerational difference in the DEHP impact can be attributed specifically to the Y chromosome.",PMC7109079

We examined associations of exposure to common endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy with weight from delivery through 1 year postpartum among 199 women in Mexico City. Materials and Methods: During each trimester of pregnancy, we collected a urine sample to assay bisphenol A (BPA), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP), and monoethyl phthalate (MEP). We calculated summary scores for di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP) and dibutyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDBP). We calculated the geometric mean of each EDC across pregnancy for use in the analysis. At delivery and three additional times during the first year postpartum, we measured the women's weight. We used mixed-effects linear regression models to estimate associations of each EDC with weight at delivery (kg) and weight change (kg/year) from delivery through 1 year postpartum. Covariates included urinary specific gravity, maternal age, parity, height, first trimester body mass index, and gestational age at enrollment. Results: Mean ± standard deviation weight change during the first postpartum year was -0.49 ± 4.04 kg. The EDCs were inversely associated with weight at delivery, but positively associated with weight change through 1 year postpartum. For example, each interquartile range of urinary ΣDEHP corresponded with 1.38 (95% confidence interval: 0.44-2.33) kg lower weight at delivery and 1.01 (0.41--1.61) kg/year slower rate of weight loss.

Because of the wide production and use of DEHP, humans are exposed to DEHP on a daily basis. Diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) is often used as a DEHP replacement chemical, and because of the increased use of DiNP, humans are increasingly exposed to DiNP over time. Of concern is that DEHP and DiNP both exhibit endocrine disrupting capabilities, and little is known about how short-term exposure to either of these phthalates affects aspects of female reproduction. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that short-term exposure to DEHP or DiNP during adulthood has long-lasting consequences on ovarian follicles and hormones in female mice. Female CD-1 mice aged 39-40 days were orally dosed with either vehicle control (corn oil), DEHP (20 μg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day), or DiNP (20 μg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day) for 10 days.

The adjusted ORs (95% CI) of diabetes comparing the 75th to 25th percentiles of each paraben/phenol were 1.09 (0.96-1.23) for BPA, 0.84 (0.72-0.98) for triclosan, 0.69 (0.61-0.79) for BP-3, 0.71 (0.61-0.83) for propyl paraben, 0.66 (0.54-0.80) for butyl paraben, 0.60 (0.51-0.71) for ethyl paraben, and 0.79 (0.68-0.91) for methyl paraben. Higher concentrations of triclosan, BP-3, and propyl, butyl, ethyl, and methyl parabens were associated with lower odds of diabetes. These findings warrant further investigation into the potential mechanism behind the observed associations and the temporal direction of the associations, given that we cannot rule out reverse causation.

In this study, coplanar PCB 126 (5 μmol/kg) or corn oil vehicle was administered to N = 5 and 6 male and female, wild type (WT) or AhR -/- rats via intraperitoneal injection. Animals were sacrificed after 4 weeks. Bone length was measured; bone morphology was assessed by microcomputed tomography and dynamic histomorphometry. Reduced bone length was the only genotype-specific effect and only observed in males (p < .05). WT rats exposed to PCB 126 had reduced serum calcium, and smaller bones with reduced tibial length, cortical area, and medullary area relative to vehicle controls (p < .05). Reduced bone formation rate observed in dynamic histomorphometry was consistent with inhibition of endosteal and periosteal bone growth. The effects of PCB 126 were abolished in AhR -/- rats. Gene expression in bone marrow and shaft were assessed by RNA sequencing. Approximately 75% of the PCB-regulated genes appeared AhR dependent with 89 genes significantly (p < .05) regulated by both PCB 126 and knockout of the AhR gene. Novel targets significantly induced by PCB 126 included Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf/Ccn2), which regulate chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in the bone growth plate and cell-matrix interactions. These data suggest the toxic effects of PCB 126 on bone are mediated by AhR, which has direct effects on the growth plate and indirect actions related to endocrine disruption.

As with other predators, seals are exposed to elevated bioaccumulated concentrations of PCBs and other persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Cryopreserved plasma samples from adult ringed (Phoca hispida; n = 39) and grey (Halichoerus grypus; n = 38) seals, sampled between 1998 and 2002 from Baltic Sea, Svalbard, and Sable Island (Canada) were used to investigate relationships between PCB exposure and sex hormone concentrations (progesterone; P4, 17α-hydroxy progesterone; 17α-OH-P4, testosterone; T4, 17β-estradiol; E2, estrone; E3). Immunoassay methods were used for quantification of analytes due to the limited sample volumes available. PCB concentrations were found to be significantly higher in Baltic seals than other sampling locations and were classed as ""Exposed"" seals while Svalbard and Sable Is seal were classed ""Reference"" seals (sexes and species separate). Mean hormone concentrations in Exposed seal were lower than Reference seals, and this was statistically significantly for 17α-OH-P4 (both sexes and both species), E2 (ringed and grey seal females), and E3 (grey seal females). Regression analyses (PCB v hormone concentrations) for each sex and species revealed significant correlations for P4 (Sable Is. female grey seals and female ringed seals), 17α-OH-P4 (Sable Is. male grey seals and Svalbard male ringed seals), T4 (Svalbard male ringed seals), E2 (female ringed seals), and E3 (female ringed seals and Baltic female grey seals). Although significant correlations are not evidence of cause and effect, the potential impact of hormone changes on endocrine homeostasis and reproductive health for seal populations warrants further investigation given that PCB concentrations found here are in the same range as those currently reported in seals from these populations.",PMC7136188
32105160,"Zhe Li, Cong Lyu, Yun Ren, Hailin Wang",Role of TET Dioxygenases and DNA Hydroxymethylation in Bisphenols-Stimulated Proliferation of Breast Cancer Cells.,2020,"Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous environmental endocrine disruptor targeting estrogen receptors (ERs), has been implicated in the promotion of breast cancer. Perinatal exposure of BPA could induce longitudinal alteration of DNA hydroxymethylation in imprinted loci of mouse blood cells. To date, no data has been reported on the effects of BPA on DNA hydroxymethylation in breast cells. Therefore, we asked whether BPA can induce DNA hydroxymethylation change in human breast cells. Given that dysregulated epigenetic DNA hydroxymethylation is observed in various cancers, we wondered how DNA hydroxymethylation modulates cancer development, and specifically, whether and how BPA and its analogs promote breast cancer development via DNA hydroxymethylation. We aimed to explore the interplay of the estrogenic activity of bisphenols at environmental exposure dose levels with TET dioxygenase-catalyzed DNA hydroxymethylation and to elucidate their roles in the proliferation of ER+ breast cancer cells as stimulated by environmentally relevant bisphenols. Human MCF-7 and T47D cell lines were used as ER-dependent breast cell proliferation models, and the human MDA-MB-231 cell line was used as an ER-independent breast cell model. These cells were treated with BPA or bisphenol S (BPS) to examine BPA/BPS-related proliferation. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were used to detect DNA hydroxymethylation. Crispr/Cas9 and RNA interference technologies, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot analyses were used to evaluate the expression and function of genes. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), bisulfite sequencing-PCR (BSP), and chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR) were used to identify the interactions of target proteins. We measured higher proliferation in ER+ breast cancer cells treated with BPA or its replacement, BPS, accompanied by an ERα-dependent decrease in genomic DNA hydroxymethylation. The results of our overexpression, knockout, knockdown, and inhibition experiments suggested that TET2-catalyzed DNA hydroxymethylation played a suppressive role in BPA/BPS-stimulated cell proliferation. On the other hand, we observed that TET2 was negatively regulated by the activation of ERα (dimerized and phosphorylated), which was also induced by BPA/BPS binding. Instead of a direct interaction between TET2 and ERα, data of our Co-IP, BSP, and ChIP-qPCR experiments indicated that the activated ERα increased the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT)-mediated promoter methylation of TET2, leading to an inhibition of the TET2 expression and DNA hydroxymethylation. We identified a new feedback circuit of ERα activation-DNMT-TET2-DNA hydroxymethylation in ER+ breast cancer cells and uncovered a pivotal role of TET2-mediated DNA hydroxymethylation in modulating BPA/BPS-stimulated proliferation. Moreover, to our knowledge, we for the first time established a linkage among chemical exposure, DNA hydroxymethylation, and tumor-associated proliferation. These findings further clarify the estrogenic activity of BPA/BPS and its profound implications for the regulation of epigenetic DNA hydroxymethylation and cell proliferation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5862.",PMC7064327

One possible approach to tackle MRA could be to cluster DNT chemicals in a mixture on the basis of their mode of action (MoA) into 'similar' and 'dissimilar', but still contributing to the same adverse outcome, and anchor DNT assays to common key events (CKEs) identified in DNT-specific adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). Moreover, the use of human in vitro models, such as induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal and glial cultures would enable mechanistic understanding of chemically-induced adverse effects, avoiding species extrapolation. HiPSC-derived neural progenitors differentiated into mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes were used to assess the effects of acute (3 days) and repeated dose (14 days) treatments with single chemicals and in mixtures belonging to different classes (i.e., lead(II) chloride and methylmercury chloride (heavy metals), chlorpyrifos (pesticide), bisphenol A (organic compound and endocrine disrupter), valproic acid (drug), and PCB138 (persistent organic pollutant and endocrine disrupter), which are associated with cognitive deficits, including learning and memory impairment in children. Selected chemicals were grouped based on their mode of action (MoA) into 'similar' and 'dissimilar' MoA compounds and their effects on synaptogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels, identified as CKEs in currently available AOPs relevant to DNT, were evaluated by immunocytochemistry and high content imaging analysis. Chemicals working through similar MoA (i.e., alterations of BDNF levels), at non-cytotoxic (IC20/100), very low toxic (IC5), or moderately toxic (IC20) concentrations, induce DNT effects in mixtures, as shown by increased number of neurons, impairment of neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis (the most sensitive endpoint as confirmed by mathematical modelling) and increase of BDNF levels, to a certain extent reproducing autism-like cellular changes observed in the brain of autistic children.

BPA is suspected to act through genomic and non-genomic pathways. However, its precise molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. Our goal was to identify and characterize a new molecular target of BPA in breast cancer cells in order to better understand how this compound may affect breast tumor growth and development. By using in vitro (MCF-7, T47D, Hs578t, and MDA-MB231 cell lines) and in vivo models, we demonstrated that PKD1 is a functional non-genomic target of BPA. PKD1 specifically mediates BPA-induced cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and anchorage-independent growth of breast tumor cells. Additionally, low-doses of BPA (≤10- 8 M) induced the phosphorylation of PKD1, a key signature of its activation state. Moreover, PKD1 overexpression increased the growth of BPA-exposed breast tumor xenografts in vivo in athymic female Swiss nude (Foxn1nu/nu ) mice. These findings further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of BPA. By defining PKD1 as a functional target of BPA in breast cancer cell proliferation and tumor development, they provide new insights into the pathogenesis related to the exposure to BPA and other endocrine disruptors acting similarly.",PMC7006487

To understand how BPA and the reputedly more inert bisphenol S (BPS) affect the placenta, C57BL6J mouse dams were fed 200 μg/kg body weight BPA or BPS daily for 2 wk and then bred. They continued to receive these chemicals until embryonic day 12.5, whereupon placental samples were collected and compared with unexposed controls. BPA and BPS altered the expression of an identical set of 13 genes. Both exposures led to a decrease in the area occupied by spongiotrophoblast relative to trophoblast giant cells (GCs) within the junctional zone, markedly reduced placental serotonin (5-HT) concentrations, and lowered 5-HT GC immunoreactivity. Concentrations of dopamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the main metabolite of serotonin, were increased. GC dopamine immunoreactivity was increased in BPA- and BPS-exposed placentas. A strong positive correlation between 5-HT+ GCs and reductions in spongiotrophoblast to GC area suggests that this neurotransmitter is essential for maintaining cells within the junctional zone. In contrast, a negative correlation existed between dopamine+ GCs and reductions in spongiotrophoblast to GC area ratio. These outcomes lead to the following conclusions. First, BPS exposure causes almost identical placental effects as BPA. Second, a major target of BPA/BPS is either spongiotrophoblast or GCs within the junctional zone. Third, imbalances in neurotransmitter-positive GCs and an observed decrease in docosahexaenoic acid and estradiol, also occurring in response to BPA/BPS exposure, likely affect the placental-brain axis of the developing mouse fetus.",PMC7060676

BPA, an endocrine disruptor, leads to alterations in reproductive function and therefore has been banned from the food industry. Unregulated BPA analogues, particularly Bisphenol S (BPS), have emerged and are now used in the plastic industry. Thus, this study aimed to examine the acute effects of low and environmental doses of BPS on ewe oocyte quality and developmental competence, and its mechanism of action, during in vitro maturation. Ewe cumulus-oocyte complexes underwent in vitro maturation in the presence or absence of BPS (1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 µM or 10 µM). Oocytes were then subjected to in vitro fertilisation and development. 1 µM BPS induced a 12.7% decrease in the cleavage rate (p = 0.004) and a 42.6% decrease in the blastocyst rate (p = 0.017) compared to control. The blastocyst rate reduction was also observed with 10 nM BPS. Furthermore, 10 µM BPS reduced the oocyte maturation rate, and 1 µM BPS decreased cumulus cell progesterone secretion. PR and AMH gene expression were reduced in cumulus cells. BPS induced a 5-fold increase in MAPK 3/1 activation (p = 0.04). BPS impaired ewe oocyte developmental competence.

We used high throughput in vitro bioactivity data and exposure predictions from the U.S. EPA's Toxicity and Exposure Forecaster (ToxCast and ExpoCast) to estimate combined estrogen receptor (ER) agonist activity of non-pharmaceutical chemical exposures for the general U.S. population. High-throughput toxicokinetic (HTTK) data provide conversion factors that relate bioactive concentrations measured in vitro (µM), to predicted population geometric mean exposure rates (mg/kg/day). These data were available for 22 chemicals with ER agonist activity and were estimated for other ER bioactive chemicals based on the geometric mean of HTTK values across chemicals. For each chemical, ER bioactivity across ToxCast assays was compared to predicted population geometric mean exposure at different levels of in vitro potency and model certainty. Dose additivity was assumed in calculating a Combined Exposure-Bioactivity Index (CEBI), the sum of exposure/bioactivity ratios. Combined estrogen bioactivity was also calculated in terms of the percent maximum bioactivity of chemical mixtures in human plasma using a concentration-addition model. Estimated CEBIs vary greatly depending on assumptions used for exposure and bioactivity. In general, CEBI values were <1 when using median of the estimated general population chemical intake rates, while CEBI were ≥1 when using the upper 95th confidence bound for those same intake rates for all chemicals. Concentration-addition model predictions of mixture bioactivity yield comparable results. Based on current in vitro bioactivity data, HTTK methods, and exposure models, combined exposure scenarios sufficient to influence estrogen bioactivity in the general population cannot be ruled out.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is classified as an EDC with xenoestrogenic activity with potentially adverse effects in reproduction. Currently, a significant knowledge gap remains regarding the complete spectrum of BPA-induced effects on the human placenta. As such, the present study examined the effects of physiologically relevant doses of BPA in vitro. qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, ELISA, microarray analyses, and bioinformatics have been employed to study the effects of BPA using nonsyncytialised (non-ST) and syncytialised (ST) BeWo cells. Treatment with 3 nM BPA led to an increase in cell number and altered the phosphorylation status of p38, an effect mediated primarily via the membrane-bound estrogen receptor (GPR30). Nonbiased microarray analysis identified 1195 and 477 genes that were differentially regulated in non-ST BeWo cells, whereas in ST BeWo cells, 309 and 158 genes had altered expression when treated with 3 and 10 nM, respectively. Enriched pathway analyses in non-ST BeWo identified a leptin and insulin overlap (3 nM), methylation pathways (10 nM), and differentiation of white and brown adipocytes (common). In the ST model, most significantly enriched were the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) pathway (3 nM) and mir-124 predicted interactions with cell cycle and differentiation (10 nM).

Although exogenous drivers (proteases, allergens) of epithelial barrier disruption and sensitization are well studied, endogenous contributors (diet, xenobiotics, hormones, and metabolism) to allergic sensitization are much less understood. Xenoestrogens are synthetic or natural chemical compounds that have the ability to mimic estrogen and are ubiquitous in the food and water supply of developed countries. By interfering with the estrogen produced by the endocrine system, these compounds have the systemic potential to disrupt the homeostasis of multiple tissues. Our study examined the potential of prototypical xenoestrogen bisphenol A (BPA) to disrupt epithelial homeostasis in vitro and promote allergic responses in vivo. We found that BPA exposure in epithelial cultures in vitro significantly inhibited epithelial cell proliferation and wound healing, as well as promoted the expression of the innate alarmin cytokine TSLP in a time-and dose-dependent manner. In vivo, the exposure to BPA through water supply or inhalation induced a systemic para-inflammatory response by promoting the expression of innate inflammatory mediators in the skin, gut, and airway. In a murine tolerogenic antigen challenge model, chronic systemic exposure to BPA was sufficient to induce airway sensitization to innocuous chicken egg ovalbumin in the complete absence of adjuvants.

Thus, exposure to spindle disrupting compounds can impair meiotic division and genomic stability in oocytes. The endocrine disrupting activity of bisphenols such as bisphenol A (BPA) is well recognized, yet their damaging effects on spindle microtubules (MTs) is poorly understood. Here, we tested the effect(s) of acute exposure to BPA and bisphenol F (BPF) on assembled spindle stability in ovulated oocytes. Brief (4 h) exposure to increasing concentrations (5, 25, and 50 µg/mL) of BPA or BPF disrupted spindle organization in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in significantly shorter spindles with highly unfocused poles and fragmented pericentrin. The chromosomes remained congressed in an abnormally elongated metaphase-like configuration, yet normal end-on chromosome-MT attachments were reduced in BPF-treated oocytes. Live-cell imaging revealed a rapid onset of bisphenol-mediated spindle MT disruption that was reversed upon compound removal. Moreover, MT stability and regrowth were impaired in BPA-exposed oocytes, with few cold-stable MTs and formation of multipolar spindles upon MT regrowth. MT-associated kinesin-14 motor protein (HSET/KIFC1) labeling along the spindle was also lower in BPA-treated oocytes. Conversely, cold stable MTs and HSET labeling persisted after BPF exposure. Notably, inhibition of Aurora Kinase A limited bisphenol-mediated spindle pole widening, revealing a potential interaction. These results demonstrate rapid MT disrupting activity by bisphenols, which is highly detrimental to meiotic spindle stability and organization.

Physiological levels of estrogen have been shown to stimulate DNA damage in breast epithelial cells through mechanisms mediated by estrogen-receptor alpha (ERα). Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) and propylparaben (PP) are xenoestrogens found in the urine of >96% of U.S. We investigated the effect of BP-3 and PP on estrogen receptor-dependent transactivation and DNA damage at concentrations relevant to exposures in humans. In human breast epithelial cells, DNA damage following treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2), BP-3, and PP was determined by immunostaining with antibodies against γ-H2AX and 53BP1. Estrogenic responses were determined using luciferase reporter assays and gene expression. Formation of R-loops was determined with DNA: RNA hybrid-specific S9.6 antibody. Short-term exposure to the chemicals was also studied in ovariectomized mice. Immunostaining of mouse mammary epithelium was performed to quantify R-loops and DNA damage in vivo. Concentrations of 1μM and 5μM BP-3 or PP increased DNA damage similar to that of E2 treatment in a ERα-dependent manner. However, BP-3 and PP had limited transactivation of target genes at 1μM and 5μM concentrations. BP-3 and PP exposure caused R-loop formation in a normal human breast epithelial cell line when ERα was introduced. R-loops and DNA damage were also detected in mammary epithelial cells of mice treated with BP-3 and PP. Acute exposure to xenoestrogens (PP and BP-3) in mice induce DNA damage mediated by formation of ERα-dependent R-loops at concentrations 10-fold lower than those required for transactivation. Exposure to these xenoestrogens may cause deleterious estrogenic responses, such as DNA damage, in susceptible individuals. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5221.",PMC7015622

We examined the association between maternal gestational concentrations of biomarkers of EDC exposure and telomere length at birth in the Harvard Epigenetic Birth Cohort. EDC (phenols and phthalates) biomarker concentrations were measured in maternal spot urine samples during the first trimester and telomere length in maternal and cord blood collected at delivery among 181 mother-newborn singleton dyads. Maternal and newborn telomere length exhibited a positive correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.20 (p-value< 0.01). Infant telomere length was associated with maternal biomarker concentrations of specific EDCs, and most of these associations were observed to be infant sex-specific. Prenatal exposure to triclosan, a non-paraben phenol with antimicrobial properties, was one of the most strongly associated EDCs with telomere length; telomere length was 20% (95% CI 5%-33%) shorter among boys in the highest quartile of maternal biomarker concentrations compared to the lowest quartile. In contrast, we observed longer telomere length associated with increased gestational concentrations of mono-isobutyl phthalate, and among boys, with increased concentrations of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate. In this birth cohort, we observed associations between maternal gestational exposure to select EDC biomarkers and telomere length, most of which were sex-specific.

However, little is known about late-life consequences due to DEHP or DiNP exposure during adulthood. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that adult exposure to DEHP or DiNP affects female reproductive parameters during late-life in female mice. Female CD-1 mice (age 39-40 days) were dosed with either vehicle control, DEHP (20 μg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day), or DiNP (20 μg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day) for 10 days and breeding trials were conducted at 12 and 15 months post-dosing. Further, ovaries and sera were collected at 12, 15, and 18 months post-dosing. DEHP and DiNP disrupted estrous cyclicity, increased pregnancy loss, decreased fertility, altered the sex ratio of pups, altered ovarian follicle populations, and disrupted hormone levels.

Traditional phthalic acid ester plasticizers (PAEs), such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and bis(2-ethyl hexyl) phthalate (DEHP), are now increasingly being replaced with more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC). While the metabolic pathways for PAE degradation have been established in the terrestrial environment, to our knowledge, the mechanisms for ATBC biodegradation have not been identified previously and plasticizer degradation in the marine environment remains underexplored. From marine plastic debris, we enriched and isolated microbes able to grow using a range of plasticizers and, for the first time, identified the pathways used by two phylogenetically distinct bacteria to degrade three different plasticizers (i.e., DBP, DEHP, and ATBC) via a comprehensive proteogenomic and metabolomic approach. This integrated multi-OMIC study also revealed the different mechanisms used for ester side-chain removal from the different plasticizers (esterases and enzymes involved in the β-oxidation pathway) as well as the molecular response to deal with toxic intermediates, that is, phthalate, and the lower biodegrading potential detected for ATBC than for PAE plasticizers. This study highlights the metabolic potential that exists in the biofilms that colonize plastics-the Plastisphere-to effectively biodegrade plastic additives and flags the inherent importance of microbes in reducing plastic toxicity in the environment.",PMC7031849

The aptamer was screened by a methodology involving reduced graphene oxide (rGO). As a result of screening and sequencing, a DNA aptamer was developed that recognizes the target with high binding affinity (Kd = 194.2 ± 65.9 nM) and specificity. The sensor system developed using the aptamer and gold nanoparticles is sensitive (LOD = 2.239 nM).

Meanwhile, six kinds of PAEs, including DEP, DMP, DBP, n-butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), were detected in PET bottled water, ranging from 0.19 μg/L to 0.98 μg/L, under an outdoor storage condition, while their concentrations ranged from 0.18 μg/L to 0.71 μg/L under an indoor storage condition. Furthermore, the concentrations of PAEs in brand D and E bottles were slightly increased when the storage time was prolonged. In addition, the concentrations of PAEs in commercial water contained in brand B and H bottles and pure water contained in brand E and G bottles were also slightly increased with the increase of storage temperature. Interestingly, DBP mainly contributed to the increased PAEs levels in simulation water. These results suggest that a part of the PAEs in PET bottled water originated from plastic bottles, which was related to the storage time and temperature.

While a large number of toxicological studies have investigated the effects of BPA, the potential effects of BPA exposure on fish brain have rarely been studied. To understand how BPA impacts goldfish brains, we performed a transcriptome analysis of goldfish brains that had been exposed to 50 μg L-1 and 0 μg L-1 BPA for 30 days. In the analysis of unigene expression profiles, 327 unigenes were found to be upregulated and 153 unigenes were found to be downregulated in the BPA exposure group compared to the control group. Dopaminergic signaling pathway-related genes were significantly downregulated in the BPA exposure group. Furthermore, we found that serum dopamine concentrations decreased and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 2-deoxyuridine, 5-triphosphate nick end labeling) staining was present in dopamine neurons enriched regions in the brain after BPA exposure, suggesting that BPA may disrupt dopaminergic processes. A KEGG analysis revealed that genes involved in the fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis pathway were highly significantly enriched. In addition, the qRT-PCR results for fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis pathway-related genes and the vascular histology of the brain showed that BPA exposure could damage blood vessels and induce brain atherosclerosis. The results of this work provide insights into the biological effects of BPA on dopamine synthesis and blood vessels in goldfish brain and could lay a foundation for future BPA neurotoxicity studies.",PMC6941070

After 4 weeks, rats were euthanized. PCB exposure resulted in hypocalcemia (P < 0.05) and significant increases in serum PTH without changes in serum phosphorous. Hyperparathyroidism was accompanied by increased expression of mRNAs of vitamin D3 metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP27B1 and CYP24 in the kidney (P < 0.05). PCB exposure also reduced body weight, serum IGF-1, and hepatic expression of mRNAs encoding the male-specific GH-pattern-regulated CYP2C11 and CYP3A2 relative to controls (P < 0.05). PCB exposure reduced long bone length, diameter, and surface area, but increased trabecular thickness and volume (P < 0.05).

Since this endocrine disruptor also displays genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects, it likely alters the spermatogenesis, a process in which both hormones and chromatin remodeling play crucial roles. The hypothesis of this work is that BPA impairs early embryo development by modifying the spermatic genetic and epigenetic information. Zebrafish males were exposed to 100 and 2000 μg/L BPA during early spermatogenesis and during the whole process. Genotoxic and epigenotoxic effects on spermatozoa (comet assay and immunocytochemistry) as well as progeny development (mortality, DNA repairing activity, apoptosis and epigenetic profile) were evaluated. Exposure to 100 µg/L BPA during mitosis slightly increased sperm chromatin fragmentation, enhancing DNA repairing activity in embryos. The rest of treatments promoted high levels of sperm DNA damage, triggering apoptosis in early embryo and severely impairing survival. Regarding epigenetics, histone acetylation (H3K9Ac and H3K27Ac) was similarly enhanced in spermatozoa and embryos from males exposed to all the treatments. Therefore, BPA male exposure jeopardizes embryonic survival and development due to the transmission of a paternal damaged genome and of a hyper-acetylated histone profile, both alterations depending on the dose of the toxicant and the temporal window of exposure.",PMC6889327

Pregnant female mice were exposed to a dose of 250 mg/kg/day/body weight of BPA in their drinking water. In adulthood, male offspring underwent intrascrotal inoculation with 4T1 cancer cells. On day 21 after inoculation, mice were euthanised, and serum was obtained to measure BPA levels using HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry.

Placentomes were collected during early (day 65) and mid (day 90) gestation (term ∼147 days) from control and BPA (gestational day 30-90)-treated pregnant sheep. BPA treatment: reduced placental efficiency and fetal weight; increased interleukin 8, lipid peroxidation marker, antioxidants, aromatase, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, estrogen receptor 2, insulin like growth factor (IGF) 2 receptor and IGF binding proteins (IGFBP), and histone deacetylase 1 and 2; reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha and IGF1 receptor at early gestation (Day 65).

These findings indicate that gestational BPA, either acting directly or by altering steroidal input, produces early/mid-gestational-specific epigenetic changes culminating in placental disruptions at several levels, in keeping with time-specific/time-lagged pregnancy-associated changes in placental efficiency and fetal weight. The reduced early-gestational placental efficiency may be a function of increased inflammation/oxidative stress and reduced IGF bioavailability with the mid-gestational restoration of placental efficiency likely driven by improved IGF bioavailability and the time-lagged response to antioxidant increase. This compensation, the result of time-lagged response to increases in negative mediators of placental function must have failed with pregnancy advancement to explain the low birthweight outcome.",PMC7243413

Yet, disparate results have been reported, with BPA advancing, delaying, or being neutral in its effects on puberty onset. Likewise, mechanistic analyses addressing the central and peripheral actions/targets of BPA at puberty remain incomplete and conflictive. We aimed to provide a comprehensive characterization of the impact of early BPA exposures, especially at low, real-life doses, on the postnatal development of hypothalamic Kiss1/NKB neurons, and its functional consequences on female pubertal maturation. Pregnant CD1 female mice were orally administered BPA at 5, 10, or 40μg/kg body weight (BW)/d from gestational day 11 to postnatal day 8 (PND8). Vaginal opening, as an external marker of puberty onset, was monitored daily from PND19 to PND30 in the female offspring. Blood and brain samples were collected at PND12, 15, 18, 21, and 30 for measuring circulating levels of gonadotropins and analyzing the hypothalamic expression of Kiss1/kisspeptin and NKB. Perinatal exposure to BPA, in a range of doses largely below the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL; 5mg/kg BW/d, according to the FDA), was associated with pubertal differences in the female progeny compared with those exposed to vehicle alone, with an earlier age of vaginal opening but consistently lower levels of circulating luteinizing hormone. Mice treated with BPA exhibited a persistent, but divergent, impairment of Kiss1 neuronal maturation, with more kisspeptin cells in the rostral (RP3V) hypothalamus but consistently fewer kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Detailed quantitative analysis of the ARC population, essential for pubertal development, revealed that mice treated with BPA had persistently lower Kiss1 expression during (pre)pubertal maturation, which was associated with lower Tac2 (encoding NKB) levels, even at low doses (5μg/kg BW/d), in the range of the tolerable daily intake (TDI), recently updated by the European Food Safety Authority. Our data attest to the consistent, but divergent, effects of gestational exposures to low concentrations of BPA, via the oral route, on phenotypic and neuroendocrine markers of puberty in female mice, with an unambiguous impact on the developmental maturation not only of Kiss1, but also of the NKB system, both essential regulators of puberty onset. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5570.",PMC6867420

The results showed that the prepared carbon foam remove 93% of BPA (60 mg/L). The BPA equilibrium data obeyed the Liu isotherm, displaying a maximum uptake capacity of 323.0 mg/g at 20 °C. The calculated free enthalpy change (∆H° = - 4.8 kJ/mol) indicated the existence of physical adsorption between BPA and carbon foam. Avrami kinetic model was able to explain the experimental results. From the regeneration tests, we conclude that the prepared carbon foam has a good potential to be used as an economic and efficient adsorbent for BPA removal from contaminated water. Based on these results and the fact that the developed structured carbon foam is very easy to separate from treated water, it can serve as an interesting material for real water treatment applications.",PMC6875152

In North America, over 90% of the population has detectable levels of urinary BPA. Human epidemiological studies have reported adverse behavioral outcomes with BPA exposure in children, however, corresponding effects on children's brain structure have not yet been investigated. The current study examined the association between prenatal maternal and childhood BPA exposure and white matter microstructure in children aged 2 to 5 years, and investigated whether brain structure mediated the association between BPA exposure and child behavior. Participants were 98 mother-child pairs who were recruited between January 2009 and December 2012. Total BPA concentrations in spot urine samples obtained from mothers in the second trimester of pregnancy and from children at 3-4 years of age were analyzed. Children participated in a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at age 2-5 years (3.7 ± 0.8 years). Associations between prenatal maternal and childhood BPA and children's fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of 10 isolated white matter tracts were investigated, controlling for urinary creatinine, child sex, and age at the time of MRI. Post-hoc analyses examined if alterations in white matter mediated the relationship of BPA and children's scores on the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Prenatal maternal urinary BPA was significantly associated with child mean diffusivity in the splenium and right inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Splenium diffusivity mediated the relationship between maternal prenatal BPA levels and children's internalizing behavior (indirect effect: β = 0.213, CI [0.0167, 0.564]). No significant associations were found between childhood BPA and white matter microstructure. This study provides preliminary evidence for the neural correlates of BPA exposure in humans. Our findings suggest that prenatal maternal exposure to BPA may lead to alterations in white matter microstructure in preschool aged children, and that such alterations mediate the relationship between early life exposure to BPA and internalizing problems.",PMC6794724

In particular, the hormone balance during gestation is delicate, and disturbance may cause acute or chronic long-term health effects. A potential endocrine disruption may be provoked by in utero exposure to xenoestrogens mimicking endogenous estrogens. The mycoestrogen zearalenone (ZEN), a toxic fungal secondary metabolite and mycotoxin found frequently in food and feed, constitutes a prominent example. We performed a comprehensive assessment of the transfer as well as phase I and phase II metabolism of ZEN at the human placental barrier. Human placentas were perfused with 1μM (318μg/L) ZEN for 6 h. Samples from the maternal and fetal compartment, placental tissue, and fetal plasma were analyzed by a highly sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS assay to detect ZEN as well as nine key metabolites (α-zearalenol, β-zearalenol, zearalanone, α-zearalanol, β-zearalanol, ZEN-14-glucuronide, α-zearalenol-14-glucuronide, β-zearalenol-14-glucuronide, ZEN-14-sulfate). The model revealed a fast maternofetal transfer of ZEN across the human placental barrier. We also unraveled phase I and phase II metabolism of the parent toxin ZEN into the approximately 70-times more estrogenic α-zearalenol and the less active ZEN-14-sulfate conjugate, which are effectively released into the maternal and fetal circulation in considerable amounts. Our findings suggest that exposure to ZEN (such as through consumption of ZEN-contaminated cereal-based products) during pregnancy may result in in utero exposure of the fetus, not only to ZEN but also some of its highly estrogenically active metabolites. In the light of the known affinity of ZEN and potentially co-occurring xenoestrogens to the estrogen receptor, and our results demonstrating placental transfer of ZEN and its metabolites in an ex vivo model, we recommend further research and more comprehensive assessment of gestational exposures in women. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4860.",PMC6867367

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals corresponds with elevated risks of obesity, but the effects of these compounds on human cells remain largely undefined. Widespread use of bisphenol AF (BPAF) as a bisphenol A (BPA) alternative in the plastics industry presents unknown health risks. To this end, we discovered that BPAF interferes with the metabolic function of mature human adipocytes. Although 4-day exposures to BPAF accelerated adipocyte differentiation, we observed no effect on mature fat cell marker genes. Additional gene and protein expression analysis showed that BPAF treatment during human adipocyte differentiation failed to suppress the proinflammatory transcription factor STAT1. Microscopy and respirometry experiments demonstrated that BPAF impaired mitochondrial function and structure. To test the hypothesis that BPAF fosters vulnerabilities to STAT1 activation, we treated mature adipocytes previously exposed to BPAF with interferon-γ (IFNγ). BPAF increased IFNγ activation of STAT1 and exposed mitochondrial vulnerabilities that disrupt adipocyte lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Collectively, our data establish that BPAF activates inflammatory signaling pathways that degrade metabolic activity in human adipocytes. These findings suggest how the BPA alternative BPAF contributes to metabolic changes that correspond with obesity.",PMC6985838

Bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), which have been substituted for BPA in some consumer products, have also shown endocrine-disrupting effects in experimental models. However, the effects of BPF and BPS on fetal growth in humans are unknown. Our goal was to investigate trimester-specific associations of urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS with size at birth. The present study included 845 pregnant women from Wuhan, China (2013-2015), who provided one urine sample in each of the first, second, and third trimesters. Linear regressions with generalized estimating equations were applied to estimate trimester-specific associations of urinary bisphenol concentrations with birth weight, birth length, and ponderal index. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify potential critical windows of susceptibility to bisphenols by comparing the exposure patterns of newborns in the 10th percentile of each birth anthropometric measurement to that of those in the 90th percentile. Medians (25th-75th percentiles) of urinary concentrations of BPA, BPF, and BPS were 1.40 (0.19-3.85), 0.65 (0.34-1.39), and 0.38 (0.13-1.11) ng/mL, respectively. Urinary BPA concentrations in different trimesters were inversely, but not significantly, associated with birth weight and ponderal index. Urinary concentrations of BPF and BPS during some trimesters were associated with significantly lower birth weight, birth length, or ponderal index, with significant trend p-values (ptrend<0.05) across quartiles of BPF and BPS concentrations. The observed associations were unchanged after additionally adjusting for other bisphenols. In addition, newborns in the 10th percentile of each birth anthropometry measure had higher BPF and BPS exposures during pregnancy than newborns in the 90th percentile of each outcome. Prenatal exposure to BPF and BPS was inversely associated with size at birth in this cohort. Replication in other populations is needed. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4664.",PMC6867404

Animal and epidemiological studies suggest that epigenetic factors can transmit the pathologies transgenerationally. Paternal epigenetic effects can greatly impact offspring health. In this study and together with our previous report, we found that H2S donor Na2S and/or NH3 donor NH4Cl diminished mouse fertility, decreased spermatozoa concentration and motility, and impaired spermatogenesis in three consequent generations (F0, F1, and F2). In the current study, we found that DNA methylation, histone methylation, and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) were impaired by NH4Cl and/or Na2S in F0, F1, and F2 mouse testes. Moreover, NH4Cl and/or Na2S might act as environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals to decrease estrogen and testosterone in mouse blood. It has been reported that ERα signaling is intertwined together with DNA methylation and histone methylation, which plays very important roles in spermatogenesis. These data together indicate that the transgenerational disruption in spermatogenesis by NH4Cl and/or Na2S may be through ERα-related DNA methylation and histone methylation pathways. Therefore, we strongly recommend that greater attention should be paid to NH3 and/or H2S contamination to minimize their impact on human health especially spermatogenesis.",PMC6749155

All mice were subjected to ovariectomy for the induction of artificial menopause and then exposed to corn oil, DEHP, and estrogen for 2 months. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) of the bone and analysis of blood samples for bone markers were performed to observe the changes in bone metabolism. Osteocalcin level was decreased in the control, low-dose and high-dose DEHP group, the reduction width was greater in the high-dose DEHP group (-0.219 ng/mL) than control group (-0.077 ng/mL, P<0.05).

However, despite the role that the skeletal muscle plays in glucose homeostasis, it remains unknown whether gestational exposure to BPA, or its analog bisphenol S (BPS), impairs skeletal muscle development. We hypothesized that gestational exposure to BPA or BPS will impair fetal muscle development and lead to muscle-specific insulin resistance. To test this, pregnant sheep (n = 7-8/group) were exposed to BPA or BPS from gestational day (GD) 30 to 100. At GD120, fetal skeletal muscle was harvested to evaluate fiber size, fiber type, and gene and protein expression related to myogenesis, fiber size, fiber type, and inflammation. Fetal primary myoblasts were isolated to evaluate proliferation and differentiation. In fetal skeletal muscle, myofibers were larger in BPA and BPS groups in both females and males. BPA females had higher MYH1 (reflective of type-IIX fast glycolytic fibers), whereas BPS females had higher MYH2 and MYH7, and higher myogenic regulatory factors (Myf5, MyoG, MyoD, and MRF4) mRNA expression. No differences were observed in males. Myoblast proliferation was not altered in gestationally BPA- or BPS-exposed myoblasts, but upon differentiation, area and diameter of myotubes were larger independent of sex. Females had larger myofibers and myotubes than males in all treatment groups. In conclusion, gestational exposure to BPA or BPS does not result in insulin resistance in fetal myoblasts but leads to fetal fiber hypertrophy in skeletal muscle independent of sex and alters fiber type distribution in a sex-specific manner.",PMC6876539

Exposure was assessed using ExpoCast predictions. Though alternatives were rarely included in authoritative lists, predictive toxicology tools suggested that BPA alternatives may not be safer but paraben and phthalate alternatives may be safer.

In the current study, we used the brains of these F2 males to ascertain the underlying molecular changes in the hypothalamus related to these behavioral outcomes. Their progenitors were Sprague-Dawley rat dams, treated on pregnancy days 8 to 18 with one of three treatments: a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture, Aroclor 1221, selected because it is weakly estrogenic; the anti-androgenic fungicide vinclozolin (VIN); or the vehicle, 6% dimethylsulfoxide in sesame oil (VEH). In adulthood, F1 male and female offspring were bred with untreated partners to generate paternal or maternal lineages of the F2 offspring, the subjects of molecular work. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted in the medial preoptic area (POA) and the ventromedial nucleus (VMN) of the hypothalamus, selected for their roles in social and sexual behaviors.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most commonly environmental EDCs. As the nitric oxide (NO) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathways both contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension, we evaluated whether resveratrol, an antioxidant and an AHR antagonist, can prevent hypertension programmed by a maternal BPA and HF diet. Sixteen-week-old male rat offspring were assigned to six groups (n = 8 per group): Control, HF (D12331, Research Diets), BPA (50 μg/kg/day), HF + BPA, BPA + R (resveratrol 50mg/L in drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation), and HF + BPA + R. Maternal BPA exposure exacerbated hypertension programmed by HF consumption in adult male offspring, which was protected by maternal resveratrol therapy. The BPA and HF diet synergistically induced oxidative stress in offspring kidneys, which resveratrol treatment prevented. We observed that HF + BPA-induced programmed hypertension was associated with a decreased NO bioavailability, increased oxidative stress, and an activated AHR signaling pathway. The beneficial effects of resveratrol are relevant to restoring NO bioavailability, reducing oxidative stress, and antagonizing the AHR signaling pathway. Our results cast a new light on resveratrol as a reprogramming strategy to protect against hypertension programmed by combined BPA and HF exposure, but this strategy has yet to be translated into clinical applications.",PMC6770559

Pre-implantation and post-implantation urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA concentrations were measured in pooled urine samples designed to limit single-measure variability due to the likely episodic nature of these exposures and the short half-life of these compounds. We estimated associations between these exposure biomarkers early in pregnancy with length of gestation from implantation to spontaneous birth. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard of birth among 125 naturally-conceived, singleton live births with censoring for medical interventions that artificially shortened pregnancy. Higher concentrations of mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (a metabolite of di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)) during the pre-implantation window were associated with reduced probability of birth, i.e., longer gestations (hazard ratio (HR): 0.55, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.86; p = 0.01).

However, and despite the continuous increase of tumor cell-resistance to therapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin (DOX), information regarding BPA drug interactions is still scarce, although its potential role in chemo-resistance has been suggested. This study aims to assess the potential interactions between environmentally relevant levels of BPA and DOX at a therapeutic dosage on Hep-2 and MRC-5 cell lines transciptome. Transcriptional effects in key-player genes for cancer biology, namely c-fos, p21, and bcl-xl, were evaluated through qRT-PCR. The cellular response was analyzed after exposure to BPA, DOX, or co-exposure to both chemicals. Transcriptional analysis showed that BPA exposure induces upregulation of bcl-xl and endorses an antagonistic non-monotonic response on DOX transcriptional effects. Moreover, the BPA interaction with DOX on c-fos and p21 expression emphasize its cellular specificity and divergent effects. Overall, Hep-2 was more susceptible to BPA effects in a dose-dependent manner while MRC-5 transcriptional levels endorsed a non-monotonic response.

Here, we address the hypothesis that BPA interferes with the highly evolutionary conserved process of mitochondrial cholesterol transport, a crucial step in steroid hormone biosynthesis, by using the model organism C. elegans. We observed that embryonic lethality and germline apoptosis, hallmarks of BPA's reproductive toxicity in C. elegans, are fully rescued by low exogenous cholesterol supplementation. We also observed that increasing BPA concentrations proportionally reduced mitochondrial cholesterol levels. Mutants for strl-1 (ortholog of StAR), but not C41G7.9 (ortholog of TSPO), show reproductive defects similar to BPA's while BPA exposure in a strl-1 background did not worsen these effects. Finally, cholesterol supplementation rescued these defects for all strl-1 genotype/BPA combinations assessed. Together, these results uncover a novel mechanism underlying BPA's germline toxicity through the alteration of cholesterol transport.",PMC6885526

The aim of this study was to assess, for the first time, the exposure to BPA but also to its chlorinated derivatives (ClxBPA) (100 times more estrogenic than BPA) during OL-HDF. We demonstrated that BPA is transmitted by the different medical devices used in OL-HDF: ultrafilters, dialysis concentrate cartridges (and not only dialyzers, as previously described). Moreover, BPA has been found in dialysis water as well as in ultrapure dialysate and replacement fluid due to contamination of water coming from municipal network. Indeed, due to contaminations provided by both ultrafilters and water, high levels of BPA were determined in the infused replacement fluid (1033 ng.L-1) from the beginning of the session. Thus, our results demonstrate that dialysis water must be considered as an important exposure source to endocrine disruptors, especially since other micropollutants such as ClxBPA have also been detected in dialysis fluids. While assessment of the impact of this exposure remains to be done, these new findings should be taken into account to assess exposure risks in end-stage renal disease patients.",PMC6770677

The present study evaluated the effects of selected common environmental EDCs on secretion of inflammatory biomarkers by RAW264.7 cells. The EDCs investigated were Estradiol (E2), 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and Bisphenol A (BPA). To evaluate if the effects caused by EDCs were modulated by steroid hormone receptors, antagonists of estrogen and androgen receptors were used. The steroid receptor antagonists used were Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, and Flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist. Secretion of biomarkers of inflammation, namely nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), were monitored. The NO was determined using Griess reaction and IL-6 was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although 5 μg/mL E2, DHT, and BPA were not toxic to RAW264.7 cell cultures, the same treatments significantly (p < 0.001) reduced both NO and IL-6 secretion by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 cell cultures. The suppression of NO and IL-6 secretion indicate inhibition of inflammation by DHT, E2, and BPA. The inhibitory effects of DHT, E2 and BPA are partially mediated via their cellular receptors, because the effects were reversed by their respective receptor antagonists. Flutamide reversed the effects of DHT, while Tamoxifen reversed the effects of E2 and BPA. In conclusion, E2, BPA, and DHT inhibit the synthesis of inflammation biomarkers by LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The inhibitory effects of EDCs can be partially reversed by the addition of an estrogen receptor antagonist for E2 and BPA, and an androgenic receptor antagonist for DHT. The inhibition of inflammatory response in stimulated RAW264.7 cells may be a useful bioassay model for monitoring estrogenic and androgenic pollutants.",PMC6721122

Urinary concentrations of mono-benzyl (MBzP), mono-(3-carboxypropyl) (MCPP), mono-(carboxyisononyl) (MCNP), mono-(carboxyisoctyl) (MCOP), and four metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) (∑DEHP) phthalates and bisphenols A, F, and S were measured in spot urine samples. We estimated percent changes in natural log creatinine-standardized concentrations per 10% higher energy from ultra-processed food in covariate-adjusted multivariable linear regression models. We examined effect measure modification by age group, race/ethnicity, and poverty:income ratio and assessed associations with minimally processed food intake. In adjusted models, higher energy from ultra-processed food was associated with higher urinary concentrations of MCPP, MCNP, and MCOP but not MBzP, ∑DEHP, or bisphenols. Each 10% higher energy from ultra-processed food was associated with 8.0% (95% CI: 5.6%, 10.3%) higher urinary MCOP concentrations, with a stronger association among children than adolescents or adults. Ultra-processed sandwiches/hamburgers, French fries/other potato products, and ice cream/pops were associated with higher concentrations of multiple chemicals. Higher energy from minimally processed food was associated with lower concentrations of MCPP, MCNP, MCOP, and bisphenols A and F. Ultra-processed food consumption may increase exposure to currently used phthalates.

Case reports and in vitro estrogen and androgen receptor gene expression activities in human cell lines with essential oils. Three prepubertal girls and one boy with clinical evidence of estrogenic action and a history of continuous exposure to lavender-containing fragrances were studied. Breast growth dissipated in all patients with discontinuation of the fragranced products. Some of the components tested elicited estrogenic and antiandrogenic properties of varying degrees. We report cases of premature thelarche that resolved upon cessation of lavender-containing fragrance exposure commonly used in Hispanic communities. The precise developmental basis for such conditions could be multifactorial.

However, the biological actions and toxicity of those BPs are still relatively unknown. To address this data gap, we used in vitro cell models to evaluate the ability of 22 BPs to induce or inhibit estrogenic and androgenic activity.

Changes were discovered on progesterone, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in mouse serum, and on the apoptosis rate of ovarian granulosa cells. Prolonged exposure to DMP led to decreased secretion of FSH hormones and increased secretion of E2 and LH hormones. Furthermore, DMP interfered with the pituitary-ovary axis and increased the apoptosis rate of ovarian granulosa cells. Therefore, prolonged exposure to DMP is likely to have negative effects on reproduction and development.",PMC6628229

We hypothesized that the effect of prenatal exposure to environmentally relevant doses of BPA will be evident during fetal organogenesis and fetal/postnatal growth trajectory. Pregnant ewes were administered BPA subcutaneously from 30 to 90 days of gestation (term 147 days). Fetal organ weight, anthropometric measures, maternal/fetal hormones and postnatal growth trajectory were measured in both sexes. Gestational BPA administration resulted in higher accumulation in male than female fetuses only at fetal day 65, with minimal impact on fetal/maternal steroid milieu in both sexes at both time points. BPA-treated male fetuses were heavier than BPA-treated female fetuses at fetal day 90 whereas this sex difference was not evident in the control group. At the organ level, liver weight was reduced in prenatal BPA-treated female fetuses, while heart and thyroid gland weights were increased in BPA-treated male fetuses relative to their sex-matched control groups. Prenatal BPA treatment also altered the postnatal growth trajectory in a sex-specific manner. Males grew slower during the early postnatal period and caught up later. Females, in contrast, demonstrated the opposite growth trend. Prenatal BPA-induced changes in fetal organ differentiation and early life growth strongly implicate translational relevance of in utero contributions to reproductive and metabolic defects previously reported in adult female offspring.",PMC6810745

The current research aimed to evaluate the effect of BPA on the in vitro maturation (IVM) and subsequent embryo development of mouse oocytes following in vitro fertilization (IVF). IVM was performed in the presence of different concentrations (0, 20, 50, or 100 μg/mL) of BPA. Nuclear maturation, IVF efficiency and embryonic development were determined. The levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) in the BPA (50 μg/mL) group were evaluated. We explored the ability of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in the IVM medium to rescue the BPA-induced damage by examining changes in nuclear maturation, IVF rate, blastocyst formation, ROS levels and GSH content. Compared with the control, BPA (50 μg/mL) supplementation during oocyte IVM significantly inhibited nuclear maturation and decreased fertilization and blastocyst formation rates. In addition, BPA exposure increased ROS levels and decreased GSH content in oocytes. The addition of NAC weakened the BPA-induced suppression of nuclear maturation, relieved the BPA-induced downregulation of the fertilization and blastocyst formation rates, and mitigated the increased ROS levels and decreased GSH content. BPA affects mouse oocyte maturation and subsequent early embryonic developmental competence following IVF by increasing intracytoplasmic oxidative stress in mature oocytes. NAC can reduce these harmful effects to a certain extent.",PMC6647297

Human exposure to dibutyl phthalate (DBP) occurs via consumer products (7-10 μg/kg/day) and medications (1-233 μg/kg/day). Most DBP toxicity studies have focused on high supraphysiological exposure levels; thus, very little is known about exposures occurring at environmentally relevant levels. CD-1 female mice (80 days old) were treated with tocopherol-stripped corn oil (vehicle control) or DBP dissolved in oil at environmentally relevant (10 and 100 μg/kg/day) or higher (1000 μg/kg/day) levels for 30 days to evaluate effects on DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genes and folliculogenesis. DBP exposure caused dose-dependent effects on folliculogenesis and gene expression. Specifically, animals exposed to the high dose of DBP had more atretic follicles in their ovaries, while in those treated with environmentally relevant doses, follicle numbers were no different from vehicle-treated controls. DBP exposure significantly reduced the expression of DDR genes including those involved in homologous recombination (Atm, Brca1, Mre11a, Rad50), mismatch repair (Msh3, Msh6), and nucleotide excision repair (Xpc, Pcna) in a dose-specific manner. Interestingly, staining for the DNA damage marker, γH2AX, was similar between treatments. DBP exposure did not result in differential DNA methylation in the Brca1 promoter but significantly reduced transcript levels for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, Dnmt1, in the ovary. Collectively, these findings show that oral exposure to environmentally relevant levels of DBP for 30 days does not significantly impact folliculogenesis in adult mice but leads to aberrant ovarian expression of DDR genes.",PMC6930367

However, current toxicology testing does not thoroughly explore the endocrine disrupting effects of industrial chemicals, which may have low dose effects not predicted when determining the limit of toxicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the endocrine disrupting potential of a broad range of chemicals used in the petrochemical sector. Therefore, 139 chemicals were classified for reproductive toxicity based on the United Nations Globally Harmonized System for hazard classification. These chemicals were evaluated in PubMed for reported endocrine disrupting activity, and their endocrine disrupting potential was estimated by identifying chemicals with active nuclear receptor endpoints publicly available databases. Evaluation of ToxCast data suggested that these chemicals preferentially alter the activity of the estrogen receptor (ER). Four chemicals were prioritized for in vitro testing using the ER-positive, immortalized human uterine Ishikawa cell line and a range of concentrations below the reported limit of toxicity in humans. We found that 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol (BHT) and diethanolamine (DEA) repressed the basal expression of estrogen-responsive genes PGR, NPPC, and GREB1 in Ishikawa cells, while tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and 2,2'-methyliminodiethanol (MDEA) induced the expression of these genes. Furthermore, low-dose combinations of PCE and MDEA produced additive effects. All four chemicals interfered with estradiol-mediated induction of PGR, NPPC, and GREB1. Molecular docking demonstrated that these chemicals could bind to the ligand binding site of ERα, suggesting the potential for direct stimulatory or inhibitory effects.

Sufficient energy availability and adiposity contribute to early pubertal development, and environmental factors, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), may affect not only the control of energy balance, but also puberty and reproduction. EDCs are hormonally active substances that can perturb puberty by acting both peripherally on target organs, such as adipose tissue or adrenal glands, and/or centrally on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Depending on whether the exposure takes place earlier during fetal and neonatal life or later during early childhood, EDCs can lead to different outcomes through different mechanisms. Evidence of associations between exposures to EDCs and altered pubertal timing makes it reasonable to support their relationship. However, human epidemiologic data are limited or inconsistent and cannot provide sufficient evidence for a causal relationship between EDC exposure and changes in pubertal timing. Further investigation is warranted to determine the overall or different effects of EDCs exposure during prenatal or childhood windows on pubertal milestones and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, including epigenetic marks, whereby early-life exposure to EDCs affect the HPG-peripheral tissue axis.",PMC6603611

Ethinyl estradiol (0.5 μg/kg bw/day) was used as a reference estrogen. Animals of both sexes were sacrificed as juveniles and OTR expression assessed by receptor binding. Our results demonstrate prenatal exposure to BPA can eliminate sex differences in OTR expression in three hypothalamic regions, and that male OTR expression may be more susceptible. Our data also identify a sub-region of the BNST with sexually dimorphic OTR expression not previously reported in juvenile rats that is also susceptible to BPA.",PMC6750986

Few epidemiologic studies have examined the association of phenol biomarkers with breast cancer incidence and, to our knowledge, none have considered associations with mortality following breast cancer. We examined seven urinary phenol biomarkers in association with breast cancer incidence and subsequent mortality, and examined effect measure modification by body mass index (BMI). Participants included 711 women with breast cancer and 598 women without breast cancer who were interviewed for the population-based Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. Among women with breast cancer, phenol biomarkers were quantified in spot urine samples collected on average within three months of a first diagnosis of primary in situ or invasive breast cancer in 1996-1997. Women with breast cancer were monitored for vital status using the National Death Index. After a median follow-up of 17.6 years, we identified 271 deaths, including 98 deaths from breast cancer. We examined creatinine-corrected phenol concentrations and the sum of parabens (Σparabens) in association with breast cancer incidence using logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and with mortality using Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. We evaluated multiplicative effect measure modification using cross-product terms in nested models. The highest (vs lowest) quintiles of urinary methylparaben, propylparaben, and Σparabens were associated with risk of breast cancer with ORs ranging from 1.31 to 1.50. Methylparaben, propylparaben, and Σparabens were also associated with all-cause mortality HRs ranging from 0.68 to 0.77. Associations for breast cancer incidence were more pronounced among women with BMI < 25.0 kg/m2 than among women with BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2; however, associations for mortality were more pronounced among women with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 than among women with BMI < 25 kg/m2.

However, the mechanisms of action underlying the transgenerational toxicity of DEHP are not understood. Therefore, this study determined the effects of prenatal and ancestral DEHP exposure on various ovarian pathways in the F1, F2, and F3 generations of mice. Pregnant CD-1 dams were orally exposed to corn oil (vehicle control) or DEHP (20 μg/kg/day-750 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 10.5 until birth. At postnatal day 21 for all generations, ovaries were removed for gene expression analysis of various ovarian pathways and for 5-methyl cytosine (5-mC) quantification. In the F1 generation, prenatal DEHP exposure disrupted the expression of cell cycle regulators, the expression of peroxisome-proliferator activating receptors, and the percentage of 5-mC compared to control. In the F2 generation, exposure to DEHP decreased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, apoptosis factors, and ten-eleven translocation compared to controls. It also dysregulated the expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) factors. In the F3 generation, ancestral DEHP exposure decreased the expression of steroidogenic enzymes, PI3K factors, cell cycle regulators, apoptosis factors, Esr2, DNA methylation mediators, and the percentage of 5-mC compared to controls. Overall, the data show that prenatal and ancestral DEHP exposure greatly suppress gene expression of pathways required for folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis in the ovary in a transgenerational manner and that gene expression may be influenced by DNA methylation. These results provide insight into some of the mechanisms of DEHP-mediated toxicity in the ovary across generations.",PMC6708485

Bisphenol A (BPA), a well-studied xenoestrogen, is known to alter development of estrogen-sensitive organs including the brain, reproductive tract, and mammary gland. Bisphenol S (BPS; 4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol), which has a similar chemical structure to BPA, is also used in many consumer products, but its effects on estrogen-sensitive organs in mammals has not been thoroughly examined. Here, we quantified the effects of perinatal exposures to BPS on the male mouse mammary gland. In our first study, pregnant CD-1 mice were orally exposed to BPS (2 or 200 μg/kg/day) starting on pregnancy day 9 through lactation day 20, and male mammary glands were evaluated on embryonic day 16, prior to puberty, and in early adulthood. We observed modest changes in tissue organization in the fetal gland, and significant increases in growth of the gland induced by developmental BPS exposure in adulthood. In our second study, pregnant CD-1 mice were orally exposed to BPS (2, 200 or 2000 μg/kg/day) starting on pregnancy day 9 through lactational day 2. After weaning, the male pups were administered either oil (vehicle) or an estrogen challenge (1 μg ethinyl estradiol/kg/day) for ten days starting prior to puberty. After the 10-day estrogen challenge, we examined hormone-sensitive outcomes including anogenital index (AGI), weight of the seminal vesicles, and morphological parameters of the mammary gland. Although AGI and seminal vesicle weight were not affected by BPS, we observed dose-specific effects on the response of male mammary glands to the peripubertal estrogen challenge. Because male mammary glands are structurally less developed compared to females, they may provide a simple model tissue to evaluate the effects of putative xenoestrogens.",PMC6736534

Our aim was to identify the possible dysregulation of genes in PCB exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in order to give more insight into the differential pathophysiological effects of PCB congeners and mixtures, with an emphasis on immunological effects and oxidative stress. The PBMCs of a healthy volunteer (male, 56 years old) were exposed to a mixture of dioxin-like (DL)-PCBs (PCB 77, 81, 105, 114, 118, 123, 126, 156, 157, 167, 169, and 189, 250 µg/L resp.) or non-dioxin-like (NDL)-PCBs (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, 180, 250 µg/L resp.) or single PCB congener (no.28, 138, 153, 180, 250 µg/L resp.). After an incubation period of 24 h, a microarray gene expression screening was performed, and the results were compared to gene expression in control samples (PBMCs treated with the vehicle iso-octane). Treatment of PBMCs with the DL-PCB mixture resulted in the largest number of differentially regulated genes (181 upregulated genes >2-fold, 173 downregulated >2-fold). Treatment with the NDL-PCB mix resulted in 32 upregulated genes >2-fold and 12 downregulated genes >2-fold. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on DL-PCB treated PBMCs resulted in an upregulation of 125 gene sets and a downregulation of 76 gene sets. Predominantly downregulated gene sets were involved in immunological pathways (such as response to virus, innate immune response, defense response). An upregulation of pathways related to oxidative stress could be observed for all PCB congeners except PCB-28; the latter congener dysregulated the least number of genes. Our experiment augments the information known about immunological and cellular stress responses following DL- as well as NDL-PCB exposure and provides new information on PCB 28.

C57BL/6J mice prenatally exposed to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP develop a testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) at adulthood, but similarly-exposed FVB/N mice are not affected. Here we aim to understand the reasons behind this drastic difference that should depend on the genome of the strain. In both backgrounds, pregnant female mice received per os either DEHP or corn oil vehicle and the male filiations were examined. Computer-assisted sperm analysis showed a DEHP-induced decreased sperm count and velocities in C57BL/6J. Sperm RNA sequencing experiments resulted in the identification of the 62 most differentially expressed RNAs. These RNAs, mainly regulated by hormones, produced strain-specific transcriptional responses to prenatal exposure to DEHP; a pool of RNAs was increased in FVB, another pool of RNAs was decreased in C57BL/6J. In FVB/N, analysis of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) impacting SHP identified rs387782768 and rs29315913 respectively associated with absence of the Forkhead Box A3 (Foxa3) RNA and increased expression of estrogen receptor 1 variant 4 (NM_001302533) RNA. Analysis of the role of SNPs modifying SHP binding sites in function of strain-specific responses to DEHP revealed a DEHP-resistance allele in FVB/N containing an additional FOXA1-3 binding site at rs30973633 and four DEHP-induced beta-defensins (Defb42, Defb30, Defb47 and Defb48). A DEHP-susceptibility allele in C57BL/6J contained five SNPs (rs28279710, rs32977910, rs46648903, rs46677594 and rs48287999) affecting SHP and six genes (Svs2, Svs3b, Svs4, Svs3a, Svs6 and Svs5) epigenetically silenced by DEHP. Finally, targeted experiments confirmed increased methylation in the Svs3ab promoter with decreased SEMG2 persisting across generations, providing a molecular explanation for the transgenerational sperm velocity decrease found in C57BL/6J after DEHP exposure.

After 25 days, the serum was obtained, and the populations of B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes were analyzed by flow cytometry. The reactivity of IgM was evaluated by 2D immunoblots. No significant changes were found in the B cell populations in the peripheral lymph nodes and the spleen. The level of ERα expression was not significantly different. However, the IgM reactivity was affected. In individuals treated with BPA, a decrease in the number of IgMs that recognize tumor antigens was observed.

To better characterize the ability of exogenous compounds to bind and activate ERRγ, we used a combination of cell-based, biochemical, structural and computational approaches. A purposely created stable cell line allowed for the determination of the EC50s for over 30 environmental ERRγ ligands, including previously unknown ones. Interestingly, affinity constants (Kds) of the most potent compounds measured by isothermal titration calorimetry were in the 50-500 nM range, in agreement with their receptor activation potencies. Crystallographic analysis of the interaction between the ERRγ ligand-binding domain (LBD) and compounds of the bisphenol, alkylphenol and naphthol families revealed a partially shared binding mode and minimal alterations of the receptor conformation upon ligand binding. Further biophysical characterizations coupled to molecular dynamics simulations suggested a mechanism through which ERRγ ligands would exhibit their agonistic properties by preserving the transcriptionally active form of the receptor while rigidifying some loop regions with associated functions.

In this study, we investigate the dissolved organic matter (DOM) effect on the release and distribution of EDCs under varied hydrodynamic conditions. A water chamber mesocosm was designed to simulate the hydrodynamic forces in a shallow lake. The contents of bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenol (NP) in colloid-bound and soluble phases were measured under four increasing hydrodynamic intensities that were 5%, 20%, 50%, and 80% of the critical shear stress. The total BPA and NP contents in overlying water grew linearly with the hydrodynamic intensity (R2 = 0.997 and 0.987), from 108.28 to 415.92 ng/L of BPA and 87.73 to 255.52 ng/L of NP. The exponential relationships of EDC content and hydrodynamic intensity in soluble phase (R2 = 0.985 of BPA and 0.987 of NP) and colloid phase (R2 = 0.992 of BPA and 0.995 of NP) were also detected. The DOM concentrations in colloid-bound phase (cDOM) and in soluble phase (sDOM) were measured and the linear relationships with BPA content (R2 = 0.967 of cDOM and 0.989 of sDOM) and NP content (R2 = 0.978 of cDOM and 0.965 of sDOM) were detected. We analyzed the ratio (αDOM) of sDOM and cDOM that grew logarithmically with the hydrodynamic intensity (R2 = 0.999).

However, this single-compound approach neglects the fact that the mixture exposed to human may act additively or synergistically to induce greater toxicity than the single compounds exposure due to their similarities in the mode of action and targets. Mixture effects can occur even when all mixture components are present at levels that individually do not produce observable effects. So the individual chemical effect thresholds do not necessarily protect against combination effects, an understanding of the rules governing the interactive effects in mixtures is needed. The aim of the study was to test and analyze the individual and combined estrogenic effects of a mixture of three endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) in immature rats with mathematical models. In the present study, the data of individual estrogenic effects of BPA, NP and DES were obtained in uterotrophic bioassay respectively, the reference points for BPA, NP and DES were derived from the dose-response ralationship by using the traditional no observed adverse effect (NOAEL) or lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) methods, and the benchmark dose (BMD) method. Then LOAEL values and the benchmark dose lower confidence limit (BMDL10) of single EDCs as the dose design basis for the study of the combined action pattern. Mixed prediction models, the 3 × 2 factorial design model and the concentration addition (CA) model, were employed to analyze the combined estrogenic effect of the three EDCs. From the dose-response relationship of estrogenic effects of BPA, NP and DES in the model of the prepuberty rats, the BMDL10(NOAEL) of the estrogenic effects of BPA, NP and DES were 90(120) mg/kg body weight, 6 mg/kg body weight and 0.10(0.25) μg/kg body weight, and the LOAEL of the the estrogenic effects of three EDCs were 240 mg/kg body weight, 15 mg/kg body weight and 0.50 μg/kg body weight, respectively. At BMDL10 doses based on the CA concept and the factorial analysis, the mode of combined effects of the three EDCs were dose addition. Mixtures in LOAEL doses, NP and DES combined effects on rat uterine/body weight ratio indicates antagonistic based on the CA concept but additive based on the factorial analysis. Combined effects of other mixtures are all additive by using the two models. Our results showed that CA model provide more accurate results than the factorial analysis, the mode of combined effects of the three EDCs were dose addition, except mixtures in LOAEL doses, NP and DES combined effects indicates antagonistic effects based on the CA model but additive based on the factorial analysis. In particular, BPA and NP produced combination effects that are larger than the effect of each mixture component applied separately at BMDL doses, which show that additivity is important in the assessment of chemicals with estrogenic effects. The use of BMDL as point of departure in risk assessment may lead to underestimation of risk, and a more balanced approach should be considered in risk assessment.",PMC6515622

Their EC50 values for cytotoxicity and logPOW values are comparable. However, the estrogenic activities of these bisphenols are not comparable and among this group only BPC leads to a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP concentration in HepG2 cells. Conversely, the cell division rate was decreased by BPS, BPA, BPC and BPA/C at 10% toxicity (EC10). At lower concentrations, only BPC significantly affected proliferation. The pro-inflammatory cytokines TGFB1 and TNF were significantly upregulated by BPC only, while SPP1 was upregulated by BPA, BPA/C and BPS. BPC led to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, indicating that this compound is capable of inducing apoptosis.

Additionally, compared to their male counterparts, PCB-exposed females exhibited dysregulated hepatic gene expression favoring lipid accumulation rather than lipid breakdown; accompanied by dyslipidemia. Sex differences were also observed in the expression and activation of PCB targets such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while PCB-induced pancreatic toxicity was similar in both sexes. Importantly, PCB exposure appeared to cause pro-androgenic, anti-estrogenic along with sex-dependent thyroid hormone effects.

Importantly, increasing evidence indicates that the impacts of DEHP exposure on reproduction and social behavior persist across multiple generations. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that transgenerational DEHP exposure alters anxiety-like behavior and neural gene expression in both male and female mice.

Here we examined effects of BPA, BPS, and BPF in low concentrations on differentiation in murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We also fed adult male mice chow with one of three doses of BPF (0, 0.5, 5, 50 mg/kg chow, or approximately 0.044, 0.44 and 4.4 mg/kg body weight per day) for 12 weeks, collected body weights, food intake, and tested for glucose tolerance. The doses of BPF used produced mean concentrations of 0, 6.2, 43.6, and 561 ng/mL in plasma. In 3T3-L1 cells BPS had the greatest effects, along with BPA, both increased expression of several genes required for preadipocyte differentiation over 12 days in culture. In contrast, BPF decreased expression of several genes late in differentiation. This dichotomy was also reflected in lipid accumulation as BPA and BPS treated cells had elevated lipid concentrations compared to controls or cells treated with BPF. Male mice fed either the highest or lowest concentrations of BPF gained less weight than controls with no effects on glucose levels or glucose tolerance. Plasma levels of BPF reflected doses in food with no overlap between doses. In summary, our results suggest that BPS has a strong potential to be obesogenic while effects of BPF are subtler and potentially in the opposite direction.",PMC6574128

Exposure to DEHP has been shown to alter ovarian function in humans. Additionally, foods high in fat content, regularly found in the western diet, have been shown to be another potential disruptor of fetal ovarian function. Due to DEHP's lipophilicity, high-fat foods can be easily contaminated. Therefore, exposure to DEHP and a high-fat diet are both health concerns, especially in pregnant women, and the effects of these exposures on fetal oocyte quality and quantity should be elucidated. In this study, our goal was to determine if there are synergistic effects of DEHP exposure at an environmentally relevant level (20 μg/kg body weight/day) and high-fat diet on oogenesis and folliculogenesis. Dams were fed with a high-fat diet (45 kcal% fat) or a control diet (10 kcal% fat) 1 week before mating and during pregnancy and lactation. The pregnant mice were dosed with DEHP (20 μg/kg body weight/day) or vehicle control from E10.5 to litter birth. We found that treatment with an environmentally relevant dosage of DEHP and consumption of high-fat diet significantly increases synapsis defects in meiosis and affects folliculogenesis in the F1 generation.",PMC7302514

Perturbation of steroid hormone signaling within the uterine milieu could contribute to the development of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. It is well established that bisphenol-A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical with weak estrogenic effects, although little is known about how it affects steroid hormone signaling in the adult uterus. Because BPA acts as a weak E, we hypothesized that chronic exposure to BPA would create an imbalance between E and P signaling and cause changes in the uterus, such as aberrant epithelial proliferation. Indeed, exposure to an environmentally relevant dose of BPA had a uterotrophic affect. BPA-treated mice showed increased proliferation, notably in the glandular epithelium, which are sites of origin for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer. Increased proliferation appeared to be mediated through a similar mechanism as E-induced proliferation, via activation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor pathway and phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases in the epithelium. Interestingly, BPA reduced expression of heart and neural crest derivatives expressed 2 (HAND2), a known mediator of the antiproliferative effects of P. BPA also increased methylation of a CpG island in the Hand2 gene promoter, suggesting that BPA may promote epithelial proliferation through epigenetic silencing of antiproliferative factors like HAND2. Collectively, these findings establish that chronic exposure to BPA impairs steroid hormone signaling in the mouse uterus, and may contribute to the pathogenesis of uterine hyperplasia and cancer.",PMC6482033

Many of these compounds are endocrine disruptors (EDCs) that target estrogen signaling, with effects on reproductive and non-reproductive tissues. We recently reported that zebrafish larvae transiently exposed to the pharmaceutical EDC 4-OH-A display visual deficits as adults. Here, we examine whether these long-term effects are due to compound-induced morphological and/or cellular changes. Zebrafish aged 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, or 7 days post-fertilization (larvae) or 3-4mos (adults) were exposed to either 4-OH-A or PCB1254 for 24 h. After that time, notochord length, eye diameter, inter-eye distance, and heart rate were measured from larvae; and aromatase (estrogen synthase) activity was measured in homogenates of adult brain tissue. In general, indices of larval growth and development were not altered by 24 h exposure to either compound. 4-OH-A potently inhibited aromatase activity, while PCB1254 did not, with inhibition continuing even after removal from treatment. These results support differential function of EDCs and indicate that developmental exposure to 4-OH-A causes sustained inhibition of aromatase, which could be associated with altered adult behaviors.",PMC6516860
30869130,"Karen R Kilcoyne, Rod T Mitchell",Effect of environmental and pharmaceutical exposures on fetal testis development and function: a systematic review of human experimental data.,2019,"Overall, the incidence of male reproductive disorders has increased in recent decades. Testicular development during fetal life is crucial for subsequent male reproductive function. Non-genomic factors such as environmental chemicals, pharmaceuticals and lifestyle have been proposed to impact on human fetal testicular development resulting in subsequent effects on male reproductive health. Whilst experimental studies using animal models have provided support for this hypothesis, more recently a number of experimental studies using human tissues and cells have begun to translate these findings to determine direct human relevance. The objective of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive description of the evidence for effects of prenatal exposure(s) on human fetal testis development and function. We present the effects of environmental, pharmaceutical and lifestyle factors in experimental systems involving exposure of human fetal testis tissues and cells. Comparison is made with existing epidemiological data primarily derived from a recent meta-analysis. For identification of experimental studies, PubMed and EMBASE were searched for articles published in English between 01/01/1966 and 13/07/2018 using search terms including 'endocrine disruptor', 'human', 'fetal', 'testis', 'germ cells', 'testosterone' and related search terms. Abstracts were screened for selection of full-text articles for further interrogation. Epidemiological studies involving exposure to the same agents were extracted from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis. Additional studies were identified through screening of bibliographies of full-texts of articles identified through the initial searches. A total of 25 experimental studies and 44 epidemiological studies were included. Consistent effects of analgesic and phthalate exposure on human fetal germ cell development are demonstrated in experimental models, correlating with evidence from epidemiological studies and animal models. Furthermore, analgesic-induced reduction in fetal testosterone production, which predisposes to the development of male reproductive disorders, has been reported in studies involving human tissues, which also supports data from animal and epidemiological studies. However, whilst reduced testosterone production has been demonstrated in animal studies following exposure(s) to a variety of environmental chemicals including phthalates and bisphenol A, these effects are not reproduced in experimental approaches using human fetal testis tissues. Direct experimental evidence for effects of prenatal exposure(s) on human fetal testis development and function exists. However, for many exposures the data is limited. The increasing use of human-relevant models systems in which to determine the effects of environmental exposure(s) (including mixed exposures) on development and function of human tissues should form an important part of the process for assessment of such exposures by regulatory bodies to take account of animal-human differences in susceptibility.",PMC6601394

Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor (ED), can lead to aberrant immunity and gut microbiota. We determined whether BPA had age-dependent effects on T1D by modulating immune homeostasis following various windows of exposure in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Juvenile NOD females were orally exposed to 0 or 30 µg BPA/kg BW from postnatal day (PND) 28 to PND56. Adult NOD females were exposed to 0 or 300 µg BPA/kg BW. Female and male NOD offspring were exposed to 0 or 300 µg BPA/kg BW perinatally from gestation day 5 to PND28 by dosing the dams. It was found that BPA increased T1D risk in juvenile females with gut microbiota shifted towards pro-inflammation (e.g. increased Jeotgalicoccus). In agreement with our previous study, adult females had a trend of increased T1D and a general increase in immune responses. However, female offspring had a reduced T1D development. Consistently, female offspring had a shift towards anti-inflammation (e.g. decreased pro-inflammatory F4/80+Gr1+ cells). In contrast, BPA had minimal effects on immunity and T1D in male offspring. Thus, it was concluded that BPA had age- and sex-dependent effects on T1D with the alteration of gut microbiota and inflammation being the primary mechanisms for T1D exacerbation in juvenile exposure and decreases of inflammation being responsible for attenuated T1D in perinatally exposed females.",PMC6538306

Previously, we screened 293 ToxCast chemicals (ph1v2) using a HEK293T cell line expressing human NIS in parallel radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) and cell viability assays to identify potential environmental NIS inhibitors. Here, we expanded NIS inhibitor screening for a set of 768 ToxCast Phase II (ph2) chemicals, and applied a novel computational toxicology approach based on the ToxPrint chemotype to identify chemical substructures associated with NIS inhibition. Following single-concentration screening (at 1 × 10-4 M with a 20% inhibition cutoff), 235 samples (228 chemicals) were further tested in multiple-concentration (1 × 10-9 - 1 × 10-4 M) format in both RAIU and cell viability assays. The 167 chemicals that exhibited significant RAIU inhibition were then prioritized using combined RAIU and cell viability responses that were normalized relative to the known NIS inhibitor sodium perchlorate. Some of the highest ranked chemicals, such as PFOS, tributyltin chloride, and triclocarban, have been previously reported to be thyroid disruptors. In addition, several novel chemicals were identified as potent NIS inhibitors. The present results were combined with the previous ph1v2 screening results to produce two sets of binary hit-calls for 1028 unique chemicals, consisting of 273 positives exhibiting significant RAIU inhibition, and 63 positives following application of a cell viability filter. A ToxPrint chemotype-enrichment analysis identified >20 distinct chemical substructural features, represented in >60% of the active chemicals, as significantly enriched in each NIS inhibition hit-call space.

To investigate whether urinary concentrations of BPA, parabens, and phthalate metabolite mixtures are associated with reproductive outcomes among women undergoing IVF. This prospective cohort study included 420 women contributing 648 IVF cycles who provided up to two urine samples per cycle prior to oocyte retrieval (N = 1145) between 2006 and 2017 at the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center, and had available urine biomarker data. Urinary concentrations of BPA, parabens, and phthalate metabolites were quantified using isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. Intermediate and clinical end-points of IVF treatments were abstracted from electronic medical records. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) were used to identify main patterns of BPA, parabens, and phthalate metabolites concentrations. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the association between PCA-derived factor scores, in quartiles, and IVF outcomes, using random intercepts to account for multiple IVF cycles and adjusting for known confounders. Because of temporal trends in exposure, we conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted to women who underwent IVF cycles in the earlier years of study (2006-2012). Urinary concentrations of BPA, parabens, and most phthalate metabolites were significantly lower during the second half of the study period (2013-2017) than during the first half (2006-2012). None of the three factors derived from the PCA [di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), non-DEHP, and paraben] was associated with IVF outcomes in the main analyses. Similarly, BKRM analyses did not identify any associations of individual urinary concentrations of BPA, paraben and phthalate metabolites with IVF outcomes while accounting for correlation between exposures. However, in sensitivity analyses restricted to women who underwent IVF cycles from 2006 to 2012, where concentrations of most phthalates and phenols were higher, there were decreases in implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth across quartiles of the DEHP factor. Specifically, women in the highest quartile of the DEHP factor had, on average, lower probabilities of implantation (-22% p, trend = 0.08), clinical pregnancy (-24% p, trend = 0.14), and live birth (-38% p, trend = 0.06) compared to women in the lowest quartile. Among this group of women, BKMR results did not identify any single contributor driving the decreased probabilities of live birth within the DEHP factor.

Redox signaling underlies several aspects of WAT physiology; however, the thiol redox environment of WAT has not yet been fully characterized. Dietary and endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposures during development can transiently impact the cellular redox environment, but it is unknown whether these exposures can reprogram the WAT thiol redox environment. To characterize the WAT thiol redox environment, we took a descriptive approach and measured thiol redox parameters using high-performance liquid chromatography in mouse mesenteric (mWAT), gonadal (gWAT) and subinguinal (sWAT) depots. Cysteine (CYSS:CYS) and glutathione (GSSG:GSH) redox potentials (Eh) were more oxidizing in gWAT and sWAT than mWAT. Increased body weight, relative WAT weight and age were associated with oxidizing GSSG:GSH Eh in mWAT in a sex-specific manner. Body weight and relative WAT weight were also positively associated with GSSG:GSH Eh in sWAT. We carried out a second mouse study with perinatal exposures to bisphenol A (BPA) and Mediterranean and Western high-fat diets (HFDs) to determine whether early-life chemical and dietary factors have long-lasting impacts on mWAT redox parameters. Mice exposed to Mediterranean HFD or BPA had more oxidizing GSSG:GSH mWAT Eh than controls, with more pronounced differences in females. These findings suggest an important role for the thiol redox environment in WAT physiology. Observed sex-specific and depot-specific differences in thiol redox parameters are consistent with known WAT physiology.

In the present study the impacts of perinatal BPA exposure (0.1 mg/L in drinking water) spanning gestation and lactation on TH homeostasis in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus were assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day 21 (PND21) and PND90. As TH regulates brain glucose metabolism at multiple levels，the effects of BPA treatment on glucose metabolism in the brain tissues were also assessed in adult rats. The results showed heterogeneous changes in TH concentration induced by BPA between serum and brain tissues, additionally, in the BPA-treated pups, up-regulated expression of the TH transporter monocarboxylate 8 mRNA at PND21 and increased type 3 iodothyronine deiodinase mRNA expressions at PND21 and PND90 were observed. Meanwhile, decreased glucose metabolism was seen in the PFC and hippocampus, while deficits in locomotor activity, spatial memory and social behaviors occurred in BPA-treated groups. These data support the concept that the developing brain possesses potent mechanisms to compensate for a small reduction in serum TH, such as serum hypothyrodism induced by BPA exposure, however, the long-term negative effect of BPA treatment on TH homeostasis and glucose metabolism may be attributable to neuropsychiatric deficits after mature.",PMC6422808

In this study, we exposed primary granulosa cells to different concentrations of BPA (0, 20, 200, 2000, and 20 000 ng/ml) and used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression levels of miRNAs enriched in extracellular vesicles (EV-enriched miRNAs), and cellular levels of selected target genes of differentially expressed EV-enriched miRNAs. We found that exposure to 20 000 ng/ml BPA was associated with decreased levels of EV-miR-27b-3p (FC = 0.58, p = .04) and increased levels of its biologically relevant target genes FADD (FC = 1.22, p = .01), IGF1 (FC = 1.59, p = .06), and PPARG (FC = 1.73, p = .001) as compared with the control. In addition, we observed that under the same exposure conditions, the expression levels of miR-27b-3p in granulosa cells were also downregulated (FC = 0.65, p = .03) as compared with the control.

We hypothesize that mixtures of PFAAs may affect human fetal growth by disrupting the ER. We aimed to study the associations between the combined xenoestrogenic activity of PFAAs in pregnant women's serum and offspring BW, length, and head circumference. We extracted the actual mixture of PFAAs from the serum of 702 Danish pregnant women (gestational wk 11–13) enrolled in the Aarhus Birth Cohort (ABC) using solid phase extraction, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and weak anion exchange. PFAA-induced xenoestrogenic receptor transactivation (XER) was determined using the stable transfected MVLN cell line. Associations between XER and measures of fetal growth were estimated using multivariable linear regression with primary adjustment for maternal age, body mass index (BMI), educational level, smoking, and alcohol intake, and sensitivity analyses with additional adjustment for gestational age (GA) (linear and quadratic). On average, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in XER was associated with a [Formula: see text] [95% confidence interval (CI): [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text]] decrease in BW and a [Formula: see text] (95% CI: 0.1, 0.5) decrease in birth length.

Endometriosis incidence has risen; however, whether this rise is due to disease awareness or environmental contamination is not known. The objective of this study was to determine if bisphenol A (BPA) or bisphenol AF (BPAF) potentiate the development of endometriosis and if hormonal status alters how toxicant exposure affects disease. A mouse model of endometriosis, where minced uterine tissue is injected into the peritoneal cavity of a host mouse, was used to examine the effects of BPA and BPAF on endometriosis lesion development in ovariectomized and hormonally intact mice. BPA and BPAF were delivered through diet to include no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) and the low-observed-adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) exposure levels. After six weeks (at necropsy), lesions, ovaries, and blood were collected to examine characteristics, gene expression, and hormonal regulation. BPA and BPAF treatments affected endometriosis in a manner specific to dose and hormonal status of the host mouse. Estrogen and endometriosis-mediated differences in lesion target gene expression also depended on hormonal status. In intact mice, ovarian steroidogenic pathways were disrupted, progesterone levels were lowered, and atretic oocyte numbers were higher with toxicant exposure. BPAF, more so than BPA, resulted in more endometriosis lesion growth, but both toxicants disrupted normal ovarian signaling. These findings further our understanding of the effects and hormonal impacts of BPA and BPAF on endometriosis perturbation in ovariectomized and hormonally intact mice. BPAF appeared to be similar if not more estrogenic than BPA and may be affecting an environmental contribution of the increased incidence of endometriosis. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3802.",PMC6371646

This is concerning because DEHP is an endocrine disruptor and ovarian toxicant. Diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) is a DEHP replacement that is a rising human toxicant due to its increased use as a DEHP substitute. However, little is known about the effects of DEHP or DiNP exposure during adulthood on female reproduction. Thus, this study tested the hypothesis that DEHP or DiNP exposure during adulthood has long-term consequences for female reproduction in mice. Adult female CD-1 mice (39-40 days) were orally dosed with vehicle control (corn oil), DEHP (20 µg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day), or DiNP (20 µg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day) for 10 days. Females were paired with untreated male mice for breeding trials immediately post-dosing and again at 3 and 9 months post-dosing. Immediately post-dosing, DEHP and DiNP did not affect fertility. At 3 months post-dosing, DiNP (20 and 100 µg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day) significantly disrupted estrous cyclicity, and DiNP and DEHP (20 µg/kg/day) significantly reduced the ability of females to get pregnant. At 9 months post-dosing, DiNP significantly disrupted estrous cyclicity (100 µg/kg/day), reduced time to mating (100 µg/kg/day-200 mg/kg/day), and borderline reduced percent of females who produced offspring (20 mg/kg/day). At 9 months post-dosing, DEHP (200 µg/kg/day and 200 mg/kg/day) and DiNP (100 µg/kg/day and 20 and 200 mg/kg/day) increased numbers of male-biased litters.

Unlike alternative luminescent reporters, this bioreporter generates bioluminescence autonomously without requiring an external light-activating chemical substrate or cellular destruction. The bioreporter's performance was validated against a library of 76 agonistic and antagonistic estrogenic endocrine disruptor chemicals and demonstrated reproducible half maximal effective concentration (EC50) values meeting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for Tier 1 endocrine disrupting chemical screening assays. For model compounds, such as the estrogen receptor (ER) agonist 17β-estradiol, HEK293ERE/Gal4-Lux demonstrated an EC50 value (7.9 × 10-12 M) comparable to that of the current EPA-approved HeLa-9903 firefly luciferase-based estrogen receptor transcription assay (4.6 × 10-12 M). Screening against an expanded array of common ER agonists likewise produced similar relative effect potencies as compared with existing assays. The self-initiated autobioluminescent signal of the bioreporter permitted facile monitoring of the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals, which decreased the cost and hands-on time required to perform these assays.

We evaluated the association between 11 urinary phthalate metabolites and GDM, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and continuous blood glucose concentration during pregnancy in The Infant Development and Environment Study (TIDES). Based on prior study results, our primary analyses focused on monoethyl phthalate (MEP) in relation to our outcomes of interest. We used multi-variable logistic regression to examine the odds of GDM and IGT in relation to an interquartile-range (IQR) increase in natural log (ln)-transformed, specific gravity (SG)-adjusted first trimester (T1) and average of T1 and third trimester (T3) (""T1T3avg"") phthalate metabolite concentrations. We fit linear regression models to examine the percent change in blood glucose per IQR increase in ln-transformed, SG-adjusted T1 and T1T3avg phthalates. In sensitivity analyses, we examined interactions between exposure and race. We adjusted for maternal age, maternal body mass index, study center, race/ethnicity, parity, and gestational age at glucose testing. In our sample of 705 pregnant women, we observed 60 cases of GDM, 90 cases of IGT, and an average GLT blood glucose of 113.6 ± 27.7 mg/dL.

The endocrine disrupting chemical bisphenol A (BPA) has widespread human exposure and can modulate immune function and the gut microbiome (GMB), which may contribute to the increasing T1D incidence worldwide. It was hypothesized that BPA had sex-dependent effects on T1D by modulating immune homeostasis and GMB. Adult female and male non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice were orally administered BPA at environmentally relevant doses (30 or 300 µg/kg). Antibiotic-treated adult NOD females were exposed to 0 or 30 µg/kg BPA. BPA accelerated T1D development in females, but delayed males from T1D. Consistently, females had a shift towards pro-inflammation (e.g., increased macrophages and Bacteroidetes), while males had increases in anti-inflammatory immune factors and a decrease in both anti- and pro-inflammatory GMB. Although bacteria altered during sub-acute BPA exposure differed from bacteria altered from chronic BPA exposure in both sexes, the GMB profile was consistently pro-inflammatory in females, while males had a general decrease of both anti- and pro-inflammatory gut microbes. However, treatment of females with the antibiotic vancomycin failed to prevent BPA-induced glucose intolerance, suggesting changes in Gram-positive bacteria were not a primary mechanism.

Pregnant rats were exposed to EDCs with different modes of action: the weakly estrogenic polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Aroclor 1221, the anti-androgenic fungicide vinclozolin (VIN), or the vehicle (6% dimethylsulfoxide in sesame oil; VEH) during embryonic development. The F1 male and female offspring were bred through the paternal- or maternal-lineage with untreated partners to generate F2 offspring. This process was repeated through both maternal and paternal lineages to create the F3 generation. Maternal care of F2 dams towards their F3 offspring was altered in a lineage-dependent manner, particularly in PCB paternal-lineage animals. When F3 pups were recorded for ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) following separation from the mother, the rate of neonatal USVs in F3 offspring were decreased in PCB paternal-lineage pups. In adulthood, anxiety-like behaviors of the F3 rats were tested, with only small effects of EDCs detected.

The range of soil properties has an important influence on the expression of PAE toxicity, and the mechanisms by which soil physical and chemical properties affect the expression of toxicity of target PAEs to plants and microorganisms requires further investigation. Important soil factors affecting the eco-toxicological effects of two typical PAEs, di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), on lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in a spiked soil were investigated in the present study. Soil at various pH values was spiked with three PAE concentrations (1, 5 and 20 mg DnBP or DEHP kg-1 soil), organic matter contents and water holding contents to simulate the greenhouse soil environment for 30 days. Their influence on the biomass, photosynthetic pigment contents, various physiological changes and soil microbial communities was determined as endpoints. The toxicity to lettuce of DnBP was higher than that of DEHP in the soil and soil pH was the most important factor affecting their single toxicity, followed by soil organic matter content and soil moisture content in agreement with the Biolog test results. Under different soil conditions total protein, total soluble sugar and free amino acid contents were positively correlated with concentrations of the target PAEs, but leaf area, biomass, •O2- activity, vitamin C content and soil microbial diversity indices showed the opposite trend. Chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents were more inhibited by DnBP together with impacts on indices of soil microbial diversity.

In this study, we investigate and explore big data technologies and machine learning approaches to do an efficient chemical data mining for endocrine receptor disruption prediction and virtual compound screening. The power of artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting chemicals' activity toward androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) and thereby classifying into human endocrine disruptor or nondisruptor is investigated. Molecules are collected along with their Inhibitory Concentration (IC 50) values toward AR and ER. Training and test datasets are created with active and inactive classes of molecules. Molecular fingerprints of Electro Topological State (E-State) are generated for describing every compound. ANN machine learning model is created using Apache Spark and implemented in Hadoop big data environment. Test chemical's structural similarity toward active class of training compounds is estimated and combined with ANN model for improving prediction accuracy. AR and ER predictive models applied on corresponding test datasets gave 86.31% and 89.57% accuracies, respectively, in correctly classifying molecules as disruptor or nondisruptor. Molecular fragments and functional groups are ranked based on their importance in forming ANN model and influence toward the AR and ER disruption behavior. Training molecules that are specific to the test molecules' endocrine disruption prediction are retrieved based on the structural similarity values. The current study demonstrates a new approach of chemical endocrine receptor disruption prediction combining ANN machine learning method and molecular similarity in a big data environment.

Pubertal timing was assessed among 179 girls and 159 boys every 9 months between ages 9 and 13 using clinical Tanner staging. Accelerated failure time models were used to obtain mean shifts of pubertal timing associated with concentrations of prenatal and peripubertal biomarkers. In girls, we observed earlier onset of pubic hair development with prenatal urinary MEP concentrations and earlier menarche with prenatal triclosan and 2,4-dichlorophenol concentrations. Regarding peripubertal biomarkers, we observed: earlier breast development, pubic hair development and menarche with methyl paraben; earlier menarche with propyl paraben; and later pubic hair development with 2,5-dichlorophenol. In boys, we observed no associations with prenatal urinary biomarker concentrations and only one association with peripubertal concentrations: earlier genital development with propyl paraben. These chemicals are quickly metabolized and one to two urinary measurements per developmental point may not accurately reflect usual exposure.

Because disruption of the circadian clock is tightly associated with metabolic consequences, we explored how BPA affects the components of the molecular circadian clock in the feeding-related neurons of the hypothalamus. In immortalized POMC and NPY/AgRP-expressing hypothalamic cell lines and primary culture, we describe how BPA significantly alters mRNA expression of circadian clock genes Bmal1,Per2, and Rev-Erbα. Furthermore, we use newly generated Bmal1-knockout (KO) hypothalamic cell lines to link the BPA-induced neuropeptide dysregulation to the molecular clock. Specifically, BPA increased Npy, Agrp, and Pomc mRNA expression in wild type hypothalamic cells, whereas the increase in Npy, but not Agrp or Pomc, was abolished in cell lines lacking BMAL1. In line with this increase, BPA led to increased BMAL1 binding to the Npy promotor, potentially increasing Npy transcription. In conclusion, we show that BPA-mediated dysregulation of the circadian molecular clock is linked to the deleterious effects of BPA on neuropeptide expression. Furthermore, we describe hypothalamic Bmal1-KO cell lines to study the role of BMAL1 in hypothalamic responses to metabolic, hormonal, and environmental factors.",PMC6307099

These EDCs dysregulate a number of biomolecules and pathways, including microRNAs. MicroRNAs can be carried in transport systems called extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are present in most biofluids. EVs in the follicular fluid, which fills the ovarian follicle and influences oocyte developmental competency, carry microRNAs (EV-miRNAs) that have been associated with In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) outcomes. However, it remains unclear whether EDCs affect EV-miRNAs in follicular fluid. This study sought to determine whether urinary concentrations of phenols and phthalates biomarkers are associated with EV-miRNAs expression in follicular fluid collected from women undergoing IVF treatment. This cross-sectional study included 130 women recruited between January 2014 and August 2016 in a tertiary university-affiliated hospital. Participants provided urine samples during ovarian stimulation and on the day of oocyte retrieval. We assessed urinary concentrations of five phenols, eight phthalate metabolites, and one phthalate alternative metabolite. EV-miRNAs were isolated from follicular fluid and their expression profiles were measured using the TaqMan Open Array® Human microRNA panel. We fitted multivariable linear regression models and principal component analysis to examine associations between individual and molar sums of exposure biomarkers and EV-miRNAs. Of 754 miRNAs tested, we detected 133 EV-miRNAs in the microRNA array which expressed in at least 50% of the follicular fluid samples. After adjusting for multiple testing, we identified eight EV-miRNAs associated with individual phenols and phthalate metabolites, as well as molar ΣDEHP that met a q < 0.10 false-discovery rate (FDR) threshold. Hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-106b, hsa-miR-374a, and hsa-miR15b was associated with mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate concentrations, hsa-let-7c with concentrations mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (MEOHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), and the sum of metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, hsa-miR-24 with mono-n-butyl phthalate concentrations, hsa-miR-19a with cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid monohydroxy isononyl ester (MHiNCH), and hsa-miR-375 with ethyl paraben concentrations. Using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, gene targets and pathways of these EV-miRNAs were predicted in silico and 17 KEGG FDR-significant pathways related to follicular development and oocyte competence were identified. Our results show that urinary concentrations of select phenol and phthalate metabolites are correlated with altered EV-miRNAs expression in follicular fluid. These findings may provide insight regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying adverse effects of phenol and phthalate exposure on female fertility.",PMC6343661

Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used for targeted analysis of selected EDCs as well as to identify and quantify a few metabolites using post-acquisition data mining. Solid-phase extraction (SPE) was applied to liquid matrices in order to reduce matrix effects and provide required sample concentration and ultimately, high sensitivity and selectivity of measurements. SPE recoveries in liquid samples ranged from 49 to 140% with method quantification limits not exceeding 1 ng L-1 for the majority of EDCs. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was applied to solid samples and when followed by SPE, it permitted the analysis of EDCs in digested sludge. MAE/SPE recoveries varied from 11 to 186% and MQLs between 0.03 and 8.1 ng g-1 with the majority of compounds showing MQLs below 2 ng g-1. Mass error for quantifier and qualifier ions was below 5 ppm when analysing river water and effluent wastewater and below 10 ppm when analysing influent wastewater and solid samples. The method was successfully applied to environmental samples, with 33 EDCs identified and quantified in wastewater and receiving waters. In addition, several EDCs were found in digested sludge, which confirms that for a more comprehensive understanding of exposure patterns and environmental impact, analysis of solids cannot be neglected. Finally, post-acquisition data mining permitted the identification and quantification of a metabolite of BPA and the identification of a metabolite of 4-Cl-3-methylphenol.

These and modern endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as the fungicide vinclozolin (VIN) perturb hormone signaling and lead to dysfunctions following prenatal exposures. Beyond direct exposures, transgenerational disease phenotypes can persist for multiple generations without subsequent exposure. The mechanisms of action of these EDCs differ: VIN is anti-androgenic while the PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221) is weakly estrogenic. Based on limited evidence for the inheritance of epimutations in germline, we measured DNA methylation in brain and sperm of rats. Pregnant dams were exposed from day 8-18 of gestation to low dosages of VIN, A1221, or the vehicle. To produce paternal lineages, exposed F1 males were bred with untreated females, creating the F2 and subsequently F3 generations. In adult F1 and F3 males, mature sperm was collected, and brain nuclei involved in anxiety and social behaviors (CA3 of the hippocampus; central amygdala) were selected for assays of epimutations in CpG islands using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In F1 sperm, VIN and PCBs induced differential methylation in 215 and 284 CpG islands, respectively, compared to vehicle. The majority of effects were associated with hypermethylation. Fewer epimutations were detected in the brain. A subset of differentially methylated regions were retained from the F1 to the F3 generation, suggesting a common mechanism of EDC and germline epigenome interaction. Thus, EDCs can cause heritable epimutations in the sperm that may embody the future phenotype of brain-behavior disorders caused by direct or transgenerational exposures.",PMC6342067

The aim of this study was to determine the excretion of urinary metabolites in 16 individuals after inhalation and/or dermal exposure to 100⁻300 µg/m³ of deuterium-labelled diethyl phthalate (D₄-DEP) and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (D₄-DEHP). Dermal exposure in this study represents a case with clean clothing acting as a barrier. After inhalation, D₄-DEP and D₄-DEHP metabolites were excreted rapidly, though inter-individual variation was high. D₄-DEP excretion peaked 3.3 h (T½ of 2.1 h) after combined inhalation and dermal exposure, with total excreted metabolite levels ranging from 0.055 to 2.351 nmol/nmol/m³ (nmol of urinary metabolites per phthalates air concentration in (nmol/m³)). After dermal exposure to D₄-DEP, metabolite excretion peaked 4.6 h (T½ of 2.7 h) after exposure, with excreted metabolite levels in between 0.017 and 0.223 nmol/nmol/m³. After combined inhalation and dermal exposure to D₄-DEHP, the excretion of all five analysed metabolites peaked after 4.7 h on average (T½ of 4.8 h), and metabolite levels ranged from 0.072 to 1.105 nmol/nmol/m³ between participants. No dermal uptake of particle phase D₄-DEHP was observed. In conclusion, the average excreted levels of metabolites after combined inhalation and dermal exposure to D₄-DEP was three times higher than after combined exposure to D₄-DEHP; and nine times higher than after dermal exposure of D₄-DEP. This study was made possible due to the use of novel approaches, i.e., the use of labelled phthalate esters to avoid the background concentration, and innovative technique of phthalate generation, both in the particle and the gas phase.",PMC6266104

Pregnant women are especially vulnerable to phthalate exposure due to physiological and metabolic changes during pregnancy, including those related to the metabolism of xenobiotics. Phthalate exposure during pregnancy has been associated with early gestational weight gain, however, its effect on long-term weight gain remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between phthalate exposure during pregnancy and long-term changes in weight among women. Urinary phthalate concentrations, socioeconomic, anthropometry and information on diet and socioeconomic status were collected during pregnancy from 178 women from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohort. Maternal body weight and diet information was also collected up to 5 times in the first year postpartum and twice during follow-up visits 5.2-10.7 years later. A path analysis was performed to assess associations between urinary phthalate metabolite levels during pregnancy and change in weight (kg) per year after delivery, including age, education, living with/without partner, parity, daily energy intake and breastfeeding duration. The mean age at pregnancy was 27.3 ± 5.9 years and mean body mass index during the first postpartum year was 27.07 ± 4.22 kg/m2. On average, women gained 3.48 kg (0.52 ± 0.84 kg/year). A unit increase in log-transformed mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) was associated with 0.33 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 0.56) higher weight gain per year, and mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) with 0.21 kg (95% CI: -0.38, -0.03) lower weight gain per year.

Limited data are available on the relationship between exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals and the human metabolome. We examined the relationship of metabolomic profiles in plasma and urine of 115 pregnant women with eleven urine phthalate metabolites measured at 26 weeks of gestation to identify potential biomarkers and relevant pathways. Targeted metabolomics was performed by selected reaction monitoring liquid chromatography and triple quadrupole mass spectrometry to measure 415 metabolites in plasma and 151 metabolites in urine samples. We have chosen metabolites with the best defined peaks for more detailed analysis (138 in plasma and 40 in urine). Relationship between urine phthalate metabolites and concurrent metabolomic markers in plasma and urine suggested potential involvement of diverse pathways including lipid, steroid, and nucleic acid metabolism and enhanced inflammatory response. Most of the correlations were positive for both urine and plasma, and further confirmed by regression and PCA analysis. However, after the FDR adjustment for multiple comparisons, only 9 urine associations remained statistically significant (q-values 0.0001-0.0451), including Nicotinamide mononucleotide, Cysteine T2, Cystine, and L-Aspartic acid. Additionally, we found negative associations of maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) with more than 20 metabolomic markers related to lipid and amino-acid metabolism and inflammation pathways in plasma (p = 0.01-0.0004), while Mevalonic acid was positively associated (p = 0.009). Nicotinic acid, the only significant metabolite in urine, had a positive association with maternal BMI (p = 0.002). In summary, when evaluated in the context of metabolic pathways, the findings suggest enhanced lipid biogenesis, inflammation and altered nucleic acid metabolism in association with higher phthalate levels. These results provide new insights into the relationship between phthalates, common in most human populations, and metabolomics, a novel approach to exposure and health biomonitoring.",PMC6204535

Adsorption kinetics of BPA was found to fit well a pseudo-second order reaction. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted by Langmuir and Freundlich models. A very fast and simple regeneration method was developed and it was observed that adsorption capacity of the fibers was kept almost unchanged after 3 consecutive uses. Bottled water and synthetic wastewater were also tested to assess the efficiency of the process under more realistic water and wastewater treatment conditions. It was found that BPA removal was slightly decreased from 77% in ultrapure water to 64% in synthetic wastewater matrix, indicating that FF has a high selectivity toward BPA, even in the presence of other organic compounds.

In this study, we determined the transgenerational effects (F3) of BPA on metabolic health and pancreatic islets in our model. Adult F3 LowerB and UpperB male offspring had increased body weight relative to Controls, however glucose tolerance was similar in the three groups. F3 LowerB, but not UpperB, males had reduced β-cell mass and smaller islets which was associated with increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Similar to F1 and F2 BPA male offspring, staining for markers of T-cells and macrophages (CD3 and F4/80) was increased in pancreas of F3 LowerB and UpperB male offspring, which was associated with changes in cytokine levels. In contrast to F3 BPA males, LowerB and UpperB female offspring had comparable body weight, glucose tolerance and insulin secretion as Controls.

To assess the association between phthalate metabolites and BPA with early pregnancy endpoints in a cohort of women followed from before conception. We quantified 11 phthalate metabolites and BPA in 137 conception cycles from naturally conceived clinical pregnancies. Phthalate metabolites and BPA concentrations were measured in a pooled sample of three daily morning urine specimens. Daily urinary hormone measurements had previously been used to define ovulation, implantation, and corpus luteum rescue. We assessed associations between conception cycle exposures (phthalate biomarkers and BPA) and 1) time from ovulation to implantation; 2) type of corpus luteum rescue (timing and pattern of rise in progesterone: early, late, or no rise); and 3) rate of initial rise in hCG. Mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP) and mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) were associated with earlier implantation (6-8 days vs. 9 days (the most commonly observed); per natural log-unit, OR (95% CI) = 2.8 (1.2, 6.7) and OR (CI) = 2.1 (1.2, 3.7), respectively). Monoethyl phthalate (MEP) was associated with later implantation (10-12 days vs. 9 days); OR (CI) = 1.5 (1.0, 2.1).

Besides its well documented adverse effects on reproduction and development observed in rodents, latest studies strongly suggest that BPA disrupts several endogenous metabolic pathways, with suspected steatogenic and obesogenic effects. BPA's adverse effects on reproduction are attributed to its ability to activate estrogen receptors (ERs), but its effects on metabolism and its mechanism(s) of action at low doses are so far only marginally understood. Metabolomics based approaches are increasingly used in toxicology to investigate the biological changes induced by model toxicants and chemical mixtures, to identify markers of toxicity and biological effects. In this study, we used proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) based untargeted metabolite profiling, followed by multivariate statistics and computational analysis of metabolic networks to examine the metabolic modulation induced in human hepatic cells (HepG2) by an exposure to low and very low doses of BPA (10-6M, 10-9M, and 10-12M), vs. the female reference hormone 17β-estradiol (E2, 10-9M, 10-12M, and 10-15M). Metabolomic analysis combined to metabolic network reconstruction highlighted different mechanisms at lower doses of exposure.

This is particularly important in areas such as Puerto Rico, where residents have higher exposures to numerous chemicals, as well as higher rates of many adverse health outcomes, compared to the mainland US. The aim of this study was to assess distributions, time trends, and predictors of urinary triclocarban, phenol, and paraben biomarkers measured at multiple times during pregnancy among women living in Northern Puerto Rico. We recruited 1003 pregnant women between years 2010 and 2016 from prenatal clinics and collected urine samples and questionnaire data on personal care product use at up to three separate visits, between 16 and 28 weeks gestation.

Detectable triclocarban, phenol and paraben concentrations among pregnant women were prevalent and tended to be higher than levels measured in women of reproductive age from the general US population, especially triclocarban, which had a median concentration 37 times higher in Puerto Rico participants (2.6 vs 0.07 ng/mL). A decreasing temporal trend was statistically significant for urine concentrations of BPA during the study period, while the BPA substitute BPS showed an increasing temporal trend. Significant and positive associations were found between biomarker concentrations with the products use in the past 48-h (soap, sunscreen, lotion, cosmetics). There was an increasing trend of triclocarban/triclosan urinary concentrations with increased concentrations of triclocarban/triclosan listed as the active ingredient in the bar soap/liquid soap products reported being used.

Therefore, male C57BL/6 J mice fed a control synthetic diet were treated with either a NDL PCB mixture, Aroclor 1260 (20 mg/kg); a single DL PCB congener, PCB 126 (20 μg/kg); a NDL/DL mixture, Aroclor 1260 plus PCB 126; or vehicle control for 2 weeks. PCB126 had the greatest impact on hepatic lipid metabolism. It caused steatosis due to increased hepatic lipid import with associated hypolipidemia. However, all PCB exposures impacted expression of hepatic lipid metabolism genes in different manners. The 'NASH gene', Pnpla3, was elevated by Aroclor 1260, but decreased by all other exposures. The expression of hepatokines implicated in metabolic syndrome (Fgf21, Igf1, and betatrophin) were differentially regulated. The NDL/DL PCB mixture had the greatest effects on pancreatic histology, including acinar cell atrophy, mild steatosis, and fibrosis without ductal changes or immune cell infiltration. It decreased expression of insulin and altered the expression of genes regulating islet identity. None of these exposures was associated with altered HOMA-IR or HOMA-B. In summary, PCB exposures differentially regulated liver and pancreas structure and function.

We included human retrospective and prospective cohort, cross-sectional and case-control studies that examined phthalates, bisphenol A, triclosan, triclocarban, benzophenones, parabens and glycol ethers in consumer products, and considered TTP or fecundability as an outcome among women, men and couples conceiving without medical assistance. We excluded editorials, opinion pieces, introductions to special sections, articles that described only lifestyle (e.g. caffeine, stress) or clinical factors (e.g. semen parameters, IVF success). Standardized forms for screening, data extraction and study quality were developed using DistillerSR software and completed in duplicate. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess risk of bias and devised additional quality metrics based on specific methodological features of fecundability studies. The search returned 3456 articles. There were 15 papers from 12 studies which met inclusion criteria, of which eight included biomarkers of chemical exposure. Studies varied widely in terms of exposure characterization, precluding a meta-analytic approach. Among the studies that measured exposure using biospecimens, results were equivocal for associations between either male or female phthalate exposure and TTP. There was preliminary support for associations of female exposure to some parabens and glycol ethers and of male exposure to benzophenone with longer TTP, but further research and replication of these results are needed. The results provided little to no indication that bisphenol A, triclocarban or triclosan exposure was associated with TTP. Despite a growing literature on couple exposure to non-persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals and fecundability, evidence for associations between biologically measured exposures and TTP is limited. Equivocal results with different non-persistent chemical compounds and metabolites complicate the interpretation of our findings with respect to TTP, but do not preclude action, given the documented endocrine disrupting effects on other reproductive outcomes as well as fetal development.

Yet, epidemiological evidence is inconclusive. In a birth cohort (2008-2010, upstate New York), we quantified concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and bisphenol A (BPA) in stored newborn dried blood spots using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Mothers reported on children's behavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at age 7 (650 singletons and 138 twins). Difficulties in total behavior (i.e., emotional, conduct, hyperactivity, and peer problems) and prosocial behavior were classified using validated cut-offs. We used logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to estimate the odds of having difficulties per exposure category. In total, 111 children (12.1%) had total behavioral difficulties and 60 (6.5%) had difficulties in prosocial behavior. The median (interquartile range) of PFOS, PFOA, and BPA were 1.74 ng/ml (1.33), 1.12 ng/ml (0.96), and 7.93 ng/ml (10.79), respectively. Higher PFOS levels were associated with increased odds of having behavioral difficulties (OR per SD of log PFOS = 1.30, 95%CI: 1.03-1.65). We observed associations between PFOS in the highest relative to the lowest quartile and behavioral difficulties (OR for PFOS1.14-1.74 = 1.65, 95%CI: 0.84-3.34; PFOS1.75-2.47 = 1.73, 95%CI: 0.87-3.43; and PFOS>2.47 = 2.47, 95%CI: 1.29-4.72 compared to PFOS<1.41). The associations between higher concentrations of PFOS and behavioral difficulties at age 7 years were driven by problems in conduct and emotional symptoms. Higher PFOA levels were associated with difficulties in prosocial behavior (OR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.03-1.75). There was an inverse association between BPA concentrations and difficulties in prosocial behavior but only in the 2nd and 4th quartiles. We found no interactions between sex and chemical concentrations. Increasing prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA, as reflected in neonatal concentrations, may pose risk for child behavioral difficulties.",PMC6221990

Although it has been reported to affect the development of a variety of fetal reproductive tissues, data on the effect of fetal BPA exposure on oviducts were extremely limited and were only available in mice. To determine if there are adverse effects of gestational BPA exposure on fetal oviduct, we exposed pregnant rhesus macaques with female fetuses to oral or nonoral BPA during the last trimester of gestation (day 100 to term). After the treatment, fetal oviducts were collected for morphology evaluation. BPA exposure altered the percentages of different cell types (ciliated, nonciliated, and secretory) in the fetal oviduct and resulted in a significant high ciliated cell population in the BPA-exposed fetal oviduct. The distribution of ciliated cells on the epithelium in the BPA-exposed fetal oviduct was also altered. Gestational BPA exposure reduced the expression of mucosubstance and uteroglobin in secretory cells in the fetal oviduct. A comparison of the outcome of the fetal oviduct studies with similar outcomes previously reported in the lung from the same fetuses demonstrates that BPA exhibits opposite effects in these two organs. In conclusion, the BPA-associated alterations in the fetal oviduct could potentially affect the oviduct morphology and function later in life with a negative impact on fertility. The mechanisms of action of the differential response in the oviduct and the lung to BPA exposure require further investigation.",PMC6358242

We examined whether prenatal exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a family of ubiquitous industrial contaminants detectable in virtually all humans and wildlife, caused changes in sexually-dimorphic social interactions and communications, and profiled the underlying neuromolecular phenotype. Rats were treated with a PCB commercial mixture, Aroclor 1221 (A1221), estradiol benzoate (EB) as a positive control for estrogenic effects of A1221, or the vehicle (4% DMSO), on embryonic day (E) 16 and 18. In adult F1 offspring, we first conducted tests of ultrasonic vocalization (USV) calls in a sociosexual context as a measure of motivated communications. Numbers of certain USV call types were significantly increased by prenatal treatment with A1221 in males, and decreased by EB in females. In a test of sociosexual preference for a hormone-vs. a non-hormone-primed opposite sex conspecific, male (but not female) nose-touching with opposite-sex rats was significantly diminished by EDCs. Gene expression profiling was conducted in two brain regions that are part of the social decision-making network in the brain: the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and the ventromedial nucleus (VMN). In both regions, many more genes were affected by A1221 or EB in females than males. In female MPN, A1221 changed expression of steroid hormone receptor and neuropeptide genes (e.g., Ar, Esr1, Esr2, and Kiss1). In male MPN, only Per2 was affected by A1221. The VMN had a number of genes affected by EB compared to vehicle (females: Kiss1, Kiss1r, Pgr; males: Crh) but not A1221. These differences between EB and A1221 indicate that the mechanism of action of A1221 goes beyond estrogenic pathways.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of perinatal exposure to BPA on the spermatogenic capacity of male offspring, and to explore the possible influence of inflammatory responses in BPA reproductive toxicity. Twenty-one pregnant C57BL/6mice were randomly divided into three groups: a control group, a group receiving 0.2 μg/mL (LBPA), and a group receiving 2 μg/mL of BPA (HBPA), all via drinking water from gestational day 6 to the end of lactation. After weaning, one male mouse was randomly selected from each group (n = 7/group); these three mice were fed a normal diet and drinking water for 1 month. Levels of serum testosterone (T) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were then measured in all mice. Sperm count and the proportion of sperm malformation were also determined. The levels of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein expression in the testis tissue were determined. Analysis showed that the proportion of sperm malformation increased in the LBPA and HBPA groups (p < 0.05). Sperm count significantly decreased only in the HBPA group (p < 0.05), while the levels of serum TNF-α increased in the LBPA and HBPA groups (p < 0.05). Levels of serum T decreased significantly in the HBPA group, compared with controls (p < 0.05). Levels of TLR4 and NF-κB protein expression in the testis were significantly higher in the LBPA and HBPA groups (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), while AhR protein expression was higher and seminiferous tubules in the testis showed more damage in the HBPA group compared to controls (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Our results showed that perinatal exposure to low or high doses of BPA decreased the capacity for spermatogenesis in male offspring, which may be associated with an inflammatory response activated by the TLR4/ NF-κB and AhR signaling pathways in the testis.",PMC6210657

In human placenta, the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), encoded by the ABCB1 gene, extrudes its substrates from the trophoblasts back into the maternal circulation. Alterations in levels of placental P-gp could therefore significantly affect fetal exposure to xenobiotics that are P-gp substrates. The ABCB1 promoter contains many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In the genome, SNPs are not arrayed as independent variants but as combinations forming defined haplotypes. Recently, we determined the haplotype sequences encompassing the ABCB1 promoter SNPs and found that promoter haplotypes differentially affect ABCB1 promoter activity. Here we investigate the effect of BPA and BPS on ABCB1 promoter activity by testing the hypothesis that BPA and BPS exposure affect ABCB1 promoter activity in a haplotype-dependent manner. Our data indicate that acute exposure to 50 nM BPA induced a significant haplotype-dependent increase in ABCB1 promoter activity (P < .05). However, acute exposure to 0.5 nM BPS induced a significant decrease (P < .05) in promoter activity that was haplotype-dependent. Chronic exposure to BPA and BPS individually (5 nM and 0.3 nM, respectively) or as a mixture (5 nM BPA:1.5 nM BPS) induced significant haplotype-dependent increases (P < .01) in ABCB1 promoter activity. Our data indicate that BPA and BPS significantly alter ABCB1 promoter activity in a haplotype- and exposure type- dependent manners.

Yet, regulatory agencies have argued that NMDRCs are not common, are not found for adverse outcomes, and are not relevant for regulation of EDCs. Under the linear dose response model, high dose testing is used to extrapolate to lower doses that are anticipated to be 'safe' for human exposures. NMDRCs that occur below the toxicological no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) would falsify a fundamental assumption, that high dose hazards can be used to predict low dose safety. In this commentary, we provide examples of NMDRCs and discuss how their presence in different portions of the dose response curve might affect regulatory decisions. We provide evidence that NMDRCs do occur below the NOAEL dose, and even below the 'safe' reference dose, for chemicals such as resveratrol, permethrin, chlorothalonil, and phthalates such as DEHP. We also briefly discuss the recent CLARITY-BPA study, which reported mammary adenocarcinomas only in rats exposed to the lowest BPA dose. We conclude our commentary with suggestions for how NMDRCs should be acknowledged and utilized to improve regulatory toxicity testing and in the calculation of reference doses that are public health protective.",PMC6137554

Subsequent rodent studies demonstrated developmental effects of exposure with repercussions on adult health and fertility (e.g., [2-9]; reviewed in [10-17]). Studies in monkeys, humans, fish, and worms suggest BPA effects extend across species (e.g., [18-30]; reviewed in [31-33]). Widespread use has resulted in ubiquitous environmental contamination and human BPA exposure. Consumer concern resulted in ""BPA-free"" products produced using structurally similar bisphenols that are now detectable environmental and human contaminants (e.g., [34-41]). We report here studies initiated by meiotic changes mirroring our previous BPA experience and implicating exposure to BPS (a common BPA replacement) from damaged polysulfone cages. Like with BPA [1, 2, 5], our data show that exposure to common replacement bisphenols induces germline effects in both sexes that may affect multiple generations. These findings add to growing evidence of the biological risks posed by this class of chemicals. Rapid production of structural variants of BPA and other EDCs circumvents efforts to eliminate dangerous chemicals, exacerbates the regulatory burden of safety assessment, and increases environmental contamination. Our experience suggests that these environmental contaminants pose a risk not only to reproductive health but also to the integrity of the research environment. EDCs, like endogenous hormones, can affect diverse processes. The sensitivity of the germline allows us to detect effects that, although not immediately apparent in other systems, may induce variability that undermines experimental reproducibility and impedes scientific advancement.",PMC6156992

Limited evidence suggests consequences on the F2 generation, exposed as germ cells within the F1 fetus. These F2s provide a unique window into the programming effects of EDCs. This study assessed intergenerational effects of EDC exposure on adult physiology and behavior in Sprague-Dawley rats. Pregnant rats were exposed to either a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture, Aroclor 1,221 (A1221), the fungicide vinclozolin (VIN), or the vehicle (VEH) (6% dimethylsulfoxide in sesame oil) alone. A1221 is weakly estrogenic, while VIN is antiandrogenic, enabling us to compare different classes of EDCs. The F1 male and female offspring were bred to generate the paternal- and maternal-lineage F2 generation. This F2 generation was assessed for physiological outcomes, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), and sexual behavior in adulthood. Each EDC caused phenotypic effects in a sex- and lineage-dependent manner. The most robustly affected group was the paternal-lineage males. F2 VIN paternal male descendants had increased body weight throughout the lifespan, lower concentrations of circulating estradiol, and lower adrenal and testicular indices. Both VIN and A1221 paternal-lineage males also exhibited the greatest number of changes in the characteristics of USVs in response to an opposite-sex animal and changes in sexual behaviors in a mating test. Exposure of rats to EDCs at the germ cell stage led to differences in the physiological and behavioral phenotype later in life, especially in males.

Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates are widespread environmental contaminants and endocrine disruptors, and the placental epigenetic response to these chemicals is an area of growing research interest. Therefore, our objective was to summarize research linking BPA or phthalate exposure to placental outcomes in human pregnancies, with a particular focus on epigenetic endpoints. In PubMed, studies were selected for review (without limiting start date and ending on 1 May 2018) if they reported any direct effects of BPA or phthalates on the placenta in humans. Collectively, available studies suggest that BPA and phthalate exposures are associated with changes to placental micro-RNA expression, DNA methylation, and genomic imprinting. Furthermore, several studies suggest that fetal sex may be an important modifier of placental outcomes in response to these chemicals. Studies in humans demonstrate associations of BPA and phthalate exposure with adverse placental outcomes. Moving forward, more studies should consider sex differences (termed ""placental sex"") in the measured outcomes, and should utilize appropriate statistical approaches to assess modification by fetal sex. Furthermore, more consistent sample collection and molecular outcome assessment paradigms will be indispensable for making progress in the field.

In modern lifestyle, humans are exposed to several endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which may lead to reproductive disturbances. Diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP) is one of the common EDCs to which women are exposed by the use of cosmetics, perfumes, food packaging, medicine, and insecticides. The aim of this study was to measure the levels of DEHP in women diagnosed with endometriosis and healthy females and to compare these levels among different stages of endometriosis. This descriptive study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital. This study comprised of fifty women diagnosed with endometriosis, aged 20-40 years, and fifty age-matched healthy, fertile women without endometriosis. Females on any medication/comorbid conditions were excluded from the study. Serum DEHP concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results were expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD) (ng/ml of DEHP). Data were analyzed using IBM-SPSS version 20. Two-sample Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA were applied for the analysis. The mean ± SD value of DEHP in cases was 65.29 ± 21.69 ng/ml; however, the mean ± SD value of DEHP in controls was undetectable. Comparison of DEHP among stages of endometriosis revealed an increasing trend with advanced stages (III and IV). The values were not different between the two age groups of women with endometriosis (20-30 and 31-40 years). High levels of DEHP in women diagnosed with endometriosis suggest a role of phthalates in the etiology of endometriosis and permit careful use of such compounds.",PMC6094529

Total breast volume (BV), fibroglandular volume (FGV), and percent dense breast (%FGV) were evaluated at B4 using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Generalized estimating equations were used to analyze the association between concentrations of EDC biomarkers across puberty and breast density. The geometric mean %FGV was 7% higher among girls in the highest relative to the lowest tertile of monocarboxyisooctyl phthalate [1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-1.14]. Monoethyl phthalate concentrations at B4 were positively associated with FGV (highest vs. lowest tertile: 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.40). Bisphenol A displayed a U-shaped association with FGV; girls in the middle tertile had at least 10% lower FGV than girls in the lowest or highest tertiles. Monocarboxyisononyl phthalate showed a nonlinear association with BV. No other statistically significant associations were observed. Our results suggest that the developing breast tissue is susceptible to select EDCs during childhood and adolescence.

As adipogenesis is a critical factor contributing to obesity, we determined the effects of in vivo maternal BPA and in vitro BPA exposure on newborn adipose tissue at the stem-cell level. For in vivo studies, female rats received BPA before and during pregnancy and lactation via drinking water, and offspring were studied for measures of adiposity signals. For in vitro BPA exposure, primary pre-adipocyte cell cultures from healthy newborns were utilized. We studied pre-adipocyte proliferative and differentiation effects of BPA and explored putative signal factors which partly explain adipose responses and underlying epigenetic mechanisms mediated by BPA. Maternal BPA-induced offspring adiposity, hypertrophic adipocytes and increased adipose tissue protein expression of pro-adipogenic and lipogenic factors. Consistent with in vivo data, in vitro BPA exposure induced a dose-dependent increase in pre-adipocyte proliferation and increased adipocyte lipid content. In vivo and in vitro BPA exposure promotes the proliferation and differentiation of adipocytes, contributing to an enhanced capacity for lipid storage. These findings reinforce the marked effects of BPA on adipogenesis and highlight the susceptibility of stem-cell populations during early life with long-term consequence on metabolic homeostasis.",PMC6363869

Their potential endocrine-disrupting activities may depend on both inhibitory AhR-ER cross-talk and on AhR-dependent metabolic production of estrogenic PAH metabolites. Here, we analyzed the impact of AhR on estrogen-like effects of PAHs, such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), in particular, on control of cell cycle progression/cell proliferation. Using AhR knockout variant of estrogen-sensitive human breast cancer MCF-7 cells (MCF-7 AhRKO cells), we observed that the AhR-dependent control of cytochrome P450 family 1 (CYP1) expression played a major role in formation of estrogenic BaP metabolites, most notably 3-OH-BaP, which contributed to the ER-dependent induction of cell cycle progression/cell proliferation. Both BaP metabolism and the BaP-induced S-phase transition/cell proliferation were inhibited in MCF-7 AhRKO cells, whereas these cells remained sensitive towards both endogenous estrogen 17β-estradiol or hydroxylated BaP metabolites. BaP was found to increase the activity of ER-dependent luciferase reporter gene in wild-type MCF-7 cells; however, unlike its hydroxylated metabolite, BaP failed to stimulate luciferase activity in MCF-7 AhRKO cells. Similarly, estrogen-like effects of other known estrogenic PAHs, such as benz[a]anthracene or 3-methylcholanthrene, were diminished in MCF-7 AhRKO cells. Ectopic expression of human CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 enzymes partly restored both BaP metabolism and its effects on cell proliferation. Taken together, our data suggest that the AhR-dependent metabolism of PAHs contributes significantly to the impact of PAHs on cell proliferation in estrogen-sensitive cells.",PMC6154273

We measured urine BPA levels and LINE-1 hydroxymethylation in 158 male factory workers selected from an occupational cohort study conducted in China between 2004 and 2008. Among them, there were 72 male workers with occupational BPA exposure (BPA-exposed group) and 86 male workers without occupational BPA exposure (unexposed group). Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the association of exposure to BPA with LINE-1 hydroxymethylation. LINE-1 was more highly hydroxymethylated in the BPA-exposed group than in the unexposed group (median 12.97% vs. 9.68%, respectively; p < 0.05), after adjusting for the potential confounders. The medians of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) generally increased with increasing urine BPA levels: 8.79%, 12.16%, 11.53%, and 13.45%, for undetected BPA and corresponding tertiles for the detected BPA, respectively.

This study aimed to determine whether early-life exposure to BPA and its related analogues, bisphenol AF (BPAF) and bisphenol S (BPS), could affect female pubertal mammary gland development and long-term mammary health in mice. Timed pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed to vehicle, BPA (0.5, 5, 50 mg/kg), BPAF (0.05, 0.5, 5 mg/kg), or BPS (0.05, 0.5, 5 mg/kg) via oral gavage between gestation days 10–17. Mammary glands were collected from resulting female offspring at postnatal day (PND) 20, 28, 35, and 56, and at 3, 8, and 14 months for whole mount, histopathological evaluation, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR); serum steroid concentrations were also measured at these time points. In the bisphenol-exposed mice, accelerated mammary gland development was evident during early puberty and persisted into adulthood. By late adulthood, mammary glands from bisphenol-exposed female offspring exhibited adverse morphology in comparison with controls; most prominent were undifferentiated duct ends, significantly more lobuloalveolar hyperplasia and perivascular inflammation, and various tumors, including adenocarcinomas. Effects were especially prominent in the BPAF 5 mg/kg and BPS 0.5 mg/kg groups. Serum steroid concentrations and mammary mRNA levels of Esr1, Pgr, Ar, and Gper1 were similar to controls. These data demonstrate that prenatal exposure of mice to BPAF or BPS induced precocious development of the mammary gland, and that siblings were significantly more susceptible to spontaneous preneoplastic epithelial lesions and inflammation, with an incidence greater than that observed in vehicle- and BPA-exposed animals. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3189.",PMC6108869

Here, we show that BPA and NP induce apoptosis in prostate and ovary cancer cell lines, in a process dependent on ADAM17 activation. ADAM17 knockdown completely prevented apoptosis as well as the shedding of ADAM17 substrates. Both compounds were found to induce an increase in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) only in Ca2+-containing medium, with the NP-treated cells response being more robust than those treated with BPA. Additionally, using a phosphorylated protein microarray, we found that both compounds stimulate common intracellular pathways related to cell growth, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. These results suggest that BPA and NP could induce apoptosis through ADAM17 by activating different intracellular signaling pathways that may converge in different cellular responses, one of which is apoptosis. These results confirm the capacity of these compounds to induce cell apoptosis in cancer cell lines and uncover ADAM17 as a key regulator of this process in response to EDCs.",PMC6121659

In this study, ovarian estrogen (E2), bisphenol A (BPA), or 4-tert-octylphenol (OP), with or without ICI 182,780 (ICI) were injected subcutaneously from gestation day 1 to gestation day 3 post-coitus. The expression levels of the calcium transport genes were assessed in maternal uteri and implantation sites. The number of implantation sites was significantly low in the OP group, and implantation sites were absent in the E2, ICI and EDs + ICI groups. There were different calcium transient transport channel expression levels in uterus and implantation site samples. The levels of TRPV5 and TRPV6 gene expression were significantly increased by EDs with/without ICI treatment in utero. Meanwhile, TRPV5 and TRPV6 gene expression were significantly lower in implantation sites samples. NCX1 and PMCA1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased by OP and BPA in the implantation site samples.

Yet, an increasing number of studies have shown that pregnant females are disrupted by endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures, with some effects that are permanent. Here, we examined the long-term effects of exposure to oxybenzone, an estrogenic chemical found in sunscreen and personal care products, on the morphology of the mammary gland in mice exposed during pregnancy and lactation. Female mice were exposed to vehicle or 30, 212, or 3000 µg oxybenzone/kg/d, from pregnancy day 0 until weaning. A nulliparous group, receiving vehicle treatment, was also evaluated. Mammary glands were collected 5 weeks after involution for whole-mount, histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular analyses. Exposure to 3000 µg oxybenzone/kg/d induced permanent changes to ductal density that was significantly different from both the nulliparous and vehicle groups. The two highest doses of oxybenzone similarly induced an intermediate phenotype for expression of progesterone receptor. A monotonic, dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation was also observed in the oxybenzone-treated females, becoming statistically significant at the highest dose. Finally, oxybenzone exposure induced an intermediate phenotype for Esr1 expression in all oxybenzone-treated groups. These data suggest that oxybenzone, at doses relevant to human exposures, produces long-lasting alterations to mammary gland morphology and function. Further studies are needed to determine if exposure to this chemical during pregnancy and lactation will interfere with the known protection that pregnancy provides against breast cancer.",PMC6057512

We investigated if low-dose developmental BPA exposure affects DNA methylation and expression of Grin2b in brains of adult rats.

We found that Grin2b mRNA expression was increased and DNA methylation decreased in female, but not in male rats. In humans, prenatal BPA exposure was associated with increased methylation levels in girls. Additionally, low APGAR scores, a predictor for increased risk for neurodevelopmental diseases, were associated with higher Grin2b methylation levels in girls. Thus, we could link developmental BPA exposure and low APGAR scores to changes in the epigenetic regulation of Grin2b, a gene important for neuronal function, in a sexual dimorphic fashion.

This region is particularly important given its involvement in executive functions and implication in the pathology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we examine the long-term effects of perinatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds, the phthalates, on the mPFC and associated behavior. This investigation is pertinent as humans are ubiquitously exposed to phthalates through a variety of consumer products and phthalates can readily cross the placenta and be delivered to offspring via lactation. Pregnant dams orally consumed an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalates at 0, 200, or 1000 μg/kg/d through pregnancy and for 10 d while lactating. As adults, offspring were tested in an attentional set-shifting task, which assesses cognitive flexibility. Brains were also examined in adulthood for stereological quantification of the number of neurons, glia, and synapses within the mPFC. We found that, independent of sex, perinatal phthalate exposure at either dose resulted in a reduction in neuron number, synapse number, and size of the mPFC and a deficit in cognitive flexibility. Interestingly, the number of synapses was correlated with cognitive flexibility, such that rats with fewer synapses were less cognitively flexible than those with more synapses. These results demonstrate that perinatal phthalate exposure can have long-term effects on the cortex and behavior of both male and female rats.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans globally are exposed on a daily basis to a variety of phthalates, which are endocrine-disrupting chemicals. The effects of phthalate exposure on the developing brain, especially on cognitively relevant regions, such as the mPFC, are not known.

Three genes (Bdnf, Dnmt3b, and Esr1) were studied for DNA methylation changes in their putative 5' promoter regions. Molecular changes in hippocampus were correlated to prior Barnes maze performance, including sniffing correct holes, distance traveled, and velocity. Exposure to BPA and/or EE disrupted patterns of sexually dimorphic gene expression/promoter DNA methylation observed in hippocampus and hypothalamus of controls. In the hippocampus of female offspring, BPA exposure resulted in hypermethylation of the putative 5' promoter region of Bdnf, while EE exposure induced hypomethylation. Bdnf methylation was weakly associated with Bdnf expression in hippocampi of female rats. Hippocampal Bdnf expression in females showed a weak negative association with sniffing correct hole in Barnes maze.

BPA analogs, such as the bisphenols S, F, and AF (BPS, BPF, and BPAF) are increasingly used as replacement chemicals, although they were found to exert estrogenic effects similar to those of BPA. Research has shown that only the parent compounds have affinity to the estrogen receptors, suggesting that the pharmacokinetic behavior of bisphenols (BPs) can influence their potency. Our goal was to compare the pharmacokinetic behaviors of BPA, BPS, BPF, and BPAF for different age groups after environmentally relevant external exposures by taking into account substance-specific metabolism kinetics and partitioning behavior. This comparison allowed us to investigate the consequences of replacing BPA with other BPs. We readjusted a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for peroral exposure to BPA and extended it to include dermal exposure. We experimentally assessed hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation kinetics of BPS, BPF, and BPAF to parametrize the model for these BPs and calibrated the BPS model with a biomonitoring study. We used the PBPK models to compare resulting internal exposures and focused on females of childbearing age in a two-dimensional Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. Within environmentally relevant concentration ranges, BPAF and BPS were glucuronized at highest and lowest rates, respectively, in the intestine and the liver. The predominant routes of BPS and BPAF exposure were peroral and dermal exposure, respectively. The calibration of the BPS model with measured concentrations showed that enterohepatic recirculation may be important. Assuming equal external exposures, BPS exposure led to the highest internal concentrations of unconjugated BPs. Our data suggest that the replacement of BPA with structural analogs may not lower the risk for endocrine disruption. Exposure to both BPS and BPAF might be more critical than BPA exposure, if their respective estrogenic potencies are taken into account. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2739.",PMC6108829

Infant birth weight and head circumference were abstracted from delivery records. Mean preconception and prenatal exposures were estimated by averaging urinary ln-BPA and ln-BPS concentrations in multiple maternal and paternal urine samples collected before pregnancy, and maternal pregnancy samples collected in each trimester. Maternal preconception urinary BPA concentrations were inversely associated with birth weight and head circumference in adjusted models: each ln-unit increase was associated with a decrease in birth weight of 119 g (95% CI: -212, -27), and a head circumference decrease of 0.72 cm (95% CI: -1.3, -0.1). Additional adjustment by gestational age or prenatal BPA exposure modestly attenuated results. Women with higher prenatal BPA concentrations had infants with lower mean birth weight (-75 g, 95% CI: -153, 2) although this did not achieve statistical significance.

Early life exposures to DEHP may result in anti-androgenic effects, impairing the development of the male reproductive tract. However, data on the long-lasting consequences of such DEHP exposures on adult male reproductive function are still rare and discrepant. Previously, we identified 2 novel plasticizers, 1,4-butanediol dibenzoate (BDB) and dioctyl succinate (DOS), as potential substitutes for DEHP that did not reproduce classically described endocrine disrupting phenotypes in prepubertal male offspring after maternal exposure. Here, we investigated the consequences of in utero and lactational exposure to BDB and DOS on adult male rat reproductive function in a comparative study with DEHP and a commercially available alternative plasticizer, 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH). Timed pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged with vehicle or a test chemical (30 or 300 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 8 to postnatal day 21. While DEHP exposure (300 mg/kg/day) significantly increased epididymal weight in the adult, exposure to DINCH, BDB, or DOS did not affect reproductive organ weights, steroid levels, or sperm quality. Using a toxicogenomic microarray approach, we found that adult testicular gene expression was affected by exposure to the higher dose of DEHP; transcripts such as Nr5a2, Ltf, or Runx2 were significantly downregulated, suggesting that DEHP was targeting estrogen signaling. Lesser effects were observed after treatment with either DINCH or BDB. DOS exposure did not produce such effects, confirming its potential as a responsible substitute for DEHP.",PMC6016686

We hypothesized that these metabolites bind to the human estrogen receptor (ER) and promote estrogen signaling. We tested this using models of ER-mediated cellular proliferation. The estrogenic properties of 3-hydroxy n-butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (3OH) and 2-hydroxy iso-butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (2OH) were determined using the ER-positive, estrogen-dependent human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, and T47D. The 3OH metabolite induced cellular proliferation with EC50 of 8.2 µM in MCF-7 cells. The EC50 for 3OH in T47D cells could not be reached. The 2OH metabolite induced proliferation with EC50 of 2.2 µM and 43.0 µM in MCF-7 and T47D cells, respectively. The EC50 for the parental IsoBuP and BuP was 0.30 and 1.2 µM in MCF-7 cells, respectively. The expression of a pro-proliferative, estrogen-inducible gene (GREB1) was induced by these compounds and blocked by co-administration of an ER antagonist (ICI 182, 780), confirming the ER-dependence of these effects. The metabolites promoted significant ER-dependent transcriptional activity of an ERE-luciferase reporter construct at 10 and 20 µM for 2OH and 10 µM for 3OH. Computational docking studies showed that the paraben compounds exhibited the potential for favorable ligand-binding domain interactions with human ERα in a manner similar to known x-ray crystal structures of 17ß-estradiol in complex with ERα.

Previous studies have shown California mice developmentally exposed to endocrine disrupting chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA) or ethinyl estradiol (EE), demonstrate later compromised parental behaviors. Reductions in F1 parental behaviors might also be due to decreased emissions of F2 pup vocalizations. Thus, vocalizations of F2 male and female California mice pups born to F1 parents developmentally exposed to BPA, EE, or controls were examined. Postnatal days (PND) 2-4 were considered early postnatal period, PND 7 and 14 were defined as mid-postnatal period, and PND 21 and 28 were classified as late postnatal period. EE pups showed increased latency to emit the first syllable compared to controls. BPA female pups had decreased syllable duration compared to control and EE female pups during the early postnatal period but enhanced responses compared to controls at late postnatal period; whereas, male BPA and EE pups showed greater syllable duration compared to controls during early postnatal period. In mid-postnatal period, F2 BPA and EE pups emitted greater number of phrases than F2 control pups. Results indicate aspects of vocalizations were disrupted in F2 pups born to F1 parents developmentally exposed to BPA or EE, but their responses were not always identical, suggesting BPA might not activate estrogen receptors to the same extent as EE.

Despite its high prevalence, the exact pathogenesis of the benign tumor remains unknown. In the present study, the effects of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on the proliferation and apoptosis rates and expression of inflammatory proteins in human leiomyoma cells were evaluated. The effects of DEHP on cell viability were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The effects on apoptosis were evaluated by western blotting, TUNEL assay and Annexin V staining. Western blotting was also performed to evaluate the expression of inflammatory proteins. It was observed that DEHP-treated leiomyoma cells had higher viability, as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein expression, and lower apoptosis rates compared with the untreated controls. Additionally, hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression increased in human leiomyoma cells following DEHP treatment. In conclusion, DEHP promoted cell viability and anti-apoptotic protein expression and induced HIF-1α and COX-2 expression in human leiomyoma cells. These results suggested that DEHP may disrupt mechanisms underlying various processes in human leiomyoma cells. Furthermore, the current study revealed a basic mechanism of action of DEHP in human leiomyoma cells.

However, the underlying mechanisms driving these changes are not well understood. We investigated the molecular perturbations associated with EDC-induced behavioral changes in first (F1) and second (F2) filial generations, using the model EDC bisphenol A (BPA). C57BL/6J dams were exposed to BPA from preconception until lactation through the diet at doses (10 μg/kg bw/d-lower dose or 10 mg/kg bw/d-upper dose) representative of human exposure levels. As adults, F1 male offspring exhibited increased depressive-like behavior, measured by the forced swim test, while females were unaffected. These behavioral changes were limited to the F1 generation and were not associated with altered maternal care. Transcriptome analysis by RNA-sequencing in F1 control and upper dose BPA-exposed adult male hippocampus revealed neurotransmitter systems as major pathways disrupted by developmental BPA exposure. High performance liquid chromatography demonstrated a male-specific reduction in hippocampal serotonin. Administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (20 mg/kg bw) rescued the depressive-like phenotype in males exposed to lower, but not upper, dose BPA, suggesting distinct mechanisms of action for each exposure dose. Finally, high resolution mass spectrometry revealed reduced circulating levels of the neuroactive steroid dehydroepiandrosterone in BPA-exposed males, suggesting another potential mechanism underlying the depressive-like phenotype. Thus, behavioral changes associated with early life BPA exposure may be mediated by sex-specific disruptions in the serotonergic system and/or sex steroid biogenesis in male offspring.",PMC6261494

Long-term exposure to EDCs, even at low doses, has been linked with various health defects including cancer, behavioral disorders, and infertility, with greater vulnerability during early developmental periods. To study the effects of BPA on the development of neuronal function, we used an in vitro neuronal network derived from the early chick embryonic brain as a model. We found that exposure to BPA affected the development of network activity, specifically spiking activity and synchronization. A change in network activity is the crucial link between the molecular target of a drug or compound and its effect on behavioral outcome. Multi-electrode arrays are increasingly becoming useful tools to study the effects of drugs on network activity in vitro. There are several systems available in the market and, although there are variations in the number of electrodes, the type and quality of the electrode array and the analysis software, the basic underlying principles, and the data obtained is the same across the different systems. Although currently limited to analysis of two-dimensional in vitro cultures, these MEA systems are being improved to enable in vivo network activity in brain slices.

An efficient DEHP-degrading bacterial strain Rhodococcus ruber YC-YT1, with super salt tolerance (0⁻12% NaCl), is the first DEHP-degrader isolated from marine plastic debris found in coastal saline seawater. Strain YC-YT1 completely degraded 100 mg/L DEHP within three days (pH 7.0, 30 °C). According to high-performance liquid chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis, DEHP was transformed by strain YC-YT1 into phthalate (PA) via mono (2-ethylehxyl) phthalate (MEHP), then PA was used for cell growth. Furthermore, YC-YT1 metabolized initial concentrations of DEHP ranging from 0.5 to 1000 mg/L. Especially, YC-YT1 degraded up to 60% of the 0.5 mg/L initial DEHP concentration.

This is a time of relative analytical inaccessibility. We have used a large national biobank of amniotic fluid samples collected at routine amniocentesis to determine the impacts of exogenous endocrine disruptor load on specific fetal biomarkers at this critical time. While adrenal and testicular steroids are highly correlated, they are also mostly positively influenced by increasing phthalate load, represented by the metabolites 7cx-MMeHP and 5cx-MEPP, by perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure, and by smoking, suggesting an adrenal stress response. In contrast, the testis specific biomarkers insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) and androstenedione are negatively impacted by the phthalate endocrine disruptors. Using a case-control design, we show that cryptorchidism and hypospadias are both significantly associated with increased amniotic concentration of INSL3 during gestational weeks 13-16, and some, though not all steroid biomarkers. Cases are also linked to a specifically increased variance in the Leydig cell biomarker INSL3 compared to controls, an effect exacerbated by maternal smoking. No influence of phthalate metabolites or PFOS was evident on the distribution of cases and controls. Considering that several animal and human studies have shown a negative impact of phthalate load on fetal and cord blood INSL3, respectively, the present results suggest that such endocrine disruptors may rather be altering the relative dynamics of testicular development and consequent hormone production, leading to a desynchronization of tissue organization during fetal development.

This study aims to quantify annual cumulated phthalate exposure from drug products among users of phthalate-containing oral medications in Denmark throughout the period of 2004-2016. We conducted a Danish nationwide cohort study using The Danish National Prescription Registry and an internal database held by The Danish Medicines Agency. These databases hold information on drug products; date of dispensing, and the type and quantity of excipients in drugs with Danish marketing permission. We present the number of users over time and their distribution of exposure to enteric phthalate polymers and ortho-phthalates. The annual number of individuals exposed to phthalate-containing products declined during 2004-2016. The total number of individuals exposed to dibutyl phthalate declined from 21 499 in 2004 to 5400 in 2016. However, among those exposed, the median dibutyl phthalate exposure remained above European regulatory limit of exposure ranging between 380-1710 mg/year throughout the study period. Lithium-products constituted the majority of dibutyl phthalate exposure. Diethyl phthalate exposure, mainly caused by erythromycin, theophylline and diclofenac products, did not exceed the EMA regulatory limit.

TASH has previously been characterized by hepatocellular necrosis, disrupted intermediary metabolism, and liver inflammation. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are environmental EDCs/MDCs associated with the genesis and progression of steatohepatitis in animal models and human liver injury in epidemiology studies. The cross-sectional Anniston Community Health Survey (ACHS) investigates ortho-substituted PCB exposures and health effects near a former PCB manufacturing complex. The rates of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were previously determined to be high in ACHS. In this study, 738 ACHS participants were categorized by liver disease status using the serum cytokeratin 18 biomarker. Associations between PCB exposures and mechanistic biomarkers of intermediary metabolism, inflammation, and hepatocyte death were determined. The liver disease prevalence was high (60.2%), and 80.7% of these individuals were categorized as having TASH. Sex and race/ethnicity differences were noted. TASH was associated with increased exposures to specific PCB congeners, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, proinflammatory cytokines, and liver necrosis. These findings are consistent with PCB-related steatohepatitis. ΣPCBs was inversely associated with insulin resistance/production, leptin, and hepatocyte apoptosis, while other adipocytokines were increased. This is possibly the largest environmental liver disease study applying mechanistic biomarkers ever performed and the most comprehensive analysis of PCBs and adipocytokines. It provides insight into the mechanisms of PCB-related endocrine and metabolic disruption in liver disease and diabetes.

Among such EDCs are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), a class of industrial chemicals. PCB exposure in utero leads to alterations in mating behaviors and other sexually dimorphic social interactions in rats. Many of the previous studies on social behavior gave the experimental animal a single or binary choice. This study applied a more complex behavioral apparatus, an X-shaped Plexiglas apparatus (FourPlex), that enabled an experimental animal exposed to PCBs or a vehicle to distinguish and choose among 4 stimulus animals of the same or opposite sex, and of different hormonal status. We found that rats were able to differentiate among the stimuli in the FourPlex and showed the expected preference for an opposite sex, hormone-treated rat, particularly for behaviors conducted in proximity. Prenatal treatment caused subtle shifts in behavior toward stimulus rats in the FourPlex; more robust effects were seen for the sexual dimorphisms in behavior. Importantly, the results differ from our previous results of a simple binary choice model, showing that how an animal behaves in a more complex social paradigm does not predict the outcome in a simple choice model, and vice versa.

Environmental factors can influence gene expression and cell function by modifying epigenetic marks, impacting the developing embryo as well as future generations of offspring. The impact of phthalates on placental gene methylation and expression is largely unknown. We studied the effect of maternal phthalate exposure on the human placental DNA methylome and transcriptome. We determined epigenome-wide DNA methylation marks (Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 850k BeadChip) and gene expression (Agilent whole human genome array) associated with phthalate exposure in first trimester placenta. Integrative genomic analysis of candidate genes was performed to define gene methylation-expression relationships. We identified 39 genes with significantly altered methylation and gene expression in the high phthalate exposure group. Most of these relationships were inversely correlated. This analysis identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a critical candidate gene mediating the effects of phthalates on early placental function. Although additional studies are needed to determine the functional consequences of these changes, our findings are consistent with the model that phthalates impact placental function by modulating the expression of critical placental genes through epigenetic regulation.",PMC5904105

Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) plays a role in mediating these developmental effects. However, the developmental mechanism is not well known in male tissues. Here, we present genome-wide transcriptome and DNA methylation profiling of the seminal vesicles (SVs) during normal development and after DES exposure. ERα mediates aberrations of the mRNA transcriptome in SVs of adult mice following neonatal DES exposure. This developmental exposure impacts differential diseases between male (SVs) and female (uterus) tissues when mice reach adulthood due to most DES-altered genes that appear to be tissue specific during mouse development. Certain estrogen-responsive gene changes in SVs are cell-type specific. DNA methylation dynamically changes during development in the SVs of wild-type (WT) and ERα-knockout (αERKO) mice, which increases both the loss and gain of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). There are more gains of DMRs in αERKO compared with WT. Interestingly, the methylation changes between the two genotypes are in different genomic loci. Additionally, the expression levels of a subset of DES-altered genes are associated with their DNA methylation status following developmental DES exposure. Taken together, these findings provide an important basis for understanding the molecular and cellular mechanism of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such as DES, during development in the male mouse tissues.

Identifying and characterizing toxic hazards based on the manner by which adverse effects are produced rather than on the nature of those adverse effects departs from traditional practice and requires a proper interpretation of the evidence regarding the chemical's ability to produce physiological effect(s) via a specific mode of action (MoA). The ability of any chemical to produce a physiological effect depends on its pharmacokinetics and the potency by which it acts via the various MoAs that can lead to the particular effect. A chemical's potency for a specific MoA-its mechanistic potency-is determined by two properties: (1) its affinity for the functional components that comprise the MoA, i.e., its specific receptors, enzymes, transporters, transcriptional elements, etc., and (2) its ability to alter the functional state of those components (activity). Using the agonist MoA via estrogen receptor alpha, we illustrate an empirical method for determining a human-relevant potency threshold (HRPT), defined as the minimum level of mechanistic potency necessary for a chemical to be able to act via a particular MoA in humans. One important use for an HRPT is to distinguish between chemicals that may be capable of, versus those likely to be incapable of, producing adverse effects in humans via the specified MoA. The method involves comparing chemicals that have different ERα agonist potencies with the ability of those chemicals to produce ERα-mediated agonist responses in human clinical trials. Based on this approach, we propose an HRPT for ERα agonism of 1E-04 relative to the potency of the endogenous estrogenic hormone 17β-estradiol or the pharmaceutical estrogen, 17α-ethinylestradiol. This approach provides a practical way to address Hazard Identification according to the draft criteria for identification of EDCs recently proposed by the European Commission.",PMC5962616

We seek to determine the relationship between several known endocrine disrupting compounds and a marker of ovarian responsivity, the FSH:LH ratio (higher ratio indicates less ovarian responsivity). For this analysis, 169 naturally cycling women between 21 and 38 years of age completed interviews and had their blood drawn on day 3 of their menstrual cycle for analyses of toxicants, gonadal sex hormones (E2 and P4), and gonadotropins (FSH and LH). PCB congeners were classified into five groups based on their environmental persistence, distribution in human tissue, and toxicological action, reflecting the structure, mechanism, and known biological activity of individual PCB congeners. For every unit (ppb) increase in the level of the estrogenic PCB group, there was a 5-fold greater risk of a FSH:LH ratio ≥ 2, controlling for individual differences in age, percent body fat, cycle day 3 estradiol levels, parity, alcohol use and cigarette smoking in the past year (exp[ß] = 5; p = ≤0.01). PCB congeners identified as estrogenic were analyzed individually, and, of the 19 potentially estrogenic congeners, five were significantly, and positively related to an increased FSH:LH ratio. Four of these congeners are non-persistent, easily volatilize in the environment, and are easily metabolized, and hence, are indicative of very recent or current exposure. p,p'-DDE and HCB were not associated with FSH:LH ratio. We find a clinical indicator of ovarian responsivity, FSH:LH ratio, is associated with a specific group of estrogenic PCBs. These congeners may become airborne when they volatilize from dredged PCB-contaminated soil or from indoor PCB-containing window caulk and sealants in older buildings leading to inhalation exposure.

These EDCs were quantified in urine collected prior to the onset of breast development (Tanner 1; B1), and during adolescence (Tanner 4; B4). Multivariable accelerated failure time (AFT) models were used to analyze associations between biomarker concentrations and the age of menarche adjusting for body mass index (BMI) Z-score and maternal education, accounting for within-subject correlation. Several biomarkers were significantly associated with the age at menarche; however, these associations were dependent on the timing of biomarker assessment. A log(ng/ml) increase in B1 concentrations of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate biomarkers was associated with later menarche (hazard ratio (HR): 0.77; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.98), whereas higher B1 concentrations of 2,5-dichlorophenol and benzophenone-3 were associated with earlier menarche (HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.27; HR: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29, respectively).

We measured nine phthalate metabolites [monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-n-butyl phthalate, mono-isobutyl phthalate, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and four monoesthers of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] in urine collected at approximately 16 and 26 weeks' gestation among women in the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study (2003-2006, Cincinnati, Ohio). Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free and total thyroxine and triiodothyronine were measured in maternal serum at 16 weeks' gestation (n = 202) and cord serum at delivery (n = 276). We used multivariable linear regression to assess associations between individual urinary phthalate metabolites and concentrations of maternal or cord serum thyroid hormones. We used weighted quantile sum regression (WQS) to create a phthalate index describing combined concentrations of phthalate metabolites and to investigate associations of the phthalate index with individual thyroid hormones. With each 10-fold increase in 16-week maternal urinary MEP, maternal serum total thyroxine (TT4) decreased by 0.52 μg/dL (95% CI: -1.01, -0.03). For each 10-fold increase in average (16- and 26-week) maternal urinary MBzP, cord serum TSH decreased by 19% (95% CI: -33.1, -1.9). Among mothers, the phthalate index was inversely associated with maternal serum TT4 (WQS beta = -0.60; 95% CI: -1.01, -0.18).

The tested LC-PCBs were also partial constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonists, with PCB 4, 8 and 18 being the most active compounds. They were inactive towards other nuclear receptors, such as vitamin D receptor, thyroid receptor α, glucocorticoid receptor or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. We found that only PCB 8 contributed to generation of oxidative stress, while all tested LC-PCBs induced arachidonic acid release (albeit without further modulations of arachidonic acid metabolism) in human lung epithelial cells. Importantly, estrogenic effects of hydroxylated (OH-PCB) metabolites of LC-PCBs (4-OH-PCB 8, 4-OH-PCB 11 and 4'-OH-PCB 18) were higher than those of the parent PCBs, while their other toxic effects were only slightly altered or suppressed. This suggested that metabolism may alter toxicity profiles of LC-PCBs in a receptor-specific manner.

In the Michigan Mother-Infant Pairs (MMIP) cohort, DNA was extracted from cord blood leukocytes for methylation analysis by pyrosequencing (n = 116) and methylation changes related to first trimester levels of 9 phthalate metabolites and BPA. Growth and metabolism-related genes selected for methylation analysis included imprinted (IGF2, H19) and non-imprinted (PPARA, ESR1) genes along with LINE-1 repetitive elements. Findings revealed decreases in methylation of LINE-1, IGF2, and PPARA with increasing phthalate concentrations. For example, a log unit increase in ΣDEHP corresponded to a 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.83, -0.22] percentage point decrease in PPARA methylation. Changes in DNA methylation were also inversely correlated with PPARA gene expression determined by RT-qPCR (r = -0.34, P = 0.02), thereby providing evidence in support of functional relevance. A sex-stratified analysis of EDCs and DNA methylation showed that some relationships were female-specific.

Environmental toxicants that compromise TSC function could impact fetal viability, pregnancy, and progeny health. Understanding the effects of low, chronic EDC exposures on TSCs and pregnancy is a priority in developmental toxicology. Differences in early implantation between primates and other mammals make a nonhuman primate model ideal. We examined effects of chronic low-level exposure to atrazine, tributyltin, bisphenol A, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and perfluorooctanoic acid on rhesus monkey TSCs in vitro by RNA sequencing. Pathway analysis of affected genes revealed negative effects on cytokine signaling related to anti-viral response, most strongly for atrazine and tributyltin, but shared with the other three EDCs. Other affected processes included metabolism, DNA repair, and cell migration. Low-level chronic exposure of primate TSCs to EDCs may thus compromise trophoblast development in vivo, inhibit responses to infection, and negatively affect embryo implantation and pregnancy.",PMC5898618

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a suspected endocrine disruptor and a common environmental pollutant associated with various diseases including cancer. However, the effects of PFOA and its mechanisms of action on hormone-responsive cells remain unclear. Here, we explored the potential tumorigenic activity of PFOA (100 nM-1 mM) in human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). MCF-10A cells exposed to 50 and 100 µM PFOA demonstrated a higher growth rate compared to controls. The compound promoted MCF-10A proliferation by accelerating G0/G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. PFOA increased cyclin D1 and CDK4/6 levels, concomitant with a decrease in p27. In contrast to previous studies of perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 had no effect on PFOA-induced cell proliferation, whereas the PPARα antagonist GW 6471 was able to prevent the MCF-10A proliferation, indicating that the underlying mechanisms involve PPARα-dependent pathways. Interestingly, we also showed that PFOA is able to stimulate cell migration and invasion, demonstrating its potential to induce neoplastic transformation of human breast epithelial cells. These results suggest that more attention should be paid to the roles of PFOA in the development and progression of breast cancer.",PMC5962621

However, human data are limited. Here, we aimed to examine whether urinary phthalate metabolites are correlated with markers of ovarian reserve among women attending a fertility clinic. We measured eight phthalate metabolites in urine samples collected from 415 women seeking infertility treatment at the Reproductive Medicine Center of Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China. Data on measures of ovarian reserve, as indicated by serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B (INHB) levels, were retrieved retrospectively through electronic medical charts. Multivariate linear models were performed to estimate the associations of urinary phthalate metabolites and serum AMH and INHB. We further explored the potential nonlinearity of the relationships with restricted cubic spline analysis. Overall, we found largely null associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and serum AMH. The multivariable adjusted differences in serum INHB levels comparing the highest quartile of urinary MEHP to the lowest were - 18.29% (95% CI: - 31.89%, - 1.98%; P-trend = 0.04). Women in the second to fourth quartiles of MEOHP had a significant decrease of - 23.74% (95% CI: -35.85%, - 9.24%), - 19.91% (95% CI: -33.30%, - 3.82%) and - 20.23% (95% CI: -34.43%, - 2.96%), respectively, in INHB levels compared to the first quartile. In the spline analysis, we identified a nonlinear relationship between MEOHP exposure and serum INHB. We provided evidence for a negative association between urinary concentrations of certain phthalate metabolites and serum INHB levels, suggesting an adverse effect of phthalates exposure on growing antral follicles.

Thus, we tested the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to DEHP accelerates the onset of puberty, disrupts estrous cyclicity, disrupts birth outcomes, and reduces fertility in the F1, F2, and F3 generations of female mice. Pregnant CD-1 mice were orally dosed with corn oil (vehicle control) or DEHP (20 and 200 µg/kg/day and 500 and 750 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 10.5 until birth. F1 females were mated with untreated males to obtain the F2 generation. F2 females were mated with untreated males to produce the F3 generation. In all generations, the onset of puberty, estrous cyclicity, select birth outcomes, and fertility-related indices were evaluated. In the F1 generation, prenatal DEHP exposure (200 µg/kg/day) accelerated the onset of puberty, it (200 µg and 500 mg/kg/day) disrupted estrous cyclicity, and it (20 and 200 µg/kg/day) decreased fertility-related indices. In the F2 generation, ancestral DEHP exposure (500 mg/kg/day) accelerated the onset of puberty, it (20 and 200 µg/kg/day) disrupted estrous cyclicity, it (20 µg and 500 mg/kg/day) increased litter size, and it (500 mg/kg/day) decreased fertility-related indices. In the F3 generation, ancestral DEHP exposure (20, 200 µg, and 500 mg/kg/day) accelerated the onset of puberty, it (20 µg/kg/day) disrupted estrous cyclicity, and it (750 mg/kg/day) decreased female pup anogenital index.

Previous studies demonstrated that developmental exposure to the weakly estrogenic PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221) in Sprague-Dawley rats altered sexual development, adult reproductive physiology and body weight. The current study tested the hypothesis that prenatal A1221 exposure not only disrupts these endpoints within an exposed individual's (F1 generation) lifespan, but may also affect subsequent generations (F2-F3). We treated pregnant female rats on embryonic days (E) 16 and E18 with A1221 (1 mg/kg), estradiol benzoate (50 μg/kg, positive estrogenic control), or vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil, negative control). Endpoints related to sexually dimorphic developmental trajectories of reproductive and developmental physiology were measured, and as adults, reproductive endocrine status was assessed, in the F1, F2, and F3 generations. Significant effects of transgenerational EDCs were found for body weight and serum hormones. The A1221 descendants had significantly higher body weight in the F2-maternal lineage throughout postnatal development, and in F3-maternal lineage animals after weaning. In females, generation- and lineage-specific effects of exposure were found for serum progesterone and estradiol. Specifically, serum progesterone concentrations were lower in F2-A1221 females, and higher in F3-A1221 females, compared to their respective F2- and F3-vehicle counterparts. Serum estradiol concentrations were higher in F3-A1221 than F3-vehicle females. Reproductive and adrenal organ weights, birth outcomes, sex ratio, and estrous cycles, were unaffected. It is notable that effects of A1221 were only sometimes mirrored by the estrogenic control, EB, indicating that the mechanism of action of A1221 was likely via non-estrogenic pathways. PCBs caused body weight and hormonal effects in rats that were not observed in the directly exposed F1 offspring, but emerged in F2 and F3 generations. Furthermore, most effects were in the maternal lineage; this may relate to the timing of exposure of the F1 fetuses at E16 and 18, when germline (the future F2 generation) epigenetic changes diverge in the sexes. These results showing transgenerational effects of EDCs have implications for humans, as we are now in the 3rd generation since the Chemical Revolution of the mid-twentieth century, and even banned chemicals such as PCBs have a persistent imprint on the health of our descendants.",PMC5819226

Our study aimed to assess the relationship between in-utero exposure to phthalates, bisphenol A and other phenolic compounds (parabens, triclosan, dichlorophenols and benzophenone-3) and the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of boys at 5-6 years. In 452 mother-son dyads from the French EDEN cohort, we measured 11 phthalate metabolites and 9 phenolic compounds (4 parabens, benzophenone-3, bisphenol A, 2 dichlorophenols and triclosan) in spot urine samples collected between 22 and 29 gestational weeks. Verbal and performance IQ of children were assessed at 5-6 years by a psychologist using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). We used adjusted Structural Equation Models (SEM) combined with Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction to assess the associations between maternal urine phenol and phthalate metabolite concentrations considered simultaneously and the boys' IQ. No phenol or phthalate metabolite concentration was negatively associated with the boys' verbal or performance IQ (uncorrected p-values ≥0.09). Mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate tended to be associated with increased verbal IQ (β = 0.136, 95% confidence interval, 0.01; 0.27). This association disappeared after correction for multiple comparison (corrected p-value, 0.71). Our results did not provide evidence of an inverse association between in-utero exposure to phenols or phthalates and verbal and performance IQ among boys. Since phenols and phthalates may have sex-specific effects, these null findings cannot be generalized to girls.

Toward this end, lymphoid tissues from a total of 641 rats were assayed after being continuously dosed with BPA or controls for up to one year. To comprehensively evaluate the effects of BPA on leukocyte compositions, extensive endpoints that cover major populations of leukocytes were assessed, including B cells, T cells, NK cells, granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. In total, of the 530 measurements in BPA-treated rats, 10 measurements were statistically different from vehicle controls and were mainly associated with either the macrophage or dendritic cell populations. Most, if not all, of these alterations were found to be transient with no persistent trend over the one-year time period.

We analyzed 5 chemical classes of non-persistent EDCs in seminal plasma for 339 male partners of couples who were recruited prior to conception and who were followed daily until pregnant or after one year of trying. Benzophenones, bisphenols, parabens, and phthalate metabolites and phthalate diesters were measured using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) except for phthalate diesters, which were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cox regression with discrete-time was used to estimate fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each chemical to estimate the probability of pregnancy. While most EDCs were detected in seminal plasma, concentrations were lower than urinary concentrations previously analyzed for the cohort. None of the EDCs were significantly associated with fecundability even after covariate adjustment, though benzophenones consistently yielded FORs <1.0 (ranging from 0.72 to 0.91) in couple-adjusted models suggestive of diminished fecundity (longer TTP).

However, the potential biological actions, toxicity, and the molecular mechanism of these compounds are still poorly understood. Our objective was to examine the estrogenic effects of BPA, BPAF, and BPS and the molecular mechanisms of action in the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) complex. In vitro cell models were used to compare the estrogenic effects of BPA, BPAF, and BPS to estrogen. Microarray Assay for Real-Time Coregulator-Nuclear receptor Interaction (MARCoNI) analysis was used to identify coregulators of BPA, BPAF, and BPS, and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were used to determine the compounds binding in the ERα complex. We demonstrated that BPA and BPAF have agonistic activity for both ERα and ERβ, but BPS has ERα-selective specificity.

Here, we have investigated the effect of BPA in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells and in human non-transformed epithelial prostate EPN cells. Our data showed that BPA induces the down regulation of cyclin D1 expression and the upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27, leading to cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, we found that the BPA anti-proliferative response depends on a strong and rapid activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which stimulates ERK-dependent pathway. This, in turn, induces expression of p53 and its phosphorylation on residue Ser15, which is responsible for cell cycle arrest. EGFR activation occurs upon a cross talk with androgen (AR) and estradiol receptor-β (ERβ) which are known to bind BPA. Altogether, these findings show a novel signaling pathway in which EGFR activation plays a key role on BPA-induced cell cycle inhibition through a pathway involving AR and ERβ/EGFR complexes, ERK and p53.

Of the 49 toys analyzed, 65% contained at least one phthalate at a concentration of >0.1% by mass; and 35% contained multiple-phthalates at individual concentrations of >0.1%. A HI of 3.4 was derived for the combined exposures to the four phthalates associated with reproductive and developmental effects. A HI of 0.3 was derived for the group of phthalates associated with hepatotoxic effects. Five phthalates were detected at levels exceeding the EU regulatory limit of 0.1% by mass. Risk assessment calculations indicate that, using realistic exposure scenarios, the worst-case combined exposure to phthalates associated with developmental toxicity exceeded a HI of 1 so may cause adverse developmental effects.",PMC5858269

BPA is used in various food-contacting materials and is easily eluted into food; as a result, we are exposed to BPA on a daily basis. In adults, BPA is metabolized and eliminated rapidly from the body. However, numerous reports suggest that fetuses and young children are susceptible to BPA. One of the concerning adverse effects of BPA is disruption of behavior, especially anxiety-like behavior. In order to study the mechanism of influences on offspring, it is important to clarify the most vulnerable gestation period. We hypothesized that offspring in late pregnancy would be more susceptible to BPA, because late pregnancy is a critical time for functional brain development. In this study, C57BL/6 mouse fetuses were exposed prenatally by oral dosing of pregnant dams, once daily from gestational day 5.5 to 12.5 (early pregnancy) or 11.5 to 18.5 (late pregnancy), with BPA (0 or 10 mg/kg body weight). Following birth and weaning, the resulting pups were tested using an elevated plus maze at postnatal week 10. The behavior of the offspring was altered by prenatal BPA exposure during late pregnancy but not during early pregnancy. These results indicated that offspring are more vulnerable to exposure to BPA in late pregnancy.",PMC5880839

As estrogens are involved in the control of important reproduction-related processes, including sexual differentiation and maturation, aromatase is a potential target for endocrine disrupting chemicals as well as breast cancer therapy. In this work, 3D-QSAR combined with quantitative profile of protein-ligand interactions was employed in the identification and characterization of critical steric and electronic features of aromatase-inhibitor complexes and the estimation of their quantitative contribution to inhibition potency. Bioactivity data on pIC50 values of 175 steroidal and 124 azaheterocyclic human aromatase inhibitors (AIs) were used for the 3D-QSAR analysis. For the quantitative description of the effects of the hydrophobic contact and nitrogen-heme-iron coordination on aromatase inhibition, the hydrophobicity density field model and the smallest dual descriptor Δf(r) S were introduced, respectively. The model revealed that hydrophobic contact and nitrogen-heme-iron coordination primarily determines inhibition potency of steroidal and azaheterocyclic AIs, respectively. Moreover, hydrogen bonds with key amino acid residues, in particular Asp309 and Met375, and interaction with the heme-iron are required for potent inhibition. Phe221 and Thr310 appear to be quite flexible and adopt different conformations according to a substituent at 4- or 6-position of steroids. Flexible docking results indicate that proper representation of the residues' flexibility is critical for reasonable description of binding of the structurally diverse inhibitors. Our results provide a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of inhibitory activity of steroidal and azaheterocyclic AIs of relevance to adverse outcome pathway development and rational drug design.",PMC5773458

BPS is increasingly used in plastics and thermal receipts as a substitute for bisphenol A, which has been phased out due to concerns about human health implications. The ability of BPS to alter female reproductive function in mammals has not been widely studied, despite the importance of normal hormone signalling for female reproduction. The aim of this study was to investigate how BPS (in a wide range of doses, including very low doses) affects granulosa cell and theca cell steroid hormone production and cell viability in the bovine. Granulosa cell oestradiol production was stimulated when cells were exposed to 100 μM BPS under basal conditions, but there was no effect of BPS when cells were stimulated with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Additionally, there was no effect of BPS on granulosa cell progesterone production or cell viability under basal or FSH-stimulated conditions. BPS did not affect theca cell androstenedione or progesterone production, or theca cell viability under basal or luteinizing hormone-stimulated conditions. This study suggests for the first time that BPS may alter oestradiol production by bovine granulosa cells, albeit at a concentration that is unlikely to be physiologically relevant. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of BPS on the bovine oocyte and on other functions of follicular cells.",PMC5847463

A feature of the tested chemicals was that they induced Cyp2b10 in vivo implicating activation of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Recent studies suggest that these compounds could be indirect CAR activators via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition. Assays included a CAR activity reporter assay, EGF endocytosis assay, and EGFR phosphorylation assay. Docking simulations were used to identify putative binding sites for environmental chemicals on the EGFR. Whole-weight and lipid-adjusted serum mean pollutant exposures were determined using data from the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES) and compared with the IC50 values determined in vitro. Chlordane, trans-nonachlor, PCB-126, PCB-153, and atrazine were the most potent EGFR inhibitors tested. PCB-126, PCB-153, and trans-nonachlor appeared to be competitive EGFR antagonists as they displaced bound EGF from EGFR. However, atrazine acted through a different mechanism and could be an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. EGFR inhibition relative effect potencies were determined for these compounds. In NHANES, serum concentrations of trans-nonachlor, PCB-126, and PCB-153 greatly exceeded their calculated IC50 values. A common mechanism of action through EGFR inhibition for three diverse classes of metabolic disrupting chemicals was characterized by measuring inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation and EGF-EGFR endocytosis. Based on NHANES data, EGFR inhibition may be an environmentally relevant mode of action for some PCBs, pesticides, and herbicides.",PMC5888991

However, investigation of the effects of acute exposure to these two EDCs during prepuberty has been lacking. In this study, DEHP and GEN were administrated to prepubertal male Sprague‑Dawley rats by gavage from PND22 to PND35 with vehicle control, GEN 50 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day, DEHP50, 150 and 450 mg/kg bw/day, and combined treatment. Reproductive parameters including testis weight, anogenital distance and organ coefficient were evaluated on PND36. Enzyme activity involved in the regulation of testicular redox state as well as expression of genes and proteins related to anti-oxidative ability and apoptosis were also investigated. The results revealed that by PND36, DEHP treatment had significantly decreased the testis weight, organ coefficient, testicular anti-oxidative enzyme activities and caused tubular vacuolation; however, co‑administration of GEN partially alleviated DEHP‑induced testicular injuries and enhanced testicular anti‑oxidative enzyme activities and upregulated the expression of NF‑E2 related factor 2 and heme oxygenase‑1, which indicated that GEN partially attenuated DEHP‑induced male reproductive system damage through anti‑oxidative action following acute prepubertal exposure to DEHP.

Treatment with BPA resulted in increased the expression of PCNA, DLP weight and DLP epithelial height compared with the control group (P < 0.01); such effects were more obvious at higher BPA doses. 90 µg/kg BPA significantly increased the estrogen to androgen ratio (P < 0.05). The EMT chip showed the BPA induced upregulation of vimentin, Snail, Twist1, and transforming growth factor beta 1, as well as the downregulation of E-cadherin in the DLP. Immunohistochemical data showed that the expression of vimentin, estrogen receptor subtypes, and androgen receptor increased and the expression of E-cadherin decreased in 30 and 90 µg/kg BPA groups.

Girls who reported using makeup every day vs. rarely/never had higher urinary concentrations of monoethyl phthalate (MEP) (102.2 ng/mL vs. 52.4 ng/mL, P-value: 0.04), methyl paraben (MP) (120.5 ng/mL vs. 13.4 ng/mL, P-value < 0.01), and propyl paraben (PP) (60.4 ng/mL vs. 2.9 ng/mL, P-value < 0.01). Girls who reported recent use of specific makeup products, including foundation, blush, and mascara, had higher urinary concentrations of MEP, mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), MP, and PP. Use of Colgate Total toothpaste was associated with 86.7% higher urinary triclosan concentrations. Use of sunscreen was associated with 57.8% higher urinary concentrations of BP-3.

We exposed subjects to varying concentrations of RE, and one-tenth the LC50 concentration (2.37 ppm) was established as the sublethal dose. After 2 weeks exposure, reproductive behaviour, cumulative number of eggs laid, percentage of fertilized eggs, and whole body steroid and thyroid hormones were measured. Reproductive association behaviour did not differ between control and RE-exposed animals, but spawning attempts were reduced in RE exposed animals. Cumulative egg production between days 9 to 14, RE exposed fish laid 672 eggs while control fish laid 1242 eggs. Also, percentage of fertilized eggs was higher for the control than for the RE exposed fish. Estradiol-17β (E2) levels were reduced in females exposed to RE and testosterone (T) was statistically lower in both males and females treated with RE. Furthermore, thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) declined in fish treated with RE. RE has endocrine disrupting potential in fish, which has important implications for studying the effects of unintentional pharmaceutical exposure. Moreover, the results demonstrate that drug exposure may affect more than just the overall level of behaviour, emphasizing the relevance of examining the effects of individual exposure. We reinforce the use of zebrafish as a model organism in physiology and behaviour, and raise concerns about the toxic effects of RE in non-target organisms such as aquatic vertebrates, which may ultimately affect human health.",PMC6130722

PCDD/Fs are toxic and are associated with numerous adverse health outcomes including cancer, diabetes, and impaired reproductive and immunologic function. Prior studies have found adults exposed to the WTC disaster to have elevated levels of PCDD/Fs. This is the first study to assess PCDD/F levels in WTC-exposed children. This analysis includes 110 participants, a subset of the 2014-2016 WTC Adolescent Health Study, a group of both exposed youths who lived, attended school, or were present in lower Manhattan on 9/11 recruited from the WTC Health Registry (WTCHR) and unexposed youths frequency matched on age, sex, race, ethnicity, and income. Our sample was selected to maximize the contrast in their exposure to dust from the WTC collapse. Questionnaire data, including items about chronic home dust and acute dust cloud exposure, anthropometric measures, and biologic specimens were collected during a clinic visit. Serum PCDD/F concentrations were measured according to a standardized procedure at the New York State Department of Health Organic Analytical Laboratory. We used multivariable linear regression to assess differences in PCCD/Fs between WTCHR and non-WTCHR participants. We also compared mean and median PCDD/F and toxic equivalency (TEQ) concentrations in our cohort to 2003-4 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) levels for youths age 12-19. Median PCDD/F levels were statistically significantly higher among WTCHR participants compared to non-WTCHR participants for 16 out of 17 congeners. Mean and median TEQ concentrations in WTCHR participants were >7 times those in non-WTCHR participants (72.5 vs. 10.1 and 25. 3 vs. 3.39pg/g lipid, respectively). Among WTCHR participants, median concentrations of several PCDD/Fs were higher than the NHANES 95th percentiles.

Adolescents in lower Manhattan on the day of the WTC attack and exposed to particulate contamination from the WTC collapse had significantly elevated PCDD/F levels >12years later compared to a matched comparison group, driven by chronic home dust exposure rather than acute dust cloud exposure.

Furthermore, the livers of these models were then examined for irregularities and double-labeled immunofluorescence was used to check the innervated hepatic samples for varying neuronal expression of selected neuronal markers in the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS). It was found that both the PSNS and all of the neuronal markers showed increased expression, with some of them being significant even at recommended safe exposure levels. The implications are quite serious since these effects have been observed at recommended safe levels with expression increasing in-line with exposure levels.

Pregnant CD-1 mice were orally dosed with corn oil (vehicle control) or DEHP (20 and 200 µg/kg/d and 500 and 750 mg/kg/d) from gestational day 11 until birth. The F1 females were mated with untreated males to create the F2 generation, and the F2 females were mated with untreated males to create the F3 generation. At 1 year, ovaries, hormones, and estrous cycles were analyzed in each generation. Prenatal DEHP exposure altered estrous cyclicity (750 mg/kg/d), increased the presence of ovarian cysts (750 mg/kg/d), and decreased total follicle numbers (750 mg/kg/d) in the F1 generation. It also decreased anogenital distance (200 µg/kg/d) and altered follicle numbers (200 µg/kg/d and 500 mg/kg/d) in the F2 generation, and it altered estrous cyclicity (20 and 200 µg/kg/d and 500 and 750 mg/kg/d) and decreased folliculogenesis (200 µg/kg/d and 500 mg/kg/d) in the F3 generation.

Pregnant CD-1 mice (F0) were dosed daily with 0, 5, or 500 μg/kg/d BPA during gestational days 9 to 18, and the weaned F1 animals were fed ad libitum with standard chow until they were euthanized at 19 weeks old. In the vehicle-exposed F1 animals, fggy promoter showed a clear bimodal pattern of very strong (55% to 95%) or very weak (5% to 30%) DNA methylation occurring at nearly equal incidence with no intermediate strength. Promoter hypermethylation completely suppressed mRNA expression. BPA exposure eliminated this naturally occurring dichotomy, shifting fggy promoter toward the hypomethylation state to release transcriptional suppression. The strength of Fggy mRNA expression significantly correlated with increased whole body weight and gonadal fat weight of males but not females. Bioinformatics studies showed that expression of Fggy mRNA is stronger in mouse WATs than in brown adipose tissues and enhanced in gonadal fat by diet-induced obesity. These observations suggest that prenatal exposure to BPA may disrupt the physiological bimodal nature of epigenetic regulation of fggy in mouse WATs, possibly contributing to the adult-onset obesity phenotype.",PMC5774244

We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine the two imprinted genes in our data set, Meg3 and microRNA-containing gene Mirg (residing in the same loci). Confirming the RNA-seq, Meg3 messenger RNA was higher in F3 brains from the BPA lineage than in control brains. This was true in brains from mice produced with two different BPA paradigms. Next, we used pyrosequencing to probe differentially methylated regions of Meg3. We found transgenerational effects of BPA on imprinted genes in brain. Given these results, and data on Meg3 methylation in humans, we suggest this gene may be a biomarker indicative of early life environmental perturbation.",PMC5761590

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We recently demonstrated that perinatal BPA exposure is associated with higher body fat, impaired glucose tolerance, and reduced insulin secretion in first- (F1) and second-generation (F2) C57BL/6J male mice offspring. We sought to determine the multigenerational effects of maternal bisphenol A exposure on mouse pancreatic islets. Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these persistent changes were determined in F1 and F2 adult offspring of F0 mothers exposed to two relevant human exposure levels of BPA (10μg/kg/d-LowerB and 10mg/kg/d-UpperB). Both doses of BPA significantly impaired insulin secretion in male but not female F1 and F2 offspring. Surprisingly, LowerB and UpperB induced islet inflammation in male F1 offspring that persisted into the next generation. We also observed dose-specific effects of BPA on islets in males. UpperB exposure impaired mitochondrial function, whereas LowerB exposure significantly reduced β-cell mass and increased β-cell death that persisted in the F2 generation. Transcriptome analyses supported these physiologic findings and there were significant dose-specific changes in the expression of genes regulating inflammation and mitochondrial function. Previously we observed increased expression of the critically important β-cell gene, Igf2 in whole F1 embryos. Surprisingly, increased Igf2 expression persisted in the islets of male F1 and F2 offspring and was associated with altered DNA methylation. These findings demonstrate that maternal BPA exposure has dose- and sex-specific effects on pancreatic islets of adult F1 and F2 mice offspring. The transmission of these changes across multiple generations may involve either mitochondrial dysfunction and/or epigenetic modifications. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1674.",PMC5915189

Several phthalates are known antiandrogenic endocrine disruptors, which raises concern for prenatal exposure during critical windows of fetal development. While phthalate exposure is ubiquitous, certain demographics are subject to greater or lesser exposure. We sampled urine from 378 pregnant women during the second trimester of gestation living in Charleston, SC, and measured eight urinary phthalate metabolites as biomarkers of phthalate exposure: monobutyl phthalate (MBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and monomethyl phthalate (MMP). Demographic data was collected from questionnaires administered at the time of specimen collection. All phthalate metabolites were detected in over 93% of urine samples. On average, concentrations were highest for MEP (median = 47.0 ng/mL) and lowest for MMP (median = 1.92 ng/mL). Sociodemographic characteristics associated with elevated phthalate concentrations included being unmarried, less educated, having a low income, high body mass index (BMI), and/or being African American. After racial stratification, age, BMI, education, and income were significantly associated with phthalate concentrations in African American women.

In this study, we establish a noninvasive and label-free optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based imaging platform for tracking exposure-response relationships in 3D human mammary epithelial organoid models. The OCT-based assay includes metrics that quantify organoid intracellular kinetic energy and cross-sectional area (CSA). We compare the results to those obtained using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) mitochondrial dye conversion assay. Both estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (MCF7) and ER-negative (MCF10DCIS.com) breast cell lines were studied, beginning one hour after exposure and continuing for several days. Six days of exposure to 17β-estradiol or the selective ER modulator 4-hydroxytamoxifen respectively increased or decreased MCF7 organoid CSA (p < .01), consistent with the role of estrogen signaling in ER-positive mammary epithelial cell proliferation.

The murine pituitary gland has two critical windows of development: embryonic gland establishment and neonatal hormone cell expansion. During embryonic development, one environmentally ubiquitous endocrine-disrupting chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), has been shown to alter pituitary development by increasing proliferation and gonadotrope number in females but not males. However, the effects of exposure during the neonatal period have not been examined. Therefore, we dosed pups from postnatal day (PND)0 to PND7 with 0.05, 0.5, and 50 μg/kg/d BPA, environmentally relevant doses, or 50 μg/kg/d estradiol (E2). Mice were collected after dosing at PND7 and at 5 weeks. Dosing mice neonatally with BPA caused sex-specific gene expression changes distinct from those observed with embryonic exposure. At PND7, pituitary Pit1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was decreased with BPA 0.05 and 0.5 μg/kg/d in males only. Expression of Pomc mRNA was decreased at 0.5 μg/kg/d BPA in males and at 0.5 and 50 μg/kg/d BPA in females. Similarly, E2 decreased Pomc mRNA in both males and females. However, no noticeable corresponding changes were found in protein expression. Both E2 and BPA suppressed Pomc mRNA in pituitary organ cultures; this repression appeared to be mediated by estrogen receptor-α and estrogen receptor-β in females and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor in males, as determined by estrogen receptor subtype-selective agonists. These data demonstrated that BPA exposure during neonatal pituitary development has unique sex-specific effects on gene expression and that Pomc repression in males and females can occur through different mechanisms.",PMC5761589

Fifty-five women with a history of 3-7 years of infertility, with at least two assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment failures, and low serum levels of AMH were enrolled in the study. Before starting any further ART treatment, they were tested for AMH and for follicular count. A urinary control of BPA was proposed. Then a support of the 1-CC, already tested in other clinical studies, was initiated and continued for 4 months. At the end of this period, antral follicle count and serum AMH levels were re-evaluated. The AMH levels before and after treatment were compared using the Wilcoxon test (nonparametric test, non-Gaussian population). Out of the 55 patients, 35 accepted a BPA dosage in the urine. No correlation was found between BPA and serum AMH concentrations. Forty-nine patients followed the full treatment with 1-CC supplements, which resulted in increased AMH levels, independent of initial AMH levels and maternal age (in the range studied), p = 0.0001. Eight patients spontaneously conceived ongoing pregnancies within 3 months, at the end of the protocol.

Seventeen urinary phthalate and 1,2-Cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid diisononyl ester (DINCH) metabolite concentrations were measured from spot urine samples. The A-clust algorithm was employed to identify co-regulated regions. DMRs associated with urinary metabolite concentrations were identified via linear models, corrected for false discovery rate (FDR). Adjusting for age, BMI, and current smoking, 131 DMRs were associated with at least one urinary metabolite. Most sperm DMRs were associated with anti-androgenic metabolites, including mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, n = 83), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP, n = 16), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP, n = 22) and cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-monocarboxy isooctyl (MCOCH, n = 7).

However, the amount of EDC uptake into the animal is often difficult to determine. Using radiolabeled estradiol ([3H]E2), we previously developed a rapid, straightforward assay to measure estradiol uptake from water into zebrafish embryos and larvae. Here, we extend this approach to measure the uptake of two additional EDCs, bisphenol A (BPA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE2). As with E2, the uptake of each compound by individual larvae was low (<6%), and increased with increasing concentration, duration, and developmental stage. We found that E2 and EE2 had similar uptake under equivalent exposure conditions, while BPA had comparatively lower uptake. One application of this assay is to test factors that influence EDC uptake or efflux. It has been suggested that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) inhibit ABC transporters that may normally efflux EDCs and their metabolites, inducing toxicity in aquatic organisms. We measured [3H]E2 levels in zebrafish in the presence or absence of the POP PDBE-100, and cyclosporine A, a known inhibitor of ABC transporters. Neither chemical significantly affected [3H]E2 levels in zebrafish, suggesting that zebrafish maintain estradiol efflux in the presence of PDBE-100, independently of cyclosporine A-responsive transporters. These uptake results will be a valuable reference for EDC exposure studies in developing zebrafish, and provide a rapid assay to screen for chemicals that influence estrogen-like EDC levels in vivo.",PMC5862746

No data on large study populations are available for other phenols with possible endocrine-disrupting properties. We aimed to study associations between prenatal exposure to phthalates and several phenols on behavior among male infants. We quantified 11 phthalate metabolites and nine phenols (four parabens, benzophenone-3, BPA, two dichlorophenols, triclosan) in spot urine samples collected during pregnancy among EDEN cohort mothers who delivered a boy. Mothers completed the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) when their children were 3.1 (n=529) and 5.6 (n=464) y old. BPA was positively associated with the relationship problems subscale at 3 y [incidence rate ratio (IRR): 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.20] and the hyperactivity-inattention subscale scores at 5 y (IRR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.14). Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was positively associated with internalizing behavior, relationship problem, and emotional symptom scores at 3 y. Monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was positively associated with internalizing behavior and relationship problems scores at 3 y. After dichotomizing SDQ scores, triclosan tended to be positively associated with emotional symptom subscales at both 3 and 5 y. The observed associations between BPA, MnBP, and behavior in boys are consistent with previous findings. Further health impact assessment studies based on dose-response functions corrected for exposure misclassification are required to quantify the public health burden possibly entailed by such associations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1314.",PMC5915182

However, the effects of exposure to a ubiquitous contaminant di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) on these behaviors and, in particular, on courtship vocalizations have not been examined. The effects of adult exposure to DEHP on courtship and mating behaviors and gonadotropic axis and neural mechanisms involved in DEHP-induced effects were analyzed in male mice. Adult C57BL/6J males were orally exposed to DEHP (0, 0.5, 5, and 50μg/kg/d) for 4 wk. Olfactory preference, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), partner preference and mating, as well as locomotor activity and motor coordination, were measured. The kisspeptin system and testosterone levels were analyzed. Proteomic and molecular studies were conducted on the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus, the key region involved in sexual motivation to vocalize and mate. DEHP at 50μg/kg/d reduced the emission of USVs, whereas lower doses changed the ratio of syllable categories. This was associated with diminished sexual interest of female partners toward males exposed to 5 or 50μg/kg/d and increased latency to mate, despite normal olfactory preference. The kisspeptin system and circulating testosterone levels were unaffected. In DEHP-exposed males, proteomic analysis of the preoptic nucleus identified differentially expressed proteins connected to the androgen receptor (AR). Indeed, exposure to 5 or 50μg/kg/d of DEHP induced selective AR downregulation in this nucleus and upstream chemosensory regions. The involvement of AR changes in the observed alterations was further supported by the reduced emission of courtship vocalizations in males with disrupted neural AR expression. These data demonstrate the critical role of neural AR in courtship vocalizations and raises the possibility that the vulnerability of this signaling pathway to exposure to endocrine disrupters may be detrimental for courtship communication and mating in several species. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1443.",PMC5915199

Phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are endocrine disruptors, and previous research has suggested that these chemical agents may disrupt circulating levels of total 25(OH)D in adults. We investigated the relationships between repeated measures of urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA and circulating total 25(OH)D in a prospective cohort of pregnant women. The present study population includes participants (n=477) in a nested case-control study of preterm birth drawn from a prospective birth cohort of pregnant women at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. Urine and blood samples were collected for biomarker measurements at median 10 wk and 26 wk of gestation. In repeated measures analysis, we observed that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in urinary mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) was associated with a 4.48% decrease [95% confidence interval (CI): -7.37, -1.58] in total 25(OH)D. We also detected inverse associations for metabolites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) [percent difference (%Δ)=-2.83 to -2.16]. For BPA, we observed a nonsignificant inverse association with total 25(OH)D in the overall population. Our sensitivity analysis revealed that the associations for some metabolites (e.g., MEHP) varied by race/ethnicity, which may reflect potential differences in susceptibility. In agreement with findings from repeated measures analysis, we reported that DEHP metabolites and BPA were significantly associated with an approximate 20% increase in the odds of vitamin D deficiency (≤20 ng/mL) [odds ratio (95% CI): 1.19 (1.06, 1.35) for molar sum of DEHP metabolites and 1.22 (1.01, 1.47) for BPA] at median 10 wk and 26 wk, respectively.

28929027,Milos Pjanic,The role of polycarbonate monomer bisphenol-A in insulin resistance.,2017,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a synthetic unit of polycarbonate polymers and epoxy resins, the types of plastics that could be found in essentially every human population and incorporated into almost every aspect of the modern human society. BPA polymers appear in a wide range of products, from liquid storages (plastic bottles, can and glass linings, water pipes and tanks) and food storages (plastics wraps and containers), to medical and dental devices. BPA polymers could be hydrolyzed spontaneously or in a photo- or temperature-catalyzed process, providing widespread environmental distribution and chronic exposure to the BPA monomer in contemporary human populations. Bisphenol A is also a xenoestrogen, an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that interferes with the endocrine system mimicking the effects of an estrogen and could potentially keep our endocrine system in a constant perturbation that parallels endocrine disruption arising during pregnancy, such as insulin resistance (IR). Gestational insulin resistance represents a natural biological phenomenon of higher insulin resistance in peripheral tissues of the pregnant females, when nutrients are increasingly being directed to the embryo instead of being stored in peripheral tissues. Gestational diabetes mellitus may appear in healthy non-diabetic females, due to gestational insulin resistance that leads to increased blood sugar levels and hyperinsulinemia (increased insulin production from the pancreatic beta cells). The hypothesis states that unnoticed and constant exposure to this environmental chemical might potentially lead to the formation of chronic low-level endocrine disruptive state that resembles gestational insulin resistance, which might contribute to the development of diabetes. The increasing body of evidence supports the major premises of this hypothesis, as exemplified by the numerous publications examining the association of BPA and insulin resistance, both epidemiological and mechanistic. However, to what extent BPA might contribute to the development of diabetes in the modern societies still remains unknown. In this review, I discuss the chemical properties of BPA and the sources of BPA contamination found in the environment and in human tissues. I provide an overview of mechanisms for the proposed role of bisphenol A in insulin resistance and diabetes, as well as other related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases. I describe the transmission of BPA effects to the offspring and postulate that gender related differences might originate from differences in liver enzyme levels, such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is involved in BPA processing and its elimination from the organism. I discuss the molecular mechanisms of BPA action through nuclear and membrane-bound ER receptors, non-monotonic dose response, epigenetic modifications of the DNA and propose that chronic exposure to weak binders, such as BPA, may mimic the effects of strong binders, such as estrogens.",PMC5600722

Recent evidence suggests that parabens exert estrogenic effects. This work investigated the potential interference of parabens with the estrogen-activating enzyme 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) 1 and the estrogen-inactivating 17β-HSD2. A ligand-based 17β-HSD2 pharmacophore model was applied to screen a cosmetic chemicals database, followed by in vitro testing of selected paraben compounds for inhibition of 17β-HSD1 and 17β-HSD2 activities. All tested parabens and paraben-like compounds, except their common metabolite p-hydroxybenzoic acid, inhibited 17β-HSD2. Ethylparaben and ethyl vanillate inhibited 17β-HSD2 with IC50 values of 4.6 ± 0.8 and 1.3 ± 0.3 µM, respectively. Additionally, parabens size-dependently inhibited 17β-HSD1, whereby hexyl- and heptylparaben were most active with IC50 values of 2.6 ± 0.6 and 1.8 ± 0.3 µM. Low micromolar concentrations of hexyl- and heptylparaben decreased 17β-HSD1 activity, and ethylparaben and ethyl vanillate decreased 17β-HSD2 activity. However, regarding the very rapid metabolism of these compounds to the inactive p-hydroxybenzoic acid by esterases, it needs to be determined under which conditions low micromolar concentrations of these parabens or their mixtures can occur in target cells to effectively disturb estrogen effects in vivo.",PMC5618656

Human exposure is nearly ubiquitous, and higher in children than adults. Because BPA has been reported to interfere with sex steroid hormone signaling, there is concern that developmental exposure, even at levels below the current FDA No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 5mg/kg body weight (bw)/day, can disrupt brain sexual differentiation. The current studies were conducted as part of the CLARITY-BPA (Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity) program and tested the hypothesis that perinatal BPA exposure would induce morphological changes in hormone sensitive, sexually dimorphic brain regions. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups: BPA (2.5, 25, or 2500μg/kgbw/day), a reference estrogen (0.5μg ethinylestradiol (EE2)/kgbw/day), or vehicle. Exposure occurred by gavage to the dam from gestational day 6 until parturition, and then to the offspring from birth through weaning. Unbiased stereology was used to quantify the volume of the sexually dimorphic nucleus (SDN), the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), the posterodorsal portion of the medial amygdala (MePD), and the locus coeruleus (LC) at postnatal day 28. No appreciable effects of BPA were observed on the volume of the SDN or LC. However, AVPV volume was enlarged in both sexes, even at levels below the FDA NOAEL.

Tumour leukocytic infiltrate analysis revealed a higher proportion of regulatory T lymphocytes in the BPA-exposed group. RT-PCR analysis of tumour samples showed a decreased expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ, as well as the M2 macrophage marker Fizz-1 in the BPA-exposed group.

However, use of products during medical procedures such as aqueous gel applied during obstetrical ultrasound in pregnancy has not been investigated as a potential source of endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure. Human studies have associated EDCs with various adverse pregnancy outcomes. There is a need to identify sources of inadvertent exposure to EDCs especially during vulnerable developmental periods such as pregnancy. We conducted a pilot study to determine whether use of gel during routine obstetrical ultrasound increased urinary concentrations of phthalate and phenol biomarkers. We recruited 13 women from the Massachusetts General Hospital who provided spot urine samples at the time of their second trimester anatomic survey. The first sample was collected prior to the procedure (pre-exposure, time 1), and two additional samples were obtained at approximately 1-2h (time 2) and 7-12h (time 3) post-exposure following the scan. Urinary concentrations of several DEHP metabolites and metabolite of diisononyl cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH) increased across time. For example, the geometric mean concentrations of mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate increased from 3.1ng/ml to 7.1ng/ml (p-value=0.03) between time 1 and time 3. We also observed significant differences in concentrations of metabolites of butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP). For example, mono-n-butyl phthalate (metabolite of DnBP) decreased from 3.5ng/ml to 1.8ng/ml (p-value=0.04) between time 1 and time 2, but then increased to 6.6ng/ml (p-value=0.002) at time 3.

As early pubertal onset is associated with increased risky behavior and psychological issues during adolescence and cardiometabolic disease and cancer in adulthood, this is an important public health concern. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals during critical windows of in utero development may play a role in this trend. Our objective was to investigate trimester-specific phthalate and BPA exposure in relation to pubertal development among girls in the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohort. We measured maternal urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA in samples collected during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. To assess reproductive development among their female children, we measured serum testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), inhibin B, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and assessed sexual maturation, including Tanner staging for breast and pubic hair development and menarche status, at age 8-13 years (n = 120). We used linear and logistic regression to examine measures of trimester-specific in utero exposure as predictors of peripubertal hormone levels and pubertal onset, respectively. In secondary analyses, we evaluated estimated exposure at the midpoint of the first trimester and rates of change in exposure across pregnancy in relation to outcomes. Several phthalate metabolites measured throughout in utero development were associated with higher serum testosterone concentrations, while a number of metabolites measured in the third trimester were associated with higher DHEA-S. For example, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in mean monoethyl phthalate (MEP) levels across pregnancy was associated with 44% higher peripubertal testosterone (95% CI: 13-83%), while an IQR increase in di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (ΣDEHP) specifically in the third trimester was associated with 25% higher DHEA-S (95%CI: 4.7-47%). In IQR increase in mean mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) levels across pregnancy was associated with lower odds of having a Tanner Stage >1 for breast development (OR = 0.32, 95%CI: 0.11-0.95), while MEHP in the third trimester was associated with higher odds of having a Tanner Stage >1 for pubic hair development (OR = 3.76, 95%CI: 1.1-12.8). Results from secondary analyses were consistent with findings from our main analysis. These findings suggest that female reproductive development may be more vulnerable to the effects of phthalate or BPA exposure during specific critical periods of in utero development.

At age 8years, we administered the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2 (BASC-2), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in composite scores from each instrument using a multiple informant model designed to identify heightened windows of vulnerability. Among all children, there was not strong evidence that the associations between BPA and neurobehavior varied by the timing of exposure (Visit x BPA p-values≥0.16). However, child sex modified the associations of repeated BPA measures with BASC-2 scores (Visit x Sex x BPA p-values=0.02-0.23).

Distinct protein secretion patterns of the cancer cell line after exposure to known estrogen receptor agonists ß-estradiol, bisphenol A, genistein, and nonylphenol as well as antagonists fulvestrant and tamoxifen demonstrate the potential of the chip. Stimulation of cells with Interleukin-1ß shifts concentrations of low abundant biomarkers towards the working range of the chip.

The set of coregulator peptides that are recruited by BPA-bound AR, either positively/or negatively, are different from those recruited by the agonist R1881-bound AR. Therefore, the data indicates that BPA shows no similarities to R1881 and suggests that it may recruit other coregulators to the AR complex. BPAF-bound AR recruits about 70-80% of the same coregulator peptides as BPA-bound AR. Meanwhile, BPS-bound AR interacts with only few peptides compared to BPA or BPAF-bound AR. MD results show that multiple binding sites with varying binding affinities are available on AR for BPA, BPAF, and BPS, indicating the availability of modified binding surfaces on AR for coregulator interactions.

HuF cells were isolated and cultured for eight days in the presence of a decidualization-inducing cocktail, while concurrently exposed to physiological and supra-physiologic doses of BPA (1ng/mL, 10ng/mL, 0.5μg/mL, 10μg/mL and 20μg/mL). Decidualization markers, steroid hormone receptors and cell cycle gene expression were detected by qRT-PCR and cellular proliferation was assessed by KI-67 immunofluorescent staining and MTS assay. BPA impaired decidualization at 10μg/mL and 20μg/mL, but not at lower doses. Additionally, BPA at 20μg/mL decreased progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor-alpha compared to controls. The highest dose of BPA also reduced cellular proliferation and cyclin D2 expression compared to controls.

Exposure during early gestation, a critical period for reproductive development, is of particular concern. Anogenital distance (AGD) is a sensitive biomarker of the fetal hormonal milieu and a measure of reproductive toxicity in animal models. In some studies, the daughters of BPA-exposed dams have shorter AGD than controls. Here, we investigate this relationship in humans. BPA was assayed in first-trimester urine samples from 385 participants who delivered infant girls in a multicenter pregnancy cohort study. After birth, daughters underwent exams that included two measures of AGD (AGD-AC: distance from center of anus to clitoris; AGD-AF: distance from center of anus to fourchette). We fit linear regression models to examine the association between specific gravity-adjusted (SPG-adj) maternal BPA concentrations and infant AGD, adjusting for covariates. BPA was detectable in 94% of women. In covariate-adjusted models fit on 381 eligible subjects, the natural logarithm of SpG-adj maternal BPA concentration was inversely associated with infant AGD-AC [β=−0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.97, −0.15]. We observed no association between maternal BPA and infant AGD-AF. BPA may have toxic effects on the female reproductive system in humans, as it does in animal models. Higher first-trimester BPA exposure was associated with significantly shorter AGD in daughters, suggesting that BPA may alter the hormonal environment of the female fetus. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP875.",PMC5744699

Previous studies have suggested a role of these compounds in the shedding of signaling molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of BPA and NP on the sheddase ADAM17 and its newly discovered regulators iRhom1 and iRhom2 in the release of EGFR-ligands. We report that BPA and NP can stimulate the release of the ADAM17-substrates HB-EGF and TGF-α. In cells lacking ADAM17 (Adam17-/- mEFs) BPA-stimulated release of HB-EGF, but not TGF-α, was strongly reduced, whereas NP-stimulated shedding of HB-EGF and TGF-α was completely abolished. Inactivation of both ADAM17 and the related ADAM10 (Adam10/17-/- mEFs) completely prevented the release of these substrates. In the absence of iRhom1, BPA- or NP-stimulated release of HB-EGF or TGF-α was comparable to wild-type control mEFs, conversely the BPA-induced release of HB-EGF was abolished in iRhom2-/- mEFs. The defect in shedding of HB-EGF in iRhom2-/- mEF cells could be rescued by overexpressing iRhom2. Interestingly, the NP-stimulated release of HB-EGF was not affected by the absence of iRhom2, suggesting that NP could potentially activate both ADAM10 and ADAM17. We tested this hypothesis using betacellulin (BTC), an EGFR-ligand that is a substrate for ADAM10. We found that NP, but not BPA stimulated the release of BTC in Adam17-/- , iRhom2-/- , or iRhom1/2-/- , but not in Adam10/17-/- cells. Taken together, our results suggest that BPA and NP stimulate the release of EGFR-ligands by differentially activating ADAM17 or ADAM10. The identification of specific effects of these endocrine disruptors on ADAM10 and ADAM17 will help to provide a better understanding of their roles in cell signaling and proinflammatory processes, and provide new potential targets for treatment of reproductive or inflammatory diseases such as asthma or breast cancer that are promoted by xenoestrogens.",PMC5705578

However, prior studies had limited statistical power to examine sex-specific effects, and few examined child cognition. We estimated the association between prenatal BPA exposure and child neurobehavior at 3 y of age in a prospective cohort of 812 mothers and their children. We measured BPA concentration in urine samples collected at ∼12 wk gestation among women enrolled in a 10-city Canadian cohort study. At approximately 3 y of age, we assessed children’s cognitive abilities with the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of IntelligenceTM–III (WPPSI-III) and two scales of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function–Preschool (BRIEF-P). Parents reported children’s behavior using the Behavior Assessment System for Children–2 (BASC-2) and the Social Responsiveness ScaleTM–2 (SRS-2). We estimated covariate-adjusted differences in neurobehavioral outcomes with a doubling in BPA concentration and sex-specific associations. BPA was not associated with WPPSI-III scores; child sex did not modify these associations. The association between BPA and BRIEF-P scores was modified by child sex (BPA×sex p-values≤0.03). For example, a doubling of BPA concentration was associated with 1-point (95% CI: 0.3, 1.7) poorer working memory in boys and 0.5-point (95% CI: −1.1, 0.1) better scores in girls. BPA was not associated with most BASC-2 scales; however, it was associated with more internalizing and somatizing behaviors in boys, but not in girls (BPA×sex p&-values≤0.08). A doubling of BPA concentration was associated with poorer SRS-2 scores [β=0.3 ( 95% CI: 0, 0.7)]; this association was not modified by sex.

The aim was to investigate the effects of low-dose developmental BPA exposure on metabolic parameters in male and female Fischer 344 (F344) rat offspring. Pregnant F344 rats were exposed to BPA via their drinking water, corresponding to 0.5 μg/kg BW/d (BPA0.5; <em>n</em>=21) or 50 μg/kg BW/d (BPA50; <em>n</em>=16), from gestational day (GD) 3.5 until postnatal day (PND) 22, and controls were given vehicle (<em>n</em>=26). Body weight (BW), adipose tissue, liver (weight, histology, and gene expression), heart weight, and lipid profile were investigated in the 5-wk-old offspring. Males and females exhibited differential susceptibility to the different doses of BPA. Developmental BPA exposure increased plasma triglyceride levels (0.81&plusmn;0.10 mmol/L compared with 0.57&plusmn;0.03 mmol/L, females BPA50 <em>p</em>=0.04; 0.81&plusmn;0.05 mmol/L compared with 0.61&plusmn;0.04 mmol/L, males BPA0.5 <em>p</em>=0.005) in F344 rat offspring compared with controls.

Evidence suggests that phthalate and BPA exposure alters steroid hormone levels in adults, while in utero exposure has been associated with altered fetal reproductive development in boys. However, the impact of exposure during distinct critical windows of in utero development on hormone concentrations and sexual maturation during the pubertal transition has not been examined. The objective of this study was to assess trimester-specific in utero phthalate and BPA exposure in relation to measures of reproductive development among peripubertal boys in a Mexico City birth cohort. We measured maternal urinary phthalate metabolites and BPA during the first, second, and third trimesters of pregnancy. We measured serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), inhibin B, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and assessed sexual maturation (Tanner staging and testicular volume) among male children at age 8-14 years (n = 109). Linear and logistic regression were used to investigate trimester-specific in utero exposure as predictors of peripubertal hormone levels and sexual maturation, respectively. In sensitivity analyses we evaluated estimated exposure at 7 weeks gestation and rates of change in exposure across pregnancy in relation to outcomes. Exposure to phthalates during the third trimester was associated with reduced odds of having a Tanner stage >1 for pubic hair development (e.g. MBzP OR = 0.18 per interquartile range (IQR) increase; 95% CI:0.03-0.97) and higher peripubertal SHBG levels (e.g. MBzP 15.2%/IQR; 95% CI:3.2-28%), while first and second trimester phthalates were not. In contrast, exposure to DEHP during the first trimester was associated with higher estradiol (11%/IQR; 95% CI:1.5-22%), while second or third trimester DEHP exposure was not. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings. Associations between in utero phthalate and BPA exposure and peripubertal measures of male reproductive development are dependent on the timing of that exposure during gestation.

Our objective was to comprehensively characterize bisphenols gene targets in a human primary adipocyte model, in order to determine whether they may induce cellular dysfunction, using chronic exposure at two concentrations: a ""low-dose"" similar to the dose usually encountered in human biological fluids and a higher dose. Therefore, BPA, BPF and BPS have been added at 10 nM or 10 μM during the differentiation of human primary adipocytes from subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female patients.

Enrichment in ""cancer"" and ""organismal injury and abnormalities"" related pathways was found in response to the three products. Some long intergenic non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs were differentially expressed suggesting that bisphenols may also activate multiple cellular processes and epigenetic modifications. The analysis of upstream regulators of deregulated genes highlighted hormones or hormone-like chemicals suggesting that BPS and BPF can be suspected to interfere, just like BPA, with hormonal regulation and have to be considered as endocrine disruptors.

Recent studies have shown that dermal absorption of BPA can occur when handling these papers. Yet, regulatory agencies have largely dismissed thermal paper as a major source of BPA exposure. Exposure estimates provided by agencies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are based on assumptions about how humans interact with this material, stating that 'typical' exposures for adults involve only one handling per day for short periods of time (<1 minute), with limited exposure surfaces (three fingertips). The objective of this study was to determine how individuals handle thermal paper in one common setting: a cafeteria providing short-order meals. We observed thermal paper handling in a college-aged population (n = 698 subjects) at the University of Massachusetts' dining facility. We find that in this setting, individuals handle receipts for an average of 11.5 min, that >30% of individuals hold thermal paper with more than three fingertips, and >60% allow the paper to touch their palm. Only 11% of the participants we observed were consistent with the EFSA model for time of contact and dermal surface area. Mathematical modeling based on handling times we measured and previously published transfer coefficients, concentrations of BPA in paper, and absorption factors indicate the most conservative estimated intake from handling thermal paper in this population is 51.1 ng/kg/day, similar to EFSA's estimates of 59 ng/kg/day from dermal exposures. Less conservative estimates, using published data on concentrations in thermal paper and transfer rates to skin, indicate that exposures are likely significantly higher.

Concentrations of 11 phthalate metabolites were analyzed in maternal urine samples collected at 13 and 26 weeks gestation as a measure of fetal exposure. DNA methylation was assessed using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip adjusting for cord blood cell composition. To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that may be more informative than individual CpG sites, we used two different approaches, DMRcate and comb-p. Regional assessment by both methods identified 27 distinct DMRs, the majority of which were in relation to multiple phthalate metabolites. Most of the significant DMRs (67%) were observed for later pregnancy (26 weeks gestation). Further, 51% of the significant DMRs were associated with the di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites. Five individual CpG sites were associated with phthalate metabolite concentrations after multiple comparisons adjustment (FDR), all showing hypermethylation. Genes with DMRs were involved in inflammatory response (IRAK4 and ESM1), cancer (BRCA1 and LASP1), endocrine function (CNPY1), and male fertility (IFT140, TESC, and PRDM8).

Assays of phenol derivatives were conducted using the high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection technique. In human hair, the mean BPA concentration amounted to 411.2 ng g-1 dw, OP 131.2 ng g-1 dw, NP 4478.4 ng g-1 dw, in seal fur BPA 67.5 ng g-1 dw, OP 62.8 ng g-1 dw, NP 39.1 ng g-1 dw, and in feathers BPA 145.1 ng g-1 dw, OP 162.0 ng g-1 dw, NP 37.7 ng g-1 dw. The increase of the analysed EDCs in hair was significantly influenced by diet rich in products of marine origin, as well as hair colouring, heating up food in plastic containers, using home cleaning products without protective gloves and wearing newly purchased clothes without washing them first. The concentration of phenol derivatives in seal fur was influenced solely by the uniform diet rich in fish. In birds, the feeding area during molting significantly influenced the concentration of BPA, OP and NP found in covert feathers.",PMC5422498

Pregnant rats received DBP at a dose of 850 mg/kg BW/day by oral perfusion during gestational days 14-18. In DBP exposed newborn offspring, gross observation and histopathological examination revealed the dysplasia of kidney. The expression of genes related to renal development was also changed. In DBP exposed adult offspring, histopathological examination and Masson's trichrome staining revealed the pathological changes of renal fibrosis. Furthermore, higher expression levels of transforming growth factor- β (TGF-β) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were also detected. In vitro studies reveal that DBP promoted the activation of NRK49F cells and G2/M arrest in NRK52E cells at a sublethal dose. The effect of DBP on these cell lines was linked to the generation of oxidative stress. In addition, DBP induced oxidative stress in both renal fibroblasts and tubular epithelial cells, whereas vitamin C ameliorated the changes caused by DBP. In conclusion, our results showed that prenatal exposure to DBP may generate oxidative stress in both renal fibroblasts and tubular epithelial cells, leading to kidney dysplasia and renal fibrosis.",PMC5458192

Results of that analysis indicate that both BPA and EE have dose- and sex-specific impacts on the cellular and microanatomical structures of the spleens that reveal minor alterations in immunomodulatory and hematopoietic functions. These findings support previous studies demonstrating the murine immune system as a sensitive target for estrogens, and that oral exposures to BPA and EE can have estrogen-like immunomodulatory affects in both sexes.",PMC5429804

However, this endpoint, as well as the integrity of the surrounding exocrine pancreas, is often overlooked in studies of developmental toxicology. Disruption of development by toxicants can alter cell fate and migration, resulting in structural alterations that are difficult to detect in mammalian embryo systems, but that are easily observed in the zebrafish embryo model (Danio rerio). Using endogenously expressed fluorescent protein markers for developing zebrafish beta cells and exocrine pancreas tissue, we documented differences in islet area and incidence rates of islet morphological variants in zebrafish embryos between 48 and 96 h post fertilization (hpf), raised under control conditions commonly used in embryotoxicity assays. We identified critical windows for chemical exposures during which increased incidences of endocrine pancreas abnormalities were observed following exposure to cyclopamine (2-12 hpf), Mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) (3-48 hpf), and Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) (3-48 hpf).

However, limited information is available on the effects of phthalate mixtures on female reproduction. Previously, we developed a phthalate mixture made of 35% diethyl phthalate, 21% di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 15% dibutyl phthalate, 15% di-isononyl phthalate, 8% di-isobutyl phthalate, and 5% benzylbutyl phthalate that mimics human exposure. We tested the effects of prenatal exposure to this mixture on reproductive outcomes in first-filial-generation (F1) female mice and found that it impaired reproductive outcomes. However, the impact of this exposure on second-filial-generation (F2) and third-filial-generation (F3) females was unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that prenatal exposure to the phthalate mixture induces multigenerational and transgenerational effects on female reproduction. Pregnant CD-1 dams were orally dosed with vehicle (tocopherol-stripped corn oil) or a phthalate mixture (20 and 200 µg/kg/d, 200 and 500 mg/kg/d) daily from gestational day 10 to birth. Adult F1 females born to these dams were used to generate the F2 generation and adult F2 females born to F1 females were used to generate the F3 generation. F2 and F3 females were subjected to tissue collections and fertility tests. Prenatal phthalate mixture exposure increased uterine weight, anogenital distance, and body weight; induced cystic ovaries; and caused fertility complications in the F2 generation. It also increased uterine weight, decreased anogenital distance, and caused fertility complications in the F3 generation. These data suggest that prenatal exposure to the phthalate mixture induces multigenerational and transgenerational effects on female reproduction.",PMC5460945

However, free phthalate can be ingested by hand-to-mouth action or by contact with food. To evaluate the effectiveness in removing phthalate exposure on hand, we compare here the removal efficiency of di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) on hands by handwashing with soap-and-water versus water-only. In two three-day N-of-1 trials, residual DEHP was measured in a single female adult who washed exposed hands with soap-and-water or water-only. Subsequently, a crossover study was performed by randomly assigning another 28 subjects equally to wash with soap-and-water or with water-only, and then each one received the other treatment 24 hrs later. In the N-of-1 trials, mean DEHP removal rates range from 95.9% (SD = 0.1%) to 97.0% (SD = 2.5%) for soap-and-water handwashes, and 1.8% (SD = 0.1%) to 7.0% (SD = 0.3%) (n = 3) for water-only. In the crossover study, mean removal rate was 94.6% (SD = 6.5%) for handwashing with soap-and-water (n = 28) and 8.7% (SD = 5.7%) for water-only (n = 28).

Tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) has been reported to increase adipogenesis; however, the mechanism(s) of action are unclear. Thy1 (CD90) is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein that serves as a marker for stem cells and also plays an important role in regulating adipogenesis and obesity. We investigated whether or not TBBPA promotes adipogenesis in human and mouse cells by reducing Thy1 levels. We further sought to identify the molecular mechanism(s) whereby TBBPA targets Thy1 expression. Mouse and human cells were exposed to TBBPA, and Thy1 expression was analyzed using flow cytometry, Western blotting, and qPCR. We tested whether microRNAs predicted to target Thy1 (miR-103 and miR-107) were upregulated by TBBPA using quantitative PCR assays. We also determined if Thy1 mRNA was a bona fide miR-103/107 target. Our results show that Thy1 expression was reduced in both human and mouse cells after exposure to TBBPA. Both Thy1 mRNA and protein levels were decreased by low-dose TBBPA exposure. TBBPA reduced Thy1 levels and further increased adipogenesis when an adipogenic medium was used. Mechanistically, we show that miR-103 and miR-107 are induced by TBBPA and that miR-103 targets Thy1 to reduce its expression. Our results reveal for the first time that Thy1 is a target of TBBPA.

Previously we showed that acute exposure to BPA promoted arrhythmias in female rat hearts through estrogen receptor rapid signaling. Progesterone (P4) and estrogen have antagonistic or complementary actions in a number of tissues and systems. In the current study, we examined the influence and possible protective effect of P4 on the rapid cardiac actions of BPA in female rat cardiac myocytes. Preincubation with physiological concentration (1 nM) of P4 abolished BPA-induced triggered activities in female cardiac myocytes. Further, P4 abrogated BPA-induced alterations in Ca2+ handling, including elevated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and Ca2+ load. Key to the inhibitory effect of P4 is its blockade of BPA-induced increase in the phosphorylation of phospholamban. At myocyte and protein levels, these inhibitory actions of P4 were blocked by pretreatment with the nuclear P4 receptor (nPR) antagonist RU486. Analysis using membrane-impermeable bovine serum albumin-conjugated P4 suggested that the actions of P4 were mediated by membrane-initiated signaling. Inhibitory G (Gi) protein and phophoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K), but not tyrosine protein kinase activation, were involved in the observed effects of P4. In conclusion, P4 exerts an acute protective effect against BPA-induced arrhythmogenesis in female cardiac myocytes through nPR and the Gi/PI3K signaling pathway. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of EDCs in the context of native hormonals and may provide potential therapeutic strategies for protection against the cardiac toxicities associated with BPA exposure.",PMC5460806

Growing evidence has demonstrated links between endocrine-disrupting chemicals, tissue development, and reproductive physiology, but the mechanisms of gene expression regulation by environmental factors that affect cell differentiation are unclear. Herein, we investigated the effects of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) on human endometrial mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (EN-MSC) differentiation and identified a novel signaling pathway. Differentiation of endometrial mesenchymal stem/stromal cells decreased after administration of BBP. We analyzed BBP regulation of gene expression in EN-MSC using cDNA microarrays and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software to identify affected target genes and their biological functions. PITX2 emerged as a common gene hit from separate screens targeting skeletal and muscular disorders, cell morphology, and tissue development. BBP decreased transcription of PITX2 and elevated expression of the microRNA miR-137, the predicted upstream negative regulator of PITX2. These data indicated that BBP affects PITX2 expression through miR-137 targeting of the 3' untranslated region of PITX2 mRNA. PITX2 down-regulation also decreased MyoD transcript levels in EN-MSC. Our results demonstrate that BBP decreases EN-MSC myogenic differentiation through up-regulation of miR-137, contribute to our understanding of EN-MSC differentiation, and underline the hazardous potential of environmental hormones.",PMC5428022

Controlling contaminations in the laboratory is challenging, especially when their source is unknown. Unfortunately, EDC contaminations can interfere with the interpretation of data during toxicological evaluations. We propose that the male CD-1 mouse mammary gland is a sensitive bioassay to evaluate the inadvertent contamination of animal colonies. We evaluated mammary glands collected from two CD-1 mouse populations with distinct environmental histories. Population 1 was born and raised in a commercial laboratory with unknown EDC exposures; Population 2 was the second generation raised in an animal facility with limited exposures to xenoestrogens from caging, feed, etc. Mammary glands were collected from all animals and evaluated using morphometric techniques to quantify morphological characteristics of the mammary gland. Population 1 (with suspected history of environmental chemical exposure) and Population 2 (with known limited history of xenoestrogen exposure) were morphologically distinguishable in adult males, prepubertal females, and pubertal females. Mammary glands from males raised in the commercial animal facility were significantly more developed, with larger ductal trees and more branching points. The appearance of these mammary glands was consistent with prior reports of male mice exposed to low doses of bisphenol A (BPA) during early development. In females, the two populations were morphologically distinct at both prepuberty and puberty, with the most striking differences observed in the number, size, and density of terminal end buds, e.g. highly proliferative structures found in the developing mammary gland. Collectively, these results suggest that the mouse mammary gland has the potential to be used as a sentinel organ to evaluate and distinguish animal colonies raised in different environmental conditions including potential EDC exposures. Our findings could help researchers that wish to perform a posteriori evaluations to determine whether inadvertent contamination with xenoestrogens (and potentially other EDCs) has occurred in their animal colonies, especially after new materials (feed, caging, water bottles) have been introduced. Finally, our results challenge the relatively common practice of using historical controls in toxicological experiments.",PMC5345180

These chemotactic molecules are crucial in orchestrating appropriate cellular homing, osteoblastogenesis, and osteoclastogenesis during normal bone repair. Bone healing is a complex cascade of carefully regulated processes, including inflammation, progenitor cell recruitment, differentiation, and remodeling. The extensive role of chemokines in these processes and the known links between environmental contaminants and chemokine expression/activity leaves ample opportunity for disruption of bone healing by environmental factors. However, despite increased clinical awareness, the potential impact of many of these environmental factors on bone-related chemokines is still ill defined. A great deal of focus has been placed on environmental exposure to various endocrine disruptors (bisphenol A, phthalate esters, etc.), volatile organic compounds, dioxins, and heavy metals, though mainly in other tissues. Awareness of the impact of other less well-studied bone toxicants, such as fluoride, mold and fungal toxins, asbestos, and chlorine, is also reviewed. In many cases, the literature on these toxins in osteogenic models is lacking.

Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental toxicant that is commonly found in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, has received much attention due to its estrogenic activity and high risk of chronic exposure in human. Whereas BPA has been linked to infertility and recurrent miscarriage in women, the impact of its exposure on uterine function during early pregnancy remains unclear. In a recent publication in Endocrinology, we demonstrated that prolonged exposure to an environmental relevant dose of BPA disrupts progesterone receptor-regulated uterine functions, thus affecting uterine receptivity for embryo implantation and decidua morphogenesis, two critical events for establishment and maintenance of early pregnancy. In particular we reported a marked impairment of progesterone receptor (PGR) expression and its downstream effector HAND2 in the uterine stromal cells in response to chronic BPA exposure. In an earlier study we have shown that HAND2 controls embryo implantation by repressing fibroblast growth factor (FGF) expression and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, thus inhibiting epithelial proliferation. Interestingly we observed that downregulation of PGR and HAND2 expression in uterine stroma upon BPA exposure was associated with an enhanced activation of FGFR and MAPK signaling, aberrant proliferation, and lack of uterine receptivity in the epithelium. In addition, the proliferation and differentiation of endometrial stromal cells to decidual cells, an event critical for the maintenance of early pregnancy, was severely compromised in response to BPA. This research highlight will provide an overview of our findings and discuss the potential mechanisms by which chronic BPA impairs PGR-HAND2 pathway and adversely affects implantation and the establishment of pregnancy.",PMC5321573

To rule out that germ cell(GC) apoptosis itself is responsible for macrophage recruitment, rats were exposed to a direct GC toxicant, methoxyacetic acid (MAA), but no infiltration of macrophages was observed. Next, mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines were evaluated after MEHP exposure.

In California mice, developmental exposure to BPA results in sociosexual disorders at adulthood, including communication and biparental care deficits, behaviors that are primarily regulated by the hypothalamus. Thus, we sought to examine the transcriptomic profile in this brain region of juvenile male and female California mice offspring exposed from periconception through lactation to BPA or ethinyl estradiol (EE, estrogen present in birth control pills and considered a positive estrogen control for BPA studies).

Kcnd3 was downregulated in the hypothalamus of BPA- and EE-exposed females, whereas Tbl2, Topors, Kif3a, and Phactr2 were upregulated in these groups. Comparison of transcripts differentially expressed in BPA and EE groups revealed significant enrichment of gene ontology terms associated with microtubule-based processes.

Although regarded as endocrine disruptors, these chemicals are suspected to exert nongenomic actions on muscle function that are not well understood. Using skeletal muscle microsomes, we examined the effects of BPA and TBBPA on ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1), dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), and sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). We assessed the impact of these chemicals on Ca2+ dynamics and signaling in embryonic skeletal myotubes through fluorescent Ca2+ imaging and measurement of resting membrane potential (Vm). TBBPA activated RyR1 and inhibited DHPR and SERCA, inducing a net efflux of Ca2+ from loaded microsomes, whereas BPA exhibited little or no activity at these targets. Regardless, both compounds disrupted the function of intact myotubes. TBBPA diminished and eventually abrogated Ca2+ transients, altered intracellular Ca2+ equilibrium, and caused Vm depolarization. For some cells, BPA caused rapid Ca2+ transient loss without marked changes in cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ levels, likely owing to altered cellular excitability as a result of BPA-induced Vm hyperpolarization. BPA and TBBPA both interfere with skeletal muscle function through divergent mechanisms that impair excitation-contraction coupling and may be exemplary of their adverse outcomes in other muscle types.",PMC5363716

In the present study, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to 300 mg/kg/day DEHP during a critical period for gonads differentiation to testes on male mice offspring reproductive parameters, including the genome-wide RNA expression and associated promoter methylation status in the sperm of the first filial generation. It was observed that adult male offspring displayed symptoms similar to the human testicular dysgenesis syndrome. A combination of sperm transcriptome and methylome data analysis allowed to detect a long-lasting DEHP-induced and robust promoter methylation-associated silencing of almost the entire cluster of the seminal vesicle secretory proteins and antigen genes, which are known to play a fundamental role in sperm physiology. It also resulted in the detection of a DEHP-induced promoter demethylation associated with an up-regulation of three genes apparently not relevant for sperm physiology and partially related to the immune system. As previously reported, DEHP induced an increase in mir-615 microRNA expression and a genome-wide decrease in microRNA promoter methylation. A functional analysis revealed DEHP-induced enrichments in down-regulated gene transcripts coding for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways, and in up-regulated gene transcripts coding for calcium binding and numerous myosin proteins. All these enriched pathways and networks have been described to be associated in some way with the reproductive system. This study identifies a large new array of genes dysregulated by DEHP that may play a role in the complex system controlling the development of the male reproductive system.",PMC5234833

Congeners were extracted using a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe (QuEChERS) method, purified by gel permeation chromatography, and quantified using gas chromatography-triple quadruple mass spectrometry. PBDEs and PCBs were detected in all FFM and WM samples. The most prevalent PBDE congeners in WM were BDE-47 (geometric mean: 18.0 pg/mL, 0.51 ng/g lipid), BDE-99 (geometric mean: 9.9 pg/mL, 0.28 ng/g lipid), and BDE-49 (geometric mean: 6.0 pg/mL, 0.17 ng/g lipid). The dominant PCB congeners in WM were PCB-101(geometric mean: 23.6 pg/mL, 0.67 ng/g lipid), PCB-118 (geometric mean: 25.2 pg/mL, 0.72 ng/g lipid), and PCB-138 (geometric mean: 25.3 pg/mL, 0.72 ng/g lipid). The sum of all 19 PCB congeners in FFM and WM were several orders of magnitude below the U.S. FDA tolerance. The sum of PBDEs in milk samples suggest close proximity to industrial emissions, and confirm previous findings of elevated PBDE levels in California compared to other regions in the United States.",PMC5234792

This study tested a hypothesis that prenatal exposure to DEHP lays the foundation for premature gonadal dysfunction and subsequent reproductive senescence in male mice. Pregnant female CD-1 mice were orally dosed with vehicle control (tocopherol-stripped corn oil) or with 20 μg/kg/day, 200 μg/kg/day, 500 mg/kg/day, or 750 mg/kg/day of DEHP from gestational day 11 to birth. Overall, the prenatal DEHP exposure did not cause any overt physical health problems in male offspring, as no significant differences in their body nor gonadal weight were seen up to the age of 23 months. However, an age- and dose-dependent gonadal dysfunction was observed. As early as 7 months of age, the 750 mg/kg/day group of mice exhibited significantly reduced fertility. At 19 months of age, 86% of the 750 mg/kg/day mice became infertile, whereas only 25% of the control mice were infertile. At this age, all of the DEHP-exposed mice had lower serum testosterone levels, higher serum estradiol levels, and higher LH levels compared with control mice. Histological evaluations showed that mice prenatally exposed to DEHP displayed a wide array of gonadal and epididymal abnormalities such as increased germ cell apoptosis, degenerative seminiferous tubules, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, and teratozoospermia in comparison to age-matching control mice. In summary, this study shows that prenatal exposure to DEHP induces premature reproductive senescence in male mice.",PMC6075616

Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that the manifestation and severity of adverse outcomes is the result of interaction between developmental insults and the prevailing environment. Consistent with this premise, recent studies in sheep found prenatal BPA treatment prevented the adverse effects of postnatal obesity in inducing hypertension. The gene networks underlying these complex interactions are not known. mRNA-seq of myocardium was performed on four groups of four female sheep to assess the effects of prenatal BPA exposure, postnatal overfeeding and their interaction on gene transcription, pathway perturbations and functional effects. The effects of prenatal exposure to BPA, postnatal overfeeding, and prenatal BPA with postnatal overfeeding all resulted in transcriptional changes (85-141 significant differentially expressed genes). Although the effects of prenatal BPA and postnatal overfeeding did not involve dysregulation of many of the same genes, they affected a remarkably similar set of biological pathways. Furthermore, an additive or synergistic effect was not found in the combined treatment group, but rather prenatal BPA treatment led to a partial reversal of the effects of overfeeding alone. Many genes previously known to be affected by BPA and involved in obesity, hypertension, or heart disease were altered following these treatments, and AP-1, EGR1, and EGFR were key hubs affected by BPA and/or overfeeding.

In order to elucidate roles of the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways and hepatic enzymes in thyroid-disrupting effects of DEHP, Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed with DEHP by gavage for 30 consecutive days; Nthy-ori 3-1 cells were treated with DEHP with NAC, k-Ras siRNA or inhibitors (U0126 and wortmannin). Results showed that DEHP led to histopathologic changes in rat thyroid and liver, such as the decrease in thyroid follicular cavity diameter, hepatocyte edema. Triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were reduced. DEHP caused ROS production, oxidative stress and k-Ras upregulation, thereby activating the ERK and Akt pathways in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, TRH receptor (TRHr) level was elevated after the activation of the Akt pathway and was downregulated after the inhibition of the Akt pathway. However, TRHr was not modulated by the ERK pathway. Additionally, hepatic enzymes, including Ugt1a1, CYP2b1, Sult1e1, and Sult2b1, were significantly induced after DEHP exposure. Taken together, DEHP can perturb TH homeostasis and reduce TH levels.

Upon ligand binding, the LBP reshapes around the contours of the ligand and stabilizes the complex by complementary hydrophobic interactions and specific hydrogen bonds with the ligand. Here we present a framework for quantitative analysis of the steric and electronic features of the human ERα-ligand complex using three dimensional (3D) protein-ligand interaction description combined with 3D-QSAR approach. An empirical hydrophobicity density field is applied to account for hydrophobic contacts of ligand within the LBP. The obtained 3D-QSAR model revealed that hydrophobic contacts primarily determine binding affinity and govern binding mode with hydrogen bonds. Several residues of the LBP appear to be quite flexible and adopt a spectrum of conformations in various ERα-ligand complexes, in particular His524. The 3D-QSAR was combined with molecular docking based on three receptor conformations to accommodate receptor flexibility. The model indicates that the dynamic character of the LBP allows accommodation and stable binding of structurally diverse ligands, and proper representation of the protein flexibility is critical for reasonable description of binding of the ligands. Our results provide a quantitative and mechanistic understanding of binding affinity and mode of ERα agonists and antagonists that may be applicable to other nuclear receptors.",PMC5218732

Exposure to environmental chemicals such as phthalates, ubiquitously found in humans, may also generate reactive oxygen species and subsequent oxidative stress. We examined longitudinal changes of 8-isoprostane urinary concentrations, a validated biomarker of oxidative stress, and associations with maternal prenatal urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites for 258 children at 5, 9 and 14 years of age participating in a birth cohort residing in an agricultural area in California. Phthalates are endocrine disruptors, and in utero exposure has been also linked to altered lipid metabolism, as well as adverse birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. We found that median creatinine-corrected 8-isoprostane concentrations remained constant across all age groups and did not differ by sex. Total cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were positively associated with 8-isoprostane in 14-year-old children. No associations were observed between 8-isoprostane and body mass index (BMI), BMI Z-score or waist circumference at any age. Concentrations of three metabolites of high molecular weight phthalates measured at 13 weeks of gestation (monobenzyl, monocarboxyoctyl and monocarboxynonyl phthalates) were negatively associated with 8-isoprostane concentrations among 9-year olds. However, at 14 years of age, isoprostane concentrations were positively associated with two other metabolites (mono(2-ethylhexyl) and mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalates) measured in early pregnancy.

Most studies on phthalates have focused on single phthalates, but it is important to study mixtures of phthalates because humans are exposed to such mixtures daily. We tested the hypothesis that phthalate mixture exposure decreases antral follicle growth, compromises steroidogenic capacity, and induces atresia. Antral follicles from adult CD-1 mice were cultured with vehicle control or phthalate mixture (1-500 µg/ml) for 96 h. The mixture was made of 35% diethyl phthalate, 21% di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 15% dibutyl phthalate, 15% diisononyl phthalate, 8% diisobutyl phthalate, and 5% benzylbutyl phthalate. During culture, antral follicle diameters were measured every 24 h to monitor growth. After culture, media were subjected to measurements of sex steroid hormones and follicles were subjected to evaluation of gene expression and atresia. The phthalate mixture (100 and 500 µg/ml) decreased antral follicle growth starting at 24 h compared to controls. The mixture at 10, 100, and 500 µg/ml also decreased androstenedione, testosterone, estrone, and estradiol levels compared to control. The mixture (10, 100, and 500 µg/ml) reduced atresia rating, but it induced more oocyte fragmentation compared to control. The phthalate mixture at different doses adversely affected cell cycle regulators, antioxidant enzymes, apoptotic factors, steroidogenic enzymes, and receptors. Collectively, these data indicate that exposure to an environmentally relevant phthalate mixture reduces antral follicle growth, induces oocyte fragmentation, and decreases hormone production by adversely affecting the expression of cell cycle regulators, apoptotic factors, steroidogenic enzymes, and receptors.",PMC6075604

Isoprostane levels were on average 20% higher at 26 weeks than at 13 weeks of pregnancy. Urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations suggested relatively consistent phthalate exposures over pregnancy. The relationship between phthalate metabolite concentrations and isoprostane levels was significant for the sum of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and the sum of high molecular weight metabolites with the exception of monobenzyl phthalate, which was not associated with oxidative stress at either time point. In contrast, low molecular weight metabolite concentrations were not associated with isoprostane at 13 weeks, but this relationship became stronger later in pregnancy (p-value = 0.009 for the sum of low molecular weight metabolites).

We have previously shown that chronic and developmental exposure to BPA is associated with increased prostate cancer (PCa) risk in human and animal models. Here, we examine whether exposure of PCa cells (LNCaP, C4-2) to low-dose BPA and its structural analogues (BPS, BPF, BPAF, TBBPA, DMBPA and TMBPA) affects centrosome amplification (CA), a hallmark of cancer initiation and progression. We found that exposure to BPA, BPS, DMBPA and TBBPA, in descending order, increased the number of cells with CA, in a non-monotonic dose-response manner. Furthermore, cells treated with BPA and their analogues initiated centrosome duplication at 8 h after release from serum starvation, significantly earlier in G-1 phase than control cells. This response was attended by earlier release of nucleophosmin from unduplicated centrosomes. BPA-exposed cells exhibited increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase CDK6 and decreased expression of CDK inhibitors (p21Waf1/CIP1 and p27KIP1). Using specific antagonists for estrogen/androgen receptors, CA in the presence of BPA or its analogues was likely to be mediated via ESR1 signaling. Change in microtubule dynamics was observed on exposure to these analogues, which, for BPA, was accompanied by increased expression of centrosome-associated protein CEP350 Similar to BPA, chronic treatment of cells with DMBPA, but not other analogues, resulted in the enhancement of anchorage-independent growth. We thus conclude that selected BPA analogues, similar to BPA, disrupt centrosome function and microtubule organization, with DMBPA displaying the broadest spectrum of cancer-promoting effects.",PMC5226663

Male, but not female, urinary concentrations of select metabolites of phthalates and phthalate alternatives are associated with diminished blastocyst quality. Although phthalates are endocrine disrupting compounds associated with adverse reproductive health, they are in widespread use across the world. Male and female preconception exposures to select phthalates have been previously associated with adverse reproductive outcomes in both the general population and in those undergoing IVF. This prospective cohort included 50 subfertile couples undergoing IVF in western Massachusetts. This study includes the first 50 couples recruited from the Baystate Medical Center's Fertility Center in Springfield, MA, as part of the Sperm Environmental Epigenetics and Development Study (SEEDS). Relevant data from both partners, including embryo quality at the cleavage (Day 3) and blastocyst (Day 5) stages, were collected by clinic personnel during the normal course of an IVF cycle. A spot urine sample was collected from both male and female partners on the same day as semen sample procurement and oocyte retrieval. Concentrations of 17 urinary metabolite were quantified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and normalized via specific gravity. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI, with urinary phthalates and phthalate alternatives fitted as continuous variables and embryo quality as a binary variable. The 50 couples contributed 761 oocytes, of which 423 progressed to the cleavage stage, 261 were high-quality cleavage stage embryos, 137 were transferrable quality blastocysts and 47 were high-quality blastocysts. At the cleavage stage, male urinary monoethyl phthalate concentrations were positively associated with high-quality cleavage stage embryos (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.43, P = 0.04); no other significant associations were observed at this stage. At the blastocyst stage, male urinary concentrations of monobenzyl phthalate (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.36-0.84, P = 0.01), mono-3-hydroxybutyl phthalate (OR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.76, P = 0.01), mono-n-butyl phthalate (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.73, P < 0.01) and monomethyl phthalate (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.26-0.60, P < 0.01) were inversely associated with high-quality blastocysts. A borderline statistically significant relationship was observed for male concentrations of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (OR = 0.52, 95% CI 0.27-1.00, P = 0.05) and cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-monocarboxy isooctyl ester (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.04-1.03, P = 0.05) at the blastocyst stage. Similar inverse associations were observed between male urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and likelihood of transferrable quality blastocysts. For female partners, select metabolites were positively associated with odds of high or transferrable blastocyst quality, but the observed associations were not consistent across blastocyst quality measures or between sex-specific and couples-level models. All models were adjusted for age of both partners, urinary metabolite concentrations of female partners and male infertility status, while models of blastocysts were additionally adjusted for embryo quality at cleavage stage. Our modest sample included only 50 couples contributing one cycle each. In addition, non-differential misclassification of exposure remains a concern given the single-spot urine collection and the short half-life of phthalates. Our results suggest an inverse association between male preconception concentrations of select phthalate metabolites and blastocyst quality, likely occurring after genomic activation.

In order to explore the molecular pathways stimulated by BPA during amelogenesis, we thoroughly investigated the receptors known to directly or indirectly mediate the effects of BPA. The expression patterns of high affinity BPA receptors (ERRγ, GPR30), of ketosteroid receptors (ERs, AR, PGR, GR, MR), of the retinoid receptor RXRα, and PPARγ were established using RT-qPCR analysis of RNAs extracted from microdissected enamel organ of adult rats. Their expression was dependent on the stage of ameloblast differentiation, except that of ERβ and PPARγ which remained undetectable. An additional large scale microarray analysis revealed three main groups of receptors according to their level of expression in maturation-stage ameloblasts. The expression level of RXRα was the highest, similar to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), whereas the others were 13 to 612-fold lower, with AR and GR being intermediate. Immunofluorescent analysis of VDR, ERα and AR confirmed their presence mainly in maturation- stage ameloblasts.

Forty-eight pubertal female rats were randomly divided into four groups and respectively administered via oral gavage 0, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/d DEHP in 0.1 mL corn oil/20 g body weight for up to four weeks. Compared with control rats, the DEHP-treated rats showed: (1) higher gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) level in the hypothalamus; (2) higher protein levels of GnRH in the hypothalamus; and (3) higher mRNA and protein levels of GnRH receptor (GnRHR) in the uterus. Our data reveal that DEHP exposure may lead to a disruption in pubertal female rats and an imbalance of hypothalamus-uterus. Meanwhile, DEHP may, through the GnRH in the hypothalamus and its receptor on the uterus, lead to diseases of the uterus. DEHP may impose a negative influence on the development and functioning of the reproductive system in pubertal female rats.",PMC5129340

Exposure to BPA during development can disrupt sexual differentiation of some brain regions. Moreover, BPA can have transgenerational effects on gene expression and behaviors. Here, we used a diet and breeding regimen that produces transgenerational effects on behaviors. C57BL/6J mice consumed control or BPA-containing diets during pregnancy. We examined vasopressin (AVP) and estrogen receptor α (ERα) immunoreactivity (ir) in sexually dimorphic brain regions from first-generation (F1) offspring and transgenerational effects of BPA in third-generation offspring. In all but one brain region examined, the expected sex differences were noted in both generations of control mice. In F1 mice, a diet by sex interaction was present for AVP-ir in the lateral septum and posterodorsal medial amygdala. In both regions, BPA exposure reduced immunoreactivity in male brains. An interaction between diet and sex for ERα-ir in the ventromedial hypothalamus was caused by reduced immunoreactivity in BPA-exposed females. Of interest, BPA had transgenerational effects on ERα-ir in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Our data show that BPA produces immunoreactive differences in ERα-ir generations after exposure to BPA. We speculate that actions of BPA in utero on ERα-ir in brain have long-term consequences for reproduction and social behavior.",PMC5412975

To achieve these goals, we developed a total BPA assay utilizing derivatization with pentafluorobenzyl followed by analysis with LC-ECAPCI-MS/MS with a limit of detection of 0.08ng/mL and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.25ng/mL. The mean BW of infants with AF BPA 0.40-2.0ng/mL was 241.8g less than infants with AF BPA less than the LOQ after controlling for covariates (p=0.049).

Animal studies have associated perinatal bisphenol A (BPA) exposure to altered DNA methylation, but these studies are often limited to candidate gene and global non-loci-specific approaches. By using an epigenome-wide discovery platform, we elucidated epigenetic alterations in liver tissue from adult mice offspring (10 months) following perinatal BPA exposure at human physiologically relevant doses (50-ng, 50-μg, and 50-mg BPA/kg diet). Biological pathway analysis identified an enrichment of significant differentially methylated regions in metabolic pathways among females. Furthermore, through the use of top enriched biological pathways, 4 candidate genes were chosen to assess DNA methylation as a mediating factor linking the association of perinatal BPA exposure to metabolic phenotypes previously observed in female offspring. DNA methylation status at Janus kinase-2 (Jak-2), retinoid X receptor (Rxr), regulatory factor x-associated protein (Rfxap), and transmembrane protein 238 (Tmem238) was used within a mediational regression analysis. DNA methylation in all four of the candidate genes was identified as a mediator in the mechanistic pathway of developmental BPA exposure and female-specific energy expenditure, body weight, and body fat phenotypes. Data generated from this study are crucial for deciphering the mechanistic role of epigenetics in the pathogenesis of chronic disease and the development of epigenetic-based prevention and therapeutic strategies for complex human disease.",PMC5412976

Prenatal exposure to BPA is known to affect birth weight, but its impact on the cardiovascular system has not been studied in detail. In this study, we investigated the effects of prenatal BPA treatment and its interaction with postnatal overfeeding on the cardiovascular system. Pregnant sheep were given daily subcutaneous injections of corn oil (control) or BPA (0.5 mg/kg/day in corn oil) from day 30 to day 90 of gestation. A subset of female offspring of these dams were overfed to increase body weight to ~30% over that of normal fed controls. Cardiovascular function was assessed using non-invasive echocardiography and cuff blood pressure (BP) monitoring at 21 months of age. Ventricular tissue was analyzed for gene expression of cardiac markers of hypertrophy and collagen at the end of the observation period. Prenatal BPA exposure had no significant effect on BP or morphometric measures. However, it increased atrial natriuretic peptide gene expression in the ventricles and reduced collagen expression in the right ventricle. Overfeeding produced a marked increase in body weight and BP. There were compensatory increases in left ventricular area and internal diameter. Prenatal BPA treatment produced a significant increase in interventricular septal thickness when animals were overfed. However, it appeared to block the increase in BP and left ventricular area caused by overfeeding. Taken together, these results suggest that prenatal BPA produces intrinsic changes in the heart that are capable of modulating morphological and functional parameters when animals become obese in later life.",PMC5505257

Whether PCBs alter other sexually dimorphic behaviors such as those involved in anxiety is poorly understood. To address this, pregnant rat dams were injected twice, on gestational days 16 and 18, with the weakly estrogenic PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221) at one of two low dosages (0.5mg/kg or 1.0mg/kg, hereafter 1.0 and 0.5), estradiol benzoate (EB; 50μg/kg) as a positive estrogenic control, or the vehicle (3% DMSO in sesame oil). We also conducted a comprehensive assessment of developmental milestones of the F1 male and female offspring. There were no effects of treatment on sex ratio at birth and age at eye opening. Puberty, assessed by vaginal opening in females and preputial separation in males, was not affected in females but was advanced in males treated with A1221 (1.0). Males and females treated with A1221 (both dosages) were heavier in early adulthood relative to controls. The earliest manifestation of this effect developed in males prior to puberty and in females slightly later, during puberty. Anxiety-like behaviors were tested using the light:dark box and elevated plus maze tests in adulthood. In females, anxiety behaviors were unaffected by treatment. Males treated with A1221 (1.0) showed reduced indices of anxiety and increased activity in the light:dark box but not the elevated plus maze. EB failed to replicate the phenotype produced by A1221 for any of the developmental and behavioral endpoints. Collectively, these results indicate that PCBs increase body weight in both sexes, but their effects on anxiety-like behaviors are specific to males. Furthermore, differences between the results of A1221 and EB suggest that the PCBs are likely acting through mechanisms distinct from their estrogenic activity.",PMC5603326

Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including bisphenol A (BPA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE), especially during development, may also increase the risk for such disorders. An unexplored possibility is that EDC-exposure might alter the gut microbial composition. Gut flora and their products may thus be mediating factors for the disease-causing effects of these chemicals. To examine the effects of EDCs on the gut microbiome, female and male monogamous and biparental California mice (Peromyscus californicus) were exposed to BPA (50 mg/kg feed weight) or EE (0.1 ppb) or control diet from periconception through weaning. 16s rRNA sequencing was performed on bacterial DNA isolated from fecal samples, and analyses performed for P0 and F1 males and females. Both BPA and EE induced generational and sex-dependent gut microbiome changes. Many of the bacteria, e.g. Bacteroides, Mollicutes, Prevotellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Akkermansia, Methanobrevibacter, Sutterella, whose proportions increase with exposure to BPA or EE in the P0 or F1 generation are associated with different disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), metabolic disorders, and colorectal cancer. However, the proportion of the beneficial bacterium, Bifidobacterium, was also elevated in fecal samples of BPA- and EE-exposed F1 females. Intestinal flora alterations were also linked to changes in various metabolic and other pathways.

Unlike the constitutively nuclear TRβ, this GFP-GR-TRβ chimera is cytoplasmic in the absence of hormone while translocating to the nucleus in a time- and concentration-dependent manner upon stimulation with triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroid hormone analogue, TRIAC, while the reverse triiodothyronine (3,3',5'-triiodothyronine, or rT3) was inactive.

DEHP is used as a plasticizer in medical devices and many commercial and household items. Exposure occurs through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. DEHP is metabolized to a primary metabolite mono-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (MEHP) in the body, which is further metabolized to four major secondary metabolites, mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)phthalate (5-OH-MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxyhexyl)phthalate (5-oxo-MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl)phthalate (5-cx-MEPP) and mono[2-(carboxymethyl)hexyl]phthalate (2-cx-MMHP). DEHP and its metabolites are associated with developmental abnormalities and reproductive dysfunction within the human population. Progesterone receptor (PR) signaling is involved in important reproductive functions and is a potential target for endocrine disrupting activities of DEHP and its metabolites. This study used in silico approaches for structural binding analyses of DEHP and its five indicated major metabolites with PR. Protein Data bank was searched to retrieve the crystal structure of human PR (Id: 1SQN). PubChem database was used to obtain the structures of DEHP and its five metabolites. Docking was performed using Glide (Schrodinger) Induced Fit Docking module. DEHP and its metabolites interacted with 19-25 residues of PR with the majority of the interacting residues overlapping (82-95 % commonality) with the native bound ligand norethindrone (NET). DEHP and each of its five metabolites formed a hydrogen bonding interaction with residue Gln-725 of PR. The binding affinity was highest for NET followed by DEHP, 5-OH-MEHP, 5-oxo-MEHP, MEHP, 5-cx-MEPP, and 2-cx-MMHP.

Thus, we exposed CD-1 mice to BPA (0, 1, and 100 mg/l BPA in the drinking water) orally during puberty (from postnatal days 28 to 56) and investigated whether pubertal BPA exposure exacerbates the age-related impairment of spatial cognition in old age (18 months old) and whether serum sex and thyroid hormones or hippocampal histone acetylation (H3K9ac and H4K8ac) are associated with cognitive effects. A young control group (6 months old) was added to analyze the age effect. Results showed untreated aged mice had marked decline of spatial learning and memory in the novel location recognition and radial six-arm water maze tasks, with decreased levels of these hormones and hippocampal H3K9ac and H4K8ac compared to young controls. The BPA treatment exacerbated age-related spatial cognitive impairment and accelerated the reduction of free thyroxine (FT4), H3K9ac, and H4K8ac, and the 100 mg/l BPA group showed more significant impact. Additionally, correlation analyses revealed that lower levels of FT4, H3K9ac, and H4K8ac were accompanied by decreased spatial memory abilities.

Exposure to BPA may bring about possible human toxicities, such as cancerous tumors, birth defects and neoteny. One of the key issues to understand its toxicities is how BPA enters cells. In this paper, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to explore the interactions between BPA and a phospholipid membrane (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, DPPC bilayer). The simulation results show that BPA can easily enter the membrane from the aqueous phase. With the increasing concentrations of BPA in the membrane, BPA tends to aggregate and form into cluster. Meanwhile, several DPPC lipids are pulled out from each leaflet and adsorbed on the cluster surface, leading to pore formation. Detailed observations indicate that the lipid extraction results mainly from the dispersion interactions between BPA cluster and lipid tails, as well as weak electrostatic attractions between lipid headgroups and the two hydroxyl groups on BPA. The lipid extraction and pore formation may cause cell membrane damage and are of great importance to uncover BPA's cytotoxicity.",PMC5024305

We studied whether in utero exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds might explain these variations. We describe a novel ER+ breast cancer model to study de novo and acquired tamoxifen (TAM) resistance. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 0 or 0.1 ppm ethinyl estradiol (EE2), and the response of 9,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors to 15 mg/kg TAM, with (n = 17 tumors in the controls and n = 20 tumors in EE2 offspring) or without 1.2 g/kg valproic acid and 5 mg/kg hydralazine (n = 24 tumors in the controls and n = 32 tumors in EE2 offspring) in the female offspring, was assessed. One-sided Chi2 tests were used to calculate P values. Comparisons of differentially expressed genes between mammary tumors in in utero EE2-exposed and control rats, and between anti-estrogen-resistant LCC9 and -sensitive LCC1 human breast cancer cells, were also performed. In our preclinical model, 54.2% of mammary tumors in the control rats exhibited a complete response to TAM, of which 23.1% acquired resistance with continued anti-estrogen treatment and recurred. Mammary tumors in the EE2 offspring were statistically significantly less likely to respond to TAM (P = .047) and recur (P = .007). In the EE2 offspring, but not in controls, adding valproic acid and hydralazine to TAM prevented recurrence (P < .001). Three downregulated and hypermethylated genes (KLF4, LGALS3, MICB) and one upregulated gene (ETV4) were identified in EE2 tumors and LCC9 breast cancer cells, and valproic acid and hydralazine normalized the altered expression of all four genes. Resistance to TAM may be preprogrammed by in utero exposure to high estrogen levels and mediated through reversible epigenetic alterations in genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumor immune responses.",PMC6255695

It acts as an endocrine disruptor targeting steroid hormone receptors, such as the estrogen receptor (ER), estrogen-related receptor (ERR) and androgen receptor (AR). BPA-derived molecules have recently been shown to interact with the AR N-terminal domain (AR-NTD), which is known to be largely intrinsically disordered. This N-terminal domain contains an 11 residue conserved domain that forms amyloid fibers upon oxidative dimerisation through its strictly conserved Cys240 residue. We investigate here the interaction of BPA, and other potential endocrine disruptors, with AR-NTD amyloid fibers using the WaterLOGSY NMR experiment. We observed a selective binding of these compounds to the amyloid fibers formed by the AR-NTD conserved region and glutamine homopolymers. This observation suggests that the high potency of endocrine disruptors may result, in part, from their ability to bind amyloid forms of nuclear receptors in addition to their cognate binding sites. This property may be exploited to design future therapeutic strategies targeting AR related diseases such as the spinal bulbar muscular atrophy or prostate cancer. The ability of NMR WaterLOGSY experiments to detect weak interactions between small ligands and amyloid fibers may prove to be of particular interest for identifying promising hit molecules.",PMC5008648

We have previously shown that 23 of 24 commonly used hydraulic fracturing chemicals can activate or inhibit the estrogen, androgen, glucocorticoid, progesterone, and/or thyroid receptors in a human endometrial cancer cell reporter gene assay and that mixtures can behave synergistically, additively, or antagonistically on these receptors. In the current study, pregnant female C57Bl/6 dams were exposed to a mixture of 23 commonly used unconventional oil and gas chemicals at approximately 3, 30, 300, and 3000 μg/kg·d, flutamide at 50 mg/kg·d, or a 0.2% ethanol control vehicle via their drinking water from gestational day 11 through birth. This prenatal exposure to oil and gas operation chemicals suppressed pituitary hormone concentrations across experimental groups (prolactin, LH, FSH, and others), increased body weights, altered uterine and ovary weights, increased heart weights and collagen deposition, disrupted folliculogenesis, and other adverse health effects. This work suggests potential adverse developmental and reproductive health outcomes in humans and animals exposed to these oil and gas operation chemicals, with adverse outcomes observed even in the lowest dose group tested, equivalent to concentrations reported in drinking water sources.

Bisphenol-A (BPA), a main component of polycarbonate plastics, has been receiving increased attention due to its worldwide distribution with a large exposure. In humans, BPA, for its estrogenic activity, may have a role in autoimmunity, inflammatory and allergic diseases. To this aim, we assessed the effect of low BPA doses on functionality of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and on in vitro differentiation of dendritic cells from monocytes (mDCs). Fresh peripheral blood samples were obtained from 12 healthy adult volunteers. PBMCs were left unstimulated or were activated with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or the anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and incubated in presence or absence of BPA at 0.1 and 1nM concentrations. The immune-modulatory effect of BPA was assessed by evaluating the cell proliferation and the levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) secreted by PBMCs. mDCs were differentiated with IL-4 and GC-CSF with or without BPA and the expression of differentiation/maturation markers (CD11c, CD1a, CD86, HLA-DR) was evaluated by flow cytometry; furthermore, a panel of 27 different cytokines, growth factors and chemokines were assayed in the mDC culture supernatants. PBMCs proliferation significantly increased upon BPA exposure compared to BPA untreated cells. In addition, a significant decrease in IL-10 secretion was observed in PBMCs incubated with BPA, either in unstimulated or mitogen-stimulated cells, and at both 0.1 and 1nM BPA concentrations. Similarly, IL-13 was reduced, mainly in cells activated by antiCD3/CD28. By contrast, no significant changes in IFN-γ and IL-4 production were found in any condition assayed. Finally, BPA at 1nM increased the density of dendritic cells expressing CD1a and concomitantly decreased the expression of HLA-DR and CD86 activation markers. In conclusion, in humans the exposure to BPA causes on PBMCs a significant modulation of proliferative capacity and cytokine production, and on mDCs alteration in differentiation and phenotype. These immune cell alterations suggest that low dose chronic exposure to BPA could be involved in immune deregulation and possibly in the increased susceptibility to develop inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",PMC4980038

27478869,"Lauren Prusinski, Ayman Al-Hendy, Qiwei Yang",Developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals alters the epigenome: Identification of reprogrammed targets.,2016,"Endocrine disruptions induced by environmental toxicants have placed an immense burden on society to properly diagnose, treat and attempt to alleviate symptoms and disease. Environmental exposures during critical periods of development can permanently reprogram normal physiological responses, thereby increasing susceptibility to disease later in life - a process known as developmental reprogramming. During development, organogenesis and tissue differentiation occur through a continuous series of tightly-regulated and precisely-timed molecular, biochemical and cellular events. Humans may encounter endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) daily and during all stages of life, from conception and fetal development through adulthood and senescence. Though puberty and perimenopausal periods may be affected by endocrine disruption due to hormonal effects, prenatal and early postnatal windows are most critical for proper development due to rapid changes in system growth. Developmental reprogramming is shown to be caused by alterations in the epigenome. Development is the time when epigenetic programs are 'installed' on the genome by 'writers', such as histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which add methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues on histone tails and to CpG sites in DNA, respectively. A number of environmental compounds, referred to as estrogenic endocrine disruptors (EEDs), are able to bind to estrogen receptors (ERs) and interfere with the normal cellular development in target tissues including the prostate and uterus. These EEDs, including diethylstilbestrol (DES), bisphenol A (BPA), and genistein (a phytoestrogen derived from soybeans), have been implicated in the malformation of reproductive organs and later development of disease. Due to the lack of fully understanding the underlying mechanisms of how environmental toxicants and their level of exposure affect the human genome, it can be challenging to create clear clinical guidance to address the potential health effects of lower-level exposures commonly experienced within the general population. In addition, human studies concerning environmental exposures are limited in feasibility by ethical concerns for human safety. Therefore, studies in animal models provide great opportunities to reveal links between early-life exposure to EDCs and related diseases. It has been shown that developmental exposure to EDCs, such as diethylstilbestrol (DES) and genistein, during reproductive tract development increases the incidence, multiplicity and overall size of uterine fibroids in the Eker rat model, concomitantly reprogramming estrogen-responsive gene expression. Importantly, EDC exposure represses enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2) and reduces levels of the histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) repressive mark through Estrogen receptor / Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases / Protein kinase B non-genomic signaling in the developing uterus. More recent research identified a developmental reprogramming target, Scbg2a1 gene, whose epigenetic status can be altered by early exposure to BPA in the rat prostate. Molecular analyses revealed markedly increased expression (greater than 100 fold) of Scgb2a1, a secretaglobin gene in response to developmental exposure to BPA. This increase in Scgb2a1 expression is concomitantly associated with increased enrichment of acetylated H3K9 (H3K9Ac representing active chromatin status) and hypomethylation of DNA for a CpG island upstream of the transcription start site of Scgb2a1. These data suggest that expression of Scgb2a1 in the adult prostate could be epigenetically reprogrammed by BPA exposure during prostate development. Further studies are needed to create more targeted preventative interventions as well as specific, effective therapeutics to decrease the incidence of diseases.",PMC4966680

However, thyroid hormones are crucial for fetal development during the first trimester. We aimed to clarify the effect of phthalate exposure on thyroid hormones during early pregnancy. We recruited 97 pregnant women who were offered an amniocentesis during the early trimester from an obstetrics clinic in southern Taiwan from 2013 to 2014. After signing an informed consent form, we collected amniotic fluid and urine samples from pregnant women to analyze 11 metabolites, including mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono-butyl phthalate (MnBP), of 9 phthalates using liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. We collected blood samples from each subject to analyze serum thyroid hormones including thyroxine (T4), free T4, and thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). Three phthalate metabolites were discovered to be >80% in the urine samples of the pregnant women: MEP (88%), MnBP (81%) and MECPP (86%). Median MnBP and MECPP levels in pregnant Taiwanese women were 21.5 and 17.6 μg/g-creatinine, respectively, that decreased after the 2011 Taiwan DEHP scandal. Results of principal component analysis suggested two major sources (DEHP and other phthalates) of phthalates exposure in pregnant women.

The methylation status of 7 (Pitx3, Wnt10b, Paqr4, Sox2, Chst14, Tpd52, Creb3l4) of these 15 genes exhibited an inverse correlation with gene expression in tissue samples. Cell-based assays, using 5-aza-cytidine-treated normal (NbE-1) and cancerous (AIT) rat prostate cells, added evidence of DNA methylation-mediated gene expression of 6 genes (exception: Paqr4).

To date however animal studies to investigate a direct causal have mainly focussed on supra-environmental BPA concentrations, without investigating the effect on the early embryo. In this study we investigated the effect of acute BPA exposure (days 3.5 to 7.5 post-fertilisation) at environmentally relevant concentrations (1 and 10 ng/mL) on in vitro bovine embryo development, quality and metabolism. We then examined whether culturing embryos in the presence of the oestrogen receptor inhibitor fulvestrant could negate effects of BPA and 17β-oestradiol (E2). Exposure to BPA or E2 (10 ng/mL) decreased blastocyst rate and the percentage of transferrable quality embryos, without affecting cell number, lineage allocation or metabolic gene expression compared to untreated embryos. Notably, blastocysts exposed to BPA and E2 (10 ng/mL) displayed an increase in glucose consumption. The presence of fulvestrant however negated the adverse developmental and metabolic effects, suggesting BPA elicits its effects via oestrogen-mediated pathways. This study demonstrates that even acute exposure to an environmentally relevant BPA concentration can affect early embryo development and metabolism.

However, exactly how BPA affects offspring fertility remains poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of gestational BPA exposure on sperm function, fertility, and proteome profile of F1 spermatozoa in adult mice. Pregnant CD-1 mice (F0) were gavaged with BPA at three different doses (50 μg/kg bw/day, 5 mg/kg bw/day, and 50 mg/kg bw/day) on embryonic days 7 to 14. We investigated the function, fertility, and related processes of F1 spermatozoa at postnatal day 120. We also evaluated protein profiles of F1 spermatozoa to monitor their functional affiliation to disease. BPA inhibited sperm count, motility parameters, and intracellular ATP levels in a dose-dependent manner. These effects appeared to be caused by reduced numbers of stage VIII seminiferous epithelial cells in testis and decreased protein kinase A (PKA) activity and tyrosine phosphorylation in spermatozoa. We also found that BPA compromised average litter size. Proteins differentially expressed in spermatozoa from BPA treatment groups are known to play a critical role in ATP generation, oxidative stress response, fertility, and in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Our study provides mechanistic support for the hypothesis that gestational exposure to BPA alters sperm function and fertility via down-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation through a PKA-dependent mechanism. In addition, we anticipate that the BPA-induced changes in the sperm proteome might be partly responsible for the observed effects in spermatozoa.

A dose-dependent increase in hepatic tumors in 10-month mice perinatally exposed to one of three doses of BPA (50 ng, 50 µg, or 50 mg BPA/kg chow) was previously reported. These tumors represent early-onset disease and lack classical sexual dimorphism in incidence. Here, adult epigenome-wide liver DNA methylation profiles to identify gene promoters associated with perinatal BPA exposure and disease in 10-month mice with and without liver tumors were investigated. Mice with hepatic tumors showed 12,822 (1.8%) probes with differential methylation as compared with non-tumor animals, of which 8,656 (67.5%) were hypomethylated. A significant enrichment of differential methylation in Gene Ontology (GO) terms and biological processes related to morphogenesis and development, and epigenomic alteration were observed. Pathway enrichment revealed a predominance of hypermethylated neuronal signaling pathways linked to energy regulation and metabolic function, supporting metabolic consequences in the liver via BPA-induced disruption of neuronal signaling pathways.

This study investigates the relationship between maternal exposure to common plasticizers in pregnancy and fetal growth. Participants from a longitudinal birth cohort in Boston were recruited early in gestation and followed until delivery. Urine samples were collected at up to four time points and analyzed for concentrations of phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A (BPA). Ultrasound scans were performed at four time points during pregnancy for estimation of growth parameters, and birthweight was recorded at delivery. Growth measures were standardized to a larger population. For the present analysis we examined cross-sectional and repeated measures associations between exposure biomarkers and growth estimates in 482 non-anomalous singleton pregnancies. Cross-sectional associations between urinary phthalate metabolites or BPA and growth indices were imprecise. However, in repeated measures models, we observed significant inverse associations between di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites and estimated or actual fetal weight. An interquartile range increase in summed DEHP metabolites was associated with a 0.13 standard deviation decrease in estimated or actual fetal weight (95% confidence interval=-0.23, -0.03). Associations were consistent across different growth parameters (e.g., head circumference, femur length), and by fetal sex. No consistent associations were observed for other phthalate metabolites or BPA. Maternal exposure to DEHP during pregnancy was associated with decreased fetal growth, which could have repercussive effects.",PMC4980186

Few studies have been performed to investigate this association among children. In this study, we prospectively examined the relationship between the serum concentration of POPs and glucose metabolism in children. Data were collected from the Ewha Birth & Growth Cohort Study, an ongoing birth cohort study initially constructed between 2001 and 2006. In 2010-2012, the POP concentration was measured in serum from a total of 214 children, 7-9 years of age. Using fasting glucose and insulin measurements at both baseline and the second year of follow-up, the homeostatic model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-β) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated. Multiple linear regression analysis and a linear mixed-effects model were used to determine the relationship between POP tertiles and metabolic biomarkers. Compared with the lowest tertile of total marker PCBs, participants in the third tertile had decreased HOMA-β values, after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index z-score, mother's education, ponderal index, and history of breastfeeding (-18.94%; 95% CI: -32.97%, -1.98%). In a linear mixed model, the HOMA-β values were still lower in subjects in the highest compared with the lowest tertile of total PCBs at the 2-year follow-up period (108.3 vs. 135.0, respectively). The results of the study suggested that exposure to POPs among children might affect insulin secretory function, which could lead to an increased risk of developing diabetes.

Current practices emphasize the use of concentration addition to predict joint effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals in coexposures. Generalized concentration addition (GCA) is one such method for predicting joint effects of coexposures to chemicals and has the advantage of allowing for mixture components to have differences in efficacy (ie, dose-response curve maxima). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor that plays a central role in regulating lipid homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and bone quality and is the target of an increasing number of environmental toxicants. Here, we tested the applicability of GCA in predicting mixture effects of therapeutic (rosiglitazone and nonthiazolidinedione partial agonist) and environmental PPARγ ligands (phthalate compounds identified using EPA's ToxCast database). Transcriptional activation of human PPARγ1 by individual compounds and mixtures was assessed using a peroxisome proliferator response element-driven luciferase reporter. Using individual dose-response parameters and GCA, we generated predictions of PPARγ activation by the mixtures, and we compared these predictions with the empirical data. At high concentrations, GCA provided a better estimation of the experimental response compared with 3 alternative models: toxic equivalency factor, effect summation and independent action. These alternatives provided reasonable fits to the data at low concentrations in this system. These experiments support the implementation of GCA in mixtures analysis with endocrine disrupting compounds and establish PPARγ as an important target for further studies of chemical mixtures.",PMC5013877

Arsenic, copper, lead, manganese and thallium were measured in cord blood, cadmium in maternal blood, methylmercury in maternal hair, and five organochlorines, two perfluorinated compounds and diethylhexyl phthalate metabolites in cord plasma. Daily exposure to particulate matter was modeled and averaged over the duration of gestation. In single pollutant models, arsenic was significantly associated with reduced birth weight. The effect estimate increased when including cadmium, and mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) co-exposure. Combining exposures by principal component analysis generated an exposure factor loaded by cadmium and arsenic that was associated with reduced birth weight. MECPP induced gender specific effects. In girls, the effect estimate was doubled with co-exposure of thallium, PFOS, lead, cadmium, manganese, and mercury, while in boys, the mixture of MECPP with cadmium showed the strongest association with birth weight.

Reports have shown that TCS is a potential endocrine disruptor; however, the potential effects of TCS on placental endocrine function are unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the endocrine disrupting effects of TCS on the placenta in pregnant rats. Pregnant rats from gestational day (GD) 6 to GD 20 were treated with 0, 30, 100, 300 and 600 mg/kg/d TCS followed by analysis of various biochemical parameters. Of the seven tissues examined, the greatest bioaccumulation of TCS was observed in the placenta. Reduction of gravid uterine weight and the occurrence of abortion were observed in the 600 mg/kg/d TCS-exposed group. Moreover, hormone detection demonstrated that the serum levels of progesterone (P), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and prolactin (PRL) were decreased in groups exposed to higher doses of TCS. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) analysis revealed a significant increase in mRNA levels for placental steroid metabolism enzymes, including UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), estrogen sulfotransferase 1E1 (SULT1E1), steroid 5α-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) and steroid 5α-reductase 2 (SRD5A2). Furthermore, the transcriptional expression levels of progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor (ERα) and androgen receptor (AR) were up-regulated.

A total priority index was calculated from the product of the toxicity and exposure scores. The three highest priority chemicals were formaldehyde, dibutyl phthalate and styrene. Elements of the framework were compared to existing prioritization tools, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ExpoCast and Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi).

In this study, we investigated the effects of BPA exposure on porcine oocyte maturation and its possible reasons. Our results showed that: (i) the rates of oocyte maturation significantly decreased with 250 μM BPA treatment in vitro, but not DEHP. This might be due to the delayed cell cycle progression of oocyte maturation. (ii) BPA treatment resulted in abnormal cytoskeletons on porcine oocytes, showing with aberrant actin distribution, spindle morphology and chromosome alignment, which was further confirmed by the reduced p-MAPK level. (iii) The fluorescence intensity of histone methylation (H3K4me2) and DNA methylation (5 mC) levels were altered after BPA treatment, indicating that epigenetic modification was disturbed.

This study investigated the role of the testicular orphan nuclear receptor4 (TR4)/Bcl-2 pathway in apoptosis induced by DEHP, which resulted in reproductive damage. To elucidate the mechanism underpinning the male reproductive toxicity of DEHP, we sought to investigate apoptotic effects, expression levels of TR4/Bcl-2 pathway in GC-2spd cells, including TR4, Bcl-2 and caspase-3. GC-2spd cells were exposed to various concentrations of DEHP (0, 50, 100, or 200μM). The results indicated that, with the increase of the concentrations of DEHP, the survival rate of cell decreased gradually. DEHP exposure at over 100μM significantly induced apoptotic cell death. DEHP decreased SOD and GSH-Px activity in 200μM group. Compared to the control group, the mRNA levels of caspase-3 increased significantly, however, Bcl-2 mRNA decreased (P<0.05). In addition, there was a significant reduction in TR4, Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 protein levels.

We found universal and high exposure to uBPA and its metabolites: median concentrations were 0.25, 4.67, and 0.31 μg/g creatinine for uBPA, BPA glucuronide, and BPA sulfate, respectively. The median Total BPA (uBPA + BPA in glucuronide and sulfate forms) level was more than twice that measured in U.S. pregnant women in NHANES 2005-2006, while 30 % of the women had Total BPA levels above the 95th percentile. On average, Total BPA consisted of 71 % BPA in glucuronide form, 15 % BPA in sulfate form and 14 % uBPA, however the proportion of BPA in sulfate form increased and the proportion of uBPA decreased with Total BPA levels. Occupational and non-occupational contact with paper receipts was positively associated with BPA in conjugated (glucuronidated + sulfated) form after adjustment for demographic characteristics. Recent consumption of foods and beverages likely to be contaminated with BPA was infrequent among participants and we did not observe any positive associations with BPA analyte levels. The high levels of BPA analytes found in our study population may be attributable to the low-income status of the majority of participants and/or our direct analytic method, which yields a more complete evaluation of BPA exposure. We observed near-universal exposure to BPA among pregnant women, as well as substantial variability in BPA metabolic clearance, raising additional concerns for effects on fetal development.

The model includes cellular proliferation, intracellular cholesterol translocation, diffusional transport of steroids, and metabolic pathways of adrenal steroidogenesis, which serially involve steroidogenic proteins and enzymes such as StAR, CYP11A1, CYP17A1, HSD3B2, CYP21A2, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, HSD17B3, and CYP19A1. It was reconstructed in an experimental dynamics of cholesterol and 14 steroids from an in vitro steroidogenesis assay using NCI-H295R cells. Results of dynamic sensitivity analysis suggested that HSD3B2 plays the most important role in the metabolic balance of adrenal steroidogenesis. Based on differential metabolic profiling of 12 steroid hormones and 11 adrenal toxic compounds, we could estimate which steroidogenic enzymes were affected in this mathematical model.

One of the mechanisms of endocrine disruption is through binding of endocrine disruptors with the hormone receptors in the target cells. Entrance of endocrine disruptors into target cells is the precondition of endocrine disruption. The binding capability of a chemical with proteins in the blood affects its entrance into the target cells and, thus, is very informative for the assessment of potential endocrine disruption of chemicals. α-fetoprotein is one of the major serum proteins that binds to a variety of chemicals such as estrogens. To better facilitate assessment of endocrine disruption of environmental chemicals, we developed a model for α-fetoprotein binding activity prediction using the novel pattern recognition method (Decision Forest) and the molecular descriptors calculated from two-dimensional structures by Mold² software. The predictive capability of the model has been evaluated through internal validation using 125 training chemicals (average balanced accuracy of 69%) and external validations using 22 chemicals (balanced accuracy of 71%).

BPA is considered a metabolic disruptor, affecting different organs; however, little is known about its mechanism of action in the liver, in which it triggers triglyceride accumulation. Adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to BPA developed hepatosteatosis, which was associated with an increase in the liver levels of the obesogenic endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol and anandamide and a concomitant decrease in palmitoylethanolamide. These changes were associated with variations in the expression of key endocannabinoid catabolic and metabolic enzymes and an increase in the expression of the endocannabinoid receptor cnr1. Acute and chronic in vitro treatments with nano- and micromolar BPA doses showed increased anandamide levels in line with decreased activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase, the main anandamide hydrolytic enzyme, and induced triglyceride accumulation in HHL-5 cells in a CB1-dependent manner. We conclude that BPA is able to produce hepatosteatosis in zebrafish and human hepatocytes by up-regulating the endocannabinoid system.",PMC6285285

To calculate the associated combined health care and economic costs attributable to specific EDC exposures within the European Union (EU). An expert panel evaluated evidence for probability of causation using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change weight-of-evidence characterization. Exposure-response relationships and reference levels were evaluated, and biomarker data were organized from carefully identified studies from the peer-reviewed literature to represent European exposure and approximate burden of disease as it occurred in 2010. Cost-of-illness estimation used multiple peer-reviewed sources. Cost estimation was carried out from a societal perspective, ie, including direct costs (eg, treatment costs) and indirect costs such as productivity loss. The most robust EDC-related data for female reproductive disorders exist for 1) diphenyldichloroethene-attributable fibroids and 2) phthalate-attributable endometriosis in Europe. In both cases, the strength of epidemiological evidence was rated as low and the toxicological evidence as moderate, with an assigned probability of causation of 20%–39%. Across the EU, attributable cases were estimated to be 56 700 and 145 000 women, respectively, with total combined economic and health care costs potentially reaching €163 million and €1.25 billion. EDCs (diphenyldichloroethene and phthalates) may contribute substantially to the most common reproductive disorders in women, endometriosis and fibroids, costing nearly €1.5 billion annually. These estimates represent only EDCs for which there were sufficient epidemiologic studies and those with the highest probability of causation. These public health costs should be considered as the EU contemplates regulatory action on EDCs.",PMC4880176

The recombined yeast estrogen screen (YES) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were applied to assess the estrogenicity and detect the estrogens in the samples. The estrogen equivalents (EEQs) ranged from nd (not detected) to 2.96 ng/L, and the estrogenic activities decreased along the processes. Among the 32 samples, DES prevailed in all samples, with concentrations ranging 1.46-12.0 ng/L, BPA, OP and NP were partially detected, with concentrations ranging from nd to 17.73 ng/L, nd to 0.49 ng/L and nd to 3.27 ng/L, respectively. DES was found to be the main contributor to the estrogenicity (99.06%), followed by NP (0.62%), OP (0.23%) and BPA (0.09%). From the observation of treatment efficiency, the advanced treatment processes presented much higher removal ratio in reducing DES, the biodegradation played an important role in removing BPA, ozonation and pre-oxidation showed an effective removal on all the four estrogens; while the conventional ones can also reduce all the four estrogens.",PMC4782170

Our aim was to examine whether prolonged exposure to low doses of BPA could affect adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolic functions. Therefore, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured for three weeks with BPA 1 nM to mimic human environmental exposure. We evaluated BPA effect on cell proliferation, differentiation, gene expression and adipocyte metabolic function. BPA significantly increased pre-adipocyte proliferation (p<0.01). In 3T3-L1 adipocytes differentiated in the presence of BPA, the expression of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4/Adipocyte Protein 2 (FABP4/AP2) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPα) was increased by 3.5, 1.5 and 3 folds, respectively. Mature adipocytes also showed a significant increase in lipid accumulation (p<0.05) and alterations of insulin action, with significant reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose utilization (p<0.001). Moreover, in mature adipocytes, mRNA levels of Leptin, interleukin-6 (IL6) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) were significantly increased (p<0.05). In conclusion, BPA prolonged exposure at low doses, consistent with those found in the environment, may affect adipocyte differentiation program, enhancing pre-adipocyte proliferation and anticipating the expression of the master genes involved in lipid/glucose metabolism. The resulting adipocytes are hypertrophic, with impaired insulin signaling, reduced glucose utilization and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Thus, these data supported the hypothesis that BPA exposure, during critical stages of adipose tissue development, may cause adipocyte metabolic dysfunction and inflammation, thereby increasing the risk of developing obesity-related diseases.",PMC4778877

Therefore, as part of a prospective cohort study, 214 children were measured for POPs exposure. After the 1-year follow-up, we assessed the effect of circulating POPs exposure among 158 children aged 7-9 years (at baseline) on the change of metabolic components of metabolic syndrome using multiple regression analysis. In addition, we calculated the continuous metabolic syndrome (cMetS) score and assessed the variation among individuals by POPs exposure. The concentrations of marker polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were significantly associated with increased change in diastolic blood pressure (BP) and triglyceride levels during a 1-year follow-up, after controlling for sex, age, household income, and change in body mass index. Total PCBs also showed a marginal association with increasing cMetS score from the baseline. Of the metabolic components, change in diastolic BP over time showed a notable association with specific PCBs, but no association with organochlorine pesticides. Here, we found that low-dose exposures to PCBs among children in the general population could negatively influence metabolic health, particularly diastolic BP. Increased disease sensitivity during childhood can continue to adulthood, thus, these results support the need for continuous assessment of the health impact of POPs.",PMC4808933

Bisphenol A (BPA), an environmental pollutant with estrogenic actions, can disrupt this feedback and lead to infertility in both humans and animals. GnRH neurons are essential for reproduction, serving as an important link between brain, pituitary, and gonads. Because GnRH neurons express several receptors that bind estrogen, they are potential targets for endocrine disruptors. However, to date, direct effects of BPA on GnRH neurons have not been shown. This study investigated the effects of BPA on GnRH neuronal activity using an explant model in which large numbers of primary GnRH neurons are maintained and express many of the receptors found in vivo. Because oscillations in intracellular calcium have been shown to correlate with electrical activity in GnRH neurons, calcium imaging was used to assay the effects of BPA. Exposure to 50μM BPA significantly decreased GnRH calcium activity. Blockage of γ-aminobutyric acid ergic and glutamatergic input did not abrogate the inhibitory BPA effect, suggesting direct regulation of GnRH neurons by BPA. In addition to estrogen receptor-β, single-cell RT-PCR analysis confirmed that GnRH neurons express G protein-coupled receptor 30 (G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1) and estrogen-related receptor-γ, all potential targets for BPA. Perturbation studies of the signaling pathway revealed that the BPA-mediated inhibition of GnRH neuronal activity occurred independent of estrogen receptors, GPER, or estrogen-related receptor-γ, via a noncanonical pathway. These results provide the first evidence of a direct effect of BPA on GnRH neurons.",PMC4870872

BPA exposure in utero has been linked to breast cancer and abnormal mammary gland development in mice. The recent rise in incidence of human breast cancer and decreased age of first detection suggests a possible environmental etiology. We hypothesized that developmental programming of carcinogenesis may involve an aberrant immune response. Both innate and adaptive immunity play a role in tumor suppression through cytolytic CD8, NK, and Th1 T-cells. We hypothesized that BPA exposure in utero would lead to dysregulation of both innate and adaptive immunity in the mammary gland. CD1 mice were exposed to BPA in utero during gestation (days 9-21) via osmotic minipump. At 6 weeks, the female offspring were ovariectomized and estradiol was given at 8 weeks. RNA and protein were extracted from the posterior mammary glands, and the mRNA and protein levels were measured by PCR array, qRT-PCR, and western blot. In mouse mammary tissue, BPA exposure in utero significantly decreased the expression of members of the chemokine CXC family (Cxcl2, Cxcl4, Cxcl14, and Ccl20), interleukin 1 (Il1) gene family (Il1β and Il1rn), interleukin 2 gene family (Il7 receptor), and interferon gene family (interferon regulatory factor 9 (Irf9), as well as immune response gene 1 (Irg1). Additionally, BPA exposure in utero decreased Esr1 receptor gene expression and increased Esr2 receptor gene expression. In utero exposure of BPA resulted in significant changes to inflammatory modulators within mammary tissue. We suggest that dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory, leads to a microenvironment that may promote disordered cell growth through inhibition of the immune response that targets cancer cells.",PMC10726733

Effects on oocyte growth and maturation, autophagy and apoptosis processes, histone modifications, and DNA methylation were assessed by Real-Time PCR (qPCR), histology, and chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with qPCR analysis (ChIP-qPCR). The results showed that 5 μg/L BPA down-regulated oocyte maturation-promoting signals, likely through changes in the chromatin structure mediated by histone modifications, and promoted apoptosis in mature follicles.

Mouse dams were treated with 500 mg·kg·d of BBP or vehicle on gestation days 9-16. Pups were weaned and analyzed for voluntary physical activity levels, puberty development, sex hormone levels, and body composition during the 20-wk period. Seventy-three offspring from BBP-treated dams were studied (n = 43 males and n = 30 females). Endocrine disruption was indicated by decreased anogenital distances in BBP-treated male offspring at 10 (P = 0.001) and 20 wk (P = 0.038) and delayed vaginal openings in BBP-treated female offspring (P = 0.001). Further, there was a significant decrease in serum testosterone concentration in male mice between control and BBP at 10 wk (P = 0.039) and at 20 wk (P = 0.022). In female mice, there was a significant increase in serum testosterone concentration in BBP mice at 20 wk (P = 0.002) and a significant increase in estrogen (estradiol) concentrations at 20 wk in the control female mice (P = 0.015). Overall, BBP mice ran significantly less distance (males, P = 0.008; females, P = 0.042) than controls. Other than a significant increase in BBP-treated males in fat mass at 20 wk (P = 0.040), there was no significant decrease in weight, lean mass, or fat mass in either female or male mice, regardless of treatment. Maternal endocrine disruption altered hormone response, but not body composition in either sex of offspring, with a corresponding decreased activity throughout early adulthood in all offspring.

The widespread use of SPs has resulted in the increased exposure to wild animals and humans. Recently, some SPs are suspected as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and have been assessed for their potential estrogenicity by adopting various analyzing assays. In this study, we examined the estrogenic effects of lambda-cyhalothrin (LC) and cypermethrin (CP), the most commonly used pesticides in Korea, using BG-1 ovarian cancer cells expressing estrogen receptors (ERs). To evaluate the estrogenic activities of two SPs, LC and CP, we employed MTT assay and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in LC or CP treated BG-1 ovarian cancer cells. In MTT assay, LC (10(-6) M) and CP (10(-5) M) significantly induced the growth of BG-1 cancer cells. LC or CP-induced cell growth was antagonized by addition of ICI 182,720 (10(-8) M), an ER antagonist, suggesting that this effect appears to be mediated by an ER-dependent manner. Moreover, RT-PCR results showed that transcriptional level of cyclin D1, a cell cycle-regulating gene, was significantly up-regulated by LC and CP, while these effects were reversed by co-treatment of ICI 182,780. However, p21, a cyclin D-ckd-4 inhibitor gene, was not altered by LC or CP. Moreover, ERα expression was not significantly changed by LC and CP, while downregulated by E2. Finally, in xenografted mouse model transplanted with human BG-1 ovarian cancer cells, E2 significantly increased the tumor volume compare to a negative control, but LC did not. Taken together, these results suggest that LC and CP may possess estrogenic potentials by stimulating the growth of BG-1 ovarian cancer cells via partially ER signaling pathway associated with cell cycle as did E2, but this estrogenic effect was not found in in vivo mouse model.",PMC4751442

The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of neonatal BPA exposure on the first wave of spermatogenesis. Newborn male mice were subcutaneously injected with BPA (0.01, 0.1 and 5 mg/kg body weight) daily from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 21. Histological analysis of testes at PND 22 revealed that BPA-treated testes contained mostly spermatogonia and spermatocytes with markedly less round spermatids, indicating signs of meiotic arrest. Terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that BPA treatment significantly increased the number of apoptotic germ cells per tubule, which corroborated the observation of meiotic arrest. In addition, BPA caused abnormal proliferation of germ cells as revealed by Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemical staining. Mechanistically, BPA-treated testes displayed a complete lack of BOULE expression, which is a conserved key regulator for spermatogenesis. Moreover, BPA significantly increased the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) α and β in the developing testis.

As an environmental endocrine disruptor, it has been shown to be harmful to the mammalian reproductive system. Previous studies indicated that DEHP inhibited the development of mouse ovarian follicles. However, the mechanisms by which DEHP affects ovarian antral follicle development during the pre-puberty stage are poorly understand. Thus, we investigated the effects of direct DEHP exposure on antral follicle growth in pre-pubescent mice by use of intraperitoneal injection. Our results demonstrated that the percentage of large antral follicles was significantly reduced when mice were exposed to 20 or 40 μg/kg DEHP every 5 days from postnatal day 0 (0 dpp) to 15 dpp. In 20 dpp, we performed microarray of these ovaries. The microarray results indicated that mRNA levels of apoptosis related genes were increased. The mRNA levels of the apoptosis and cell proliferation (negative) related genes Apoe, Agt, Glo1 and Grina were increased after DEHP exposure. DEHP induced the differential gene expression of Hsp90ab1, Rhoa, Grina and Xdh which may play an important role in this process. In addition, TUNEL staining and immunofluorescence showed that DEHP exposure significantly increased the number of TUNEL, Caspase3 and γH2AX positive ovarian somatic cells within the mouse ovaries. Flow cytometer analyses of redox-sensitive probes showed that DEHP caused the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, the mRNA expression of ovarian somatic cell antioxidative enzymes was down-regulated both in vivo and in vitro.

BeWo cells were exposed to BPA and co-cultured with human endometrial cells to mimic embryo implantation in transwell model. The proliferation and invasion capability of BeWo cells were detected. The expression of E-cadherin, DNMT1, MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were also analyzed. The results showed that the invasion capability of BeWo was reduced after daily exposure to BPA. BPA had biphasic effect on E-cadherin expression level in BeWo cells and expression level of DNMT1 was decreased when treated with BPA. Moreover, BPA treatment also changed the balance of MMPs/TIMPs in BeWo cells by down-regulating MMP-2, MMP-9 and up-regulating TIMP-1, TIMP-2 with increasing BPA concentration. Taken together, these results showed that BPA treatment could reduce the invasion ability of BeWo cells and alter the expression level of E-cadherin, DNMT1, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9.

Many studies indicate that high-doses of DBP and/or MBP exhibit toxicity on testicular function, however, little attention have been paid to the effects of low levels of DBP/MBP on steroidogenesis. As we all know, the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is a key regulator involved in the steroidogenesis. Here we found that, in addition to StAR, MBP/DBP increased the steroidogenesis by a cytoskeletal protein, vimentin. Briefly, in murine adrenocortical tumor (Y1) and the mouse Leydig tumor (MLTC-1) cells, vimentin regulated the secretion of progesterone. When these two cells were exposure to MBP, the DNA demethylation in the vimentin promoter was observed. In addition, MBP also induced the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB, a transcriptional regulator of vimentin). These two processes improved the transcriptional elevation of vimentin. Knockdown of NF-κB/vimentin signaling blocked the DBP/MBP-induced steroidogenesis. These in vitro results were also confirmed via an in vivo model.

Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been shown to induce atherosclerosis by increasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) productions.

The main objective of the study was to measure the presence of these environmental chemicals in prepubescent children and assess the relationship between chemical metabolites and estrogen metabolism. 50 subjects (25 male, 25 female) were recruited from the principal investigator's existing patient population at his pediatric primary care office. The first 5 boys and 5 girls in each age group (4 through 8 years old inclusive) who presented for annual examinations were included, as long as they were Tanner Stage I (prepubertal) on physical exam, without diagnosis of hormonally-related condition and/or cancer and able to give a urine sample. Urine samples were collected in glass containers for analysis of chemical and estrogen metabolites. Study kits and lab analysis were provided by Genova Diagnostics (Duluth, GA). Summary statistics for the concentrations of each chemical metabolite as well as estrogen metabolites were computed (minimum, maximum, median and inter-quartile range) for males only, for females only and for all subjects. Comparisons between groups (e.g. males v. females) were assessed using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test, since the data was skewed. The correlation between concentrations of chemical metabolites and estrogen metabolites in prepubescent children were examined by the Spearman's correlation coefficient (ρ). 100 % of subjects had detectable levels of at least five chemicals [corrected] in their urine, and 74 % had detectable levels of eight or more chemicals. 28 % of subjects had measurable levels of 4NP.

In this study, BPA and phytoestrogens in urine specimens (n = 256) collected from children in China were measured by liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). BPA was detected in most specimens, with a geometric mean concentration of 1.58 ng/mL. For the first time, levels of urinary phytoestrogens in Chinese children were reported. Daidzein and enterolactone are the typical isoflavones and lignans compounds in urine, respectively. Relatively high levels of urinary BPA indicate an increasing risk of BPA exposure to Chinese children. Urinary concentrations of daidzein in Chinese children are higher when compared with those reported in the U.S. children, while concentrations of urinary enterolactone and enterodiols are significantly lower. This suggests a significant difference in phytoestrogen intake between the children from China and from the U.S.",PMC4690900

These chemicals target the neuroendocrine system which is composed of organs throughout the body that work alongside the central nervous system to regulate biological processes. Of primary importance is the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis which is vital for maintaining proper reproductive function. Atrazine (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5-triazine) is a pre-emergent herbicide used to prevent the growth of weeds on various crops. This herbicide is reported to widely contaminate potable water supplies everywhere it is applied. As such, the European Union banned the use of atrazine in 2004. Currently the United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates atrazine at 3 parts per billion (ppb; μg/L) in drinking water, while the World Health Organization recently changed their drinking water guideline to 100 ppb. Atrazine is implicated to be an EDC that alters reproductive dysfunction by targeting the HPG axis. However, questions remain as to the human health risks associated with atrazine exposure with studies reporting mixed results on the ability of atrazine to alter the HPG axis. In this review, the current findings for atrazine's effects on the HPG axis are examined in mammalian, anuran, and fish models and in epidemiological studies.",PMC5507375

Reports of CPAs, which include hypospadias, chordee, micropenis, and ambiguous genitalia, have risen sharply in recent decades, but the causes of these malformations are rarely identified. Both genetic anomalies and environmental factors, such as antiandrogenic and estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are suspected to cause CPAs; however, little is known about the temporal window(s) of sensitivity to EDCs, or the tissue-specific roles and downstream targets of the androgen receptor (AR) in external genitalia. Here, we show that the full spectrum of CPAs can be produced by disrupting AR at different developmental stages and in specific cell types in the mouse genital tubercle. Inactivation of AR during a narrow window of prenatal development results in hypospadias and chordee, whereas earlier disruptions cause ambiguous genitalia and later disruptions cause micropenis. The neonatal phase of penile development is controlled by the balance of AR to estrogen receptor α (ERα) activity; either inhibition of androgen or augmentation of estrogen signaling can induce micropenis. AR and ERα have opposite effects on cell division, apoptosis, and regulation of Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein, and Wnt signaling in the genital tubercle. We identify Indian hedgehog (Ihh) as a novel downstream target of AR in external genitalia and show that conditional deletion of Ihh inhibits penile masculinization. These studies reveal previously unidentified cellular and molecular mechanisms by which antiandrogenic and estrogenic signals induce penile malformations and demonstrate that the timing of endocrine disruption can determine the type of CPA.",PMC4703017

The brain is particularly vulnerable to EDCs during critical periods of gestational development when gonadal hormones exert organizational effects on sexually dimorphic behaviors later in life. Peripubertal development is also a time of continued neural sensitivity to organizing effects of hormones, yet little is known about EDC actions at these times. We sought to determine effects of prenatal or juvenile exposures to a class of EDCs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at human-relevant dosages on development, physiology, and social and anxiety-related behaviors later in life, and the consequences of a second juvenile ""hit"" following prenatal treatment. We exposed male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to PCBs (Aroclor 1221, 1mg/kg/day, ip injection) and/or vehicle during prenatal development (embryonic days 16, 18, 20), juvenile development (postnatal days 24, 26, 28), or both. These exposures had differential effects on behaviors in sex and age-dependent ways; while prenatal exposure had more effects than juvenile, juvenile exposure often modified or unmasked the effects of the first hit. Additionally, females exhibited altered social and anxiety behavior in adolescence, while males displayed small but significant changes in sociosexual preferences in adulthood. Thus, the brain continues to be sensitive to organizing effects of EDCs through juvenile development. As humans are exposed to EDCs throughout multiple periods in their life, these findings have implications for our understanding of EDC effects on physiology and behavior.",PMC4718783

Additionally, DNA methylation profiles were analyzed at human homologs of murine candidate genes in human fetal liver samples (n = 50) with known liver tissue BPA levels. Candidate genes were chosen based on reported expression changes in both rodent and human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Regions for bisulfite sequencing were chosen by mining whole genome next generation sequencing methylation datasets of both mice and human liver samples with known perinatal BPA exposures. One of 3 candidate genes, Stat3, displayed dose-dependent DNA methylation changes in both 10-month mice with liver tumors as compared to those without liver tumors and 3-week sibling mice from the same exposure study, implicating Stat3 as a potential epigenetic biomarker of both early life BPA exposure and adult disease in mice. DNA methylation profiles within STAT3 varied with liver tissue BPA level in human fetal liver samples as well, suggesting STAT3 may be a translationally relevant candidate biomarker.

First morning urine samples were collected for the determination of urinary BPA, creatinine, and urinary iodine concentrations (UIC). Thyroid volume (TV) and nodules were assessed by thyroid ultrasonography. The median of TV was 3.14ml. 459(63.9%) children took iodized salt at home and the median of UIC was 159μg/l.

Circulating T levels were maintained within the physiological range in all treatment groups, whereas the levels of free BPA were elevated in the groups treated with T+low BPA (1.06 ± 0.05 ng/mL, P < .05) and T+high BPA (10.37 ± 0.43 ng/mL, P < .01) when compared with those in both controls (0.1 ± 0.05 ng/mL). Prostatic hyperplasia, low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), and marked infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into the PIN epithelium (P < .05) were observed in the lateral prostates (LPs) of T+low/high BPA-treated rats. In contrast, only hyperplasia and high-grade PIN, but no aberrant immune responses, were found in the T+E2-treated LPs. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in LPs identified differential changes between T+BPA vs T+E2 treatment. Expression of multiple genes in the regulatory network controlled by hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α was perturbed by the T+BPA but not by the T+E2 exposure. Collectively these findings suggest that the adult rat prostate, under a physiologically relevant T environment, is susceptible to BPA-induced transcriptomic reprogramming, immune disruption, and aberrant growth dysregulation in a manner distinct from those caused by E2.

We investigated nongenomic estrogenic effects of low concentrations of BPA and three related alkylphenols on the inhibition of zebrafish oocye maturation (OM) mediated through a G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (Gper)-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway. BPA (10-100 nM) treatment for 3 h mimicked the effects of estradiol-17beta (E2) and EGF, decreasing spontaneous maturation of defolliculated zebrafish oocytes, an effect not blocked by coincubation with actinomycin D, but blocked by coincubation with a Gper antibody. BPA displayed relatively high binding affinity (15.8% that of E2) for recombinant zebrafish Gper. The inhibitory effects of BPA were attenuated by inhibition of upstream regulators of Egfr, intracellular tyrosine kinase (Src) with PP2, and matrix metalloproteinase with ilomastat. Treatment with an inhibitor of Egfr transactivation, AG1478, and an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 3/1 pathway, U0126, increased spontaneous OM and blocked the inhibitory effects of BPA, E2, and the selective GPER agonist, G-1. Western blot analysis showed that BPA (10-200 nM) mimicked the stimulatory effects of E2 and EGF on Mapk3/1 phosphorylation. Tetrabromobisphenol A, 4-nonylphenol, and tetrachlorobisphenol A (5-100 nM) also inhibited OM, an effect blocked by cotreatment with AG1478, as well as with the GPER antagonist, G-15, and displayed similar binding affinities as BPA to zebrafish Gper.

We examined the toxicogenomic profile of mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, the active metabolite of DEHP), the commercial plasticizer diisononyl cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH), and three recently proposed plasticizers: 1,4-butanediol dibenzoate (BDB), dioctyl succinate (DOS), and dioctyl maleate (DOM), using the immortalized TM4 Sertoli cell line. Results of gene expression studies revealed that DOS and BDB clustered with control samples while MEHP, DINCH and DOM were distributed far away from the control-DOS-BDB cluster, as determined by principle component analysis. While no significant changes in gene expression were found after treatment with BDB and DOS, treatment with MEHP, DINCH and DOM resulted in many differentially expressed genes. MEHP upregulated genes downstream of PPAR and targeted pathways of cholesterol biosynthesis without modulating the expression of PPAR's themselves. DOM upregulated genes involved in glutathione stress response, DNA repair, and cholesterol biosynthesis. Treatment with DINCH resulted in altered expression of a large number of genes involved in major signal transduction pathways including ERK/MAPK and Rho signalling.

Bisphenol A (BPA; 4,4'-(propane-2,2-diyl)diphenol) and 4-tert-octylphenol (OP; 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol) are among the most common environmental contaminants possessing endocrine disruption properties and are present in plastics, epoxy resins, detergents and other commercial products of common personal and industrial use. A metabolite of BPA, 4-Methyl-2,4-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)pent-1-ene (MBP) is about 1000 times more biologically active compared to BPA. Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental studies have shown association of BPA and OP with adverse effects on male and female reproductive system in human and animals. The endocrine disruption activity can occur through multiple pathways including binding to steroid receptors. Androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PR) are critical for reproductive tract growth and function. Structural binding characterization of BPA, MBP, and OP with AR and PR using molecular docking simulation approaches revealed novel interactions of BPA with PR, and MBP and OP with AR and PR. For BPA, MBP, and OP, five AR interacting residues Leu-701, Leu-704, Asn-705, Met-742, and Phe-764 overlapped with those of native AR ligand testosterone, and four PR interacting residues Leu-715, Leu-718, Met-756, and Met-759 overlapped with those of PR co-complex ligand, norethindrone. For both the receptors the binding strength of MBP was maximum among the three compounds. Thus, these compounds have the potential to block or interfere in the binding of the endogenous native AR and PR ligands and, hence, resulting in dysfunction.

Our goal was to describe the distribution of BPA concentrations in serial urinary specimens, assess temporal variability, and provide estimates of exposure classification when randomly selected samples are used to predict average exposure. We collected and analyzed 2,614 urine specimens from 83 Utah couples beginning in 2012. Female participants collected daily first-morning urine specimens during one to two menstrual cycles and male partners collected specimens during the woman's fertile window for each cycle. We measured urinary BPA concentrations and calculated geometric means (GM) for each cycle, characterized the distribution of observed values and temporal variability using intraclass correlation coefficients, and performed surrogate category analyses to determine how well repeat samples could classify exposure. The GM urine BPA concentration was 2.78 ng/mL among males and 2.44 ng/mL among females. BPA had a high degree of variability among both males (ICC = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.26) and females (ICC = 0.11; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.16). Based on our more stringent surrogate category analysis, to reach proportions ≥ 0.80 for sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) among females, 6 and 10 repeat samples for the high and low tertiles, respectively, were required. For the medium tertile, specificity reached 0.87 with 10 repeat samples, but even with 11 samples, sensitivity and PPV did not exceed 0.36.

Additionally, select maternal urinary metabolites were associated with decreased head circumference, birth length and gestational age. However, paternal concentrations were generally associated with increased birth length and gestational age.

The objectives of the current study were 2-fold: (1) to test whether a mixture model of dose addition based on the fetal T production data of individual phthalates would predict the effects of a 5 phthalate mixture on androgen-sensitive postnatal male reproductive tract development, and (2) to determine the biological relevance of the reductions in fetal T to induce abnormal postnatal reproductive tract development using data from the mixture study. We administered a dose range of the mixture (60, 40, 20, 10, and 5% of the top dose used in the previous fetal T production study consisting of 300 mg/kg per chemical of benzyl butyl (BBP), di(n)butyl (DBP), diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), and 100 mg dipentyl (DPP) phthalate/kg; the individual phthalates were present in equipotent doses based on their ability to reduce fetal T production) via gavage to Sprague Dawley rat dams on GD8-postnatal day 3. We compared observed mixture responses to predictions of dose addition based on the previously published potencies of the individual phthalates to reduce fetal T production relative to a reference chemical and published postnatal data for the reference chemical (called DAref). In addition, we predicted DA (called DAall) and response addition (RA) based on logistic regression analysis of all 5 individual phthalates when complete data were available. DA ref and DA all accurately predicted the observed mixture effect for 11 of 14 endpoints. Furthermore, reproductive tract malformations were seen in 17-100% of F1 males when fetal T production was reduced by about 25-72%, respectively.",PMC4675932

Although males are exposed to combinations of chemicals, few studies have evaluated the effects of ED mixtures at environmentally relevant doses. Our previous work showed that fetal exposure to a mixture of the phytoestrogen genistein (GEN) and the plasticizer di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) induced unique alterations in adult testis. In this follow-up study, we examined Postnatal Day 3 (PND3) and PND6 male offspring exposed from Gestational Day 14 to parturition to corn oil, 10mg/kg GEN, DEHP, or their combination, to gain insight into the early molecular events driving long-term alterations. DEHP stimulated the mRNA and protein expression of the steroidogenic enzyme HSD3B, uniquely at PND3. DEHP also increased the mRNA expression of Nestin, a Leydig progenitor/Sertoli cell marker, and markers of Sertoli cell (Wt1), gonocyte (Plzf, Foxo1), and proliferation (Pcna) at PND3, while these genes were unchanged by the mixture. Redox (Nqo1, Sod2, Sod3, Trx, Gst, Cat) and xenobiotic transporter (Abcb1b, Abcg2) gene expression was also increased by DEHP at PND3, while attenuated when combined with GEN, suggesting the involvement of cellular stress in short-term DEHP effects and a protective effect of GEN. The direct effects of GEN and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, the principal bioactive metabolite of DEHP, on testis were investigated in PND3 organ cultures, showing a stimulatory effect of 10 μM mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate on basal testosterone production that was normalized by GEN. These effects contrasted with previous reports of androgen suppression and decreased gene expression in perinatal rat testis by high DEHP doses, implying that neonatal effects are not predictive of adult effects. We propose that GEN, through an antioxidant action, normalizes reactive oxygen species-induced neonatal effects of DEHP. The notion that these EDs do not follow classical dose-response effects and involve different mechanisms of toxicity from perinatal ages to adulthood highlights the importance of assessing impacts across a range of doses and ages.",PMC4711908

We also analyzed TBBPA for its action on placental secretion of progesterone and β-hCG, cell viability, and apoptosis. Our results showed that after TBBPA treatment at 10 nM and 10 µM, PPARγ protein expression increased in a time-dependent manner until 48 h and then slightly decreased at 72 h but was still above the control level. This alteration in PPARγ protein expression was accompanied by a decreased β-hCG level. Interestingly, co-treatment with the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 reversed the TBBPA-mediated changes in PPARγ protein expression but, according to β-hCG secretion, potentiated an inhibitory effect of TBBPA. Additionally, in our study, we assessed the ability of TBBPA to increase progesterone levels in JEG-3 cells compared with those of controls. Finally, in the present study, we demonstrated that TBBPA at all of the tested doses significantly increased caspase-3 activity compared with that of the vehicle control. The apoptotic action of TBBPA was also confirmed by Hoechst 33342 staining. These results showed the up-regulation of PPARγ protein expression after TBBPA exposure in human placental cells. Although co-treatment with antagonist of PPARγ reversed the TBBPA-mediated increase in this protein expression and restored it to the control level, it did not reverse the effect on β-hCG secretion. This indicated that the mechanism of TBBPA-induced changes in β-hCG secretion is PPARγ-independent.",PMC4589557

Twelve POPs showed significantly different correlations with fat depots in trunk and leg regions. β-hexachlorocyclohexane, heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-126 showed stronger positive correlations with trunk FM% than with leg FM%, whereas PCBs with ≥6 chlorines were more inversely correlated with trunk FM% than leg FM%. Age-stratified analysis showed stronger inverse correlations between POPs and trunk FM% mainly in participants <40 years, whereas stronger positive correlations between POPs and trunk FM% were observed in older participants.

We have previously found associations between prenatal POP exposures and increased BMI, waist circumference and change in BMI from 5 to 7 years of age, though only among girls with overweight mothers. In the same birth cohort, we investigated whether prenatal POP exposure was associated with serum concentrations of insulin and leptin among 5-year-old children, thus possibly mediating the association with overweight and obesity at 7 years of age. The analyses were based on a prospective Faroese Birth Cohort (n=656), recruited between 1997 and 2000. Major POPs, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), were measured in maternal pregnancy serum and breast milk. Children were followed-up at the age of 5 years where a non-fasting blood sample was drawn; 520 children (273 boys and 247 girls) had adequate serum amounts available for biomarker analyses by Luminex® technology. Insulin and leptin concentrations were transformed from continuous to binary variables, using the 75th percentile as a cut-off point. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate associations between prenatal POP exposures and non-fasting serum concentrations of insulin and leptin at age 5 while taking into account confounders.

To address this, the present studies were conducted as part of the CLARITY-BPA (Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity) program. The impact of perinatal BPA exposure (2.5, 25, or 2500 µg/kg body weight (bw)/day) on behaviors related to anxiety and exploratory activity was assessed in juvenile (prepubertal) and adult NCTR Sprague-Dawley rats of both sexes. Ethinyl estradiol (0.5 µg/kg bw/day) was used as a reference estrogen. Exposure spanned gestation and lactation with dams gavaged from gestational day 6 until birth and then the offspring gavaged directly through weaning (n = 12/sex/group). Behavioral assessments included open field, elevated plus maze, and zero maze. Anticipated sex differences in behavior were statistically identified or suggested in most cases. No consistent effects of BPA were observed for any endpoint, in either sex, at either age compared to vehicle controls; however, significant differences between BPA-exposed and ethinyl estradiol-exposed groups were identified for some endpoints.

We quantified exposure to common environmental phthalates, with a focus on the dietary contaminant di-2-ethylhexylphthalate and 2 increasingly used replacements, di-isononyl phthalate and di-isodecyl phthalate, based on micromolar concentration of urinary metabolites. We assessed descriptive, univariate, and multivariable associations with blood pressure and lipids. Controlling for an array of sociodemographic and behavioral factors, as well as diet and body mass, metabolites of di-2-ethylhexylphthalate, di-isononyl phthalate, and di-isodecyl phthalate were associated with higher age-, sex- and height-standardized blood pressure.

Given their ubiquitous nature and potential for adverse effects, a critical need exists for rapidly detecting these chemicals. The authors developed an estrogen-responsive recombinant human ovarian (BG1Luc4E2) cell line recently accepted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as a bioanalytical method to detect estrogen receptor (ER) agonists/antagonists. Unfortunately, these cells appear to contain only 1 of the 2 known ER isoforms, ERα but not ERβ, and the differential ligand selectivity of these ERs indicates that the currently accepted screening method only detects a subset of total estrogenic chemicals. To improve the estrogen screening bioassay, BG1Luc4E2 cells were stably transfected with an ERβ expression plasmid and positive clones identified using ERβ-selective ligands (genistein and Br-ERβ-041). A highly responsive clone (BG1LucERβc9) was identified that exhibited greater sensitivity and responsiveness to ERβ-selective ligands than BG1Luc4E2 cells, and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of ERβ expression in these cells. Screening of pesticides and industrial chemicals identified chemicals that preferentially stimulated ERβ-dependent reporter gene expression. Together, these results not only demonstrate the utility of this dual-ER recombinant cell line for detecting a broader range of estrogenic chemicals than the current BG1Luc4E2 cell line, but screening with both cell lines allows identification of ERα- and ERβ-selective chemicals.",PMC4772679

We then determined whether or not these effects were mediated by estrogen receptors via MAPK pathways. It was found that all four EDCs studied reduced strongly the phagocytosis of the differentiated THP-1 cells and that several of these EDCs disturbed also TNF-α, IL-1 β and IL-8 cytokine secretions. Furthermore, relative to control treatment, decreased ERK 1/2 phosphorylation was always associated with EDCs treatments-either alone or in certain combinations (at 0.1 μM for each condition). Lastly, as treatments by an estrogen receptor antagonist suppressed the negative effects on ERK 1/2 phosphorylation observed in cells treated either alone with BPA, DEHP, 4-OP or with the combined treatment of BPA and DEHP, we suggested that estrogen receptor-dependent pathway is involved in mediating the effects of EDCs on human immune system.

To model heterogeneity in the growth patterns, we used a finite mixture model in combination with a data transformation to characterize body mass index (BMI) with four groups and estimated the association between exposure and group membership. In boys, higher maternal concentrations of DDT and DDE during pregnancy are associated with a BMI growth pattern that is stable until about age five followed by increased growth through age nine. In contrast, higher maternal DDT exposure during pregnancy is associated with a flat, relatively stable growth pattern in girls.

Patients are 3-4 times more likely to be women than men. This gender discrepancy demonstrates a need for an animal model with similar sex differences. 4,4'-Methylenedianiline (DAPM) is an aromatic amine used industrially in the synthesis of polyurethanes. Chronic, intermittent treatment of male and female rats with DAPM resulted in medial hyperplasia of pulmonary arterioles, exclusively in females, coupled to increases in pulmonary arterial pressures. Significant increases in plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and serotonin, but decreases in nitrite [Formula: see text], were observed in females treated with DAPM. A decrease was observed in the serum ratio of the estrogen metabolites 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE1)/16α-hydroxyestrogen (16α-OHE1). In females, ET-1,[Formula: see text] , and 2-OHE1/16α-OHE1 were significantly correlated with peak pressure gradient, an indirect measure of pulmonary arterial pressure. Expression of the serotonin transport protein (SERT) was significantly higher in the arteries of DAPM-treated females. In vitro, DAPM induced human pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and serotonin uptake, both of which were inhibited by treatment with the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 or the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. DAPM also induced the release of serotonin from human pulmonary endothelial cells in culture, which is blocked by ICI 182,780. Taken together, this suggests that DAPM-mediated dysregulation of serotonin transport is estrogen-receptor dependent. Thus, DAPM-induced PAH pathology may be a new tool to clarify the sex selectivity of PAH disease pathogenesis.",PMC4731411

Morphological, stereological and chemical analyses revealed that long-term BPA exposure, even in environmental dosages, increases the proliferative status of the prostate, increases the number of ERα-positive stromal cells and elicits the development of prostatic hyperplasia in adult female gerbils. Moreover, we also observed that the association with testosterone did not increase the proliferative status of the gland, which shows that low levels of BPA are enough to cause an oestrogenic disruption of the prostate in young adults. This evidence suggests that this oestrogenic endocrine disruptor may increase the susceptibility to prostatic disorders with ageing.",PMC4545430

Both a positive control (estradiol benzoate; EB, 50μg/kg) and negative control (dimethylsulfoxide; DMSO in sesame oil vehicle) were similarly administered to separate sets of dams. The sexes responded differently in two tasks essential to sociality. Using a three-chamber apparatus that contained a caged, same-sex, gonadectomized stimulus animal and an empty stimulus cage, we found that both sexes showed a strong preference for affiliating with a stimulus animal (vs. an empty cage), an effect that was much more pronounced in the males. In the second task, a novel and a familiar stimulus animal were caged at opposite ends of the same apparatus. Females displayed a higher degree of novelty preference than the males. During both tests, females had significantly higher social approach behaviors while male engaged in significantly more interactive behaviors with the conspecific. Of particular interest, males born of dams that received prenatal A1221 (0.5mg/kg) exhibited an overall decrease in nose-to-nose investigations. These behavioral data suggest that the males are more sensitive to A1221 treatment than are females. In addition to behavioral analysis, serum corticosterone was measured. Females born of dams treated with A1221 (0.5mg/kg) had significantly higher concentrations of corticosterone than the DMSO female group; males were unaffected.

Previous studies indicate that in utero BPA exposure increases the percentage of germ cells in nests and decreases the percentage of primordial follicles. However, the mechanism by which BPA affects germ cell nest breakdown is unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that BPA inhibits germ cell nest breakdown by interfering with oxidative stress and apoptosis pathways. To test our hypothesis, ovaries from newborn mice were collected and cultured with vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) or different doses of BPA (0.1, 1, 5, and 10μg/mL). Ovaries then were subjected to histological evaluation of germ cell nests and primordial follicles or to measurements of factors that regulate oxidative stress and apoptosis. Our results indicate that in vitro BPA exposure significantly inhibits germ cell nest breakdown by altering the expression of key ovarian apoptotic genes, but not by interfering with the oxidative stress pathway.",PMC4550517

Females exposed to either compound spent less time nursing, grooming and being associated with their pups than controls, although there was little consequence on their weight gain. Care of pups by males was less affected by exposure to BPA and EE, but control, non-exposed females appeared able to ""sense"" a male partner previously exposed to either compound and, as a consequence, reduced their own parental investment in offspring from such pairings. The data emphasize the potential vulnerability of pups born to parents that had been exposed during their own early development to EDC, and that effects on the male, although subtle, also have consequences on overall parental care due to lack of full acceptance of the male by the female partner.",PMC4454565

We investigated the possibility of measuring multiday exposure to BPA in human sweat among volunteer participants with the goal of identifying an exposure assessment method less affected by temporal variability. We recruited 50 participants to wear a sweat collection patch (PharmChek(®)) for 7 days with concurrent collection of daily first-morning urine. Urines and sweat patch extracts were analyzed with quantitative LC-MS-MS using a method we previously validated. In addition, a human volunteer consumed one can of commercially available soup (16 oz, 473 cm(3)) daily for 3 days and collected urine. Sweat patches (n = 2, 1 per arm) were worn for the 3 days of the study. BPA was detected in quality control specimens prepared by fortification of BPA to sweat patches, but was only detected at 5× above average background on three participant patches. Although the highest measured urine BPA concentration was 195 ng/mL for an individual with deliberate exposure, no BPA was detected above background in the corresponding sweat patches. In this preliminary investigation, the use of sweat patches primarily worn on the upper-outer arm did not detect BPA exposures that were documented by urine monitoring. The absence of BPA in sweat patches may be due to several factors, including insufficient quantity of specimen per patch, or extremely low concentrations of BPA in naturally occurring sweat, among others.",PMC9248020

While these steroids can influence development, embryonic enzymes are thought to buffer some steroid sensitive processes, such as gonadal differentiation, from the effects of maternal steroids. Many of these same enzymes may also buffer the embryo from chemicals present in the environment, but this may alter their capacity to metabolize maternal steroids. Here, we characterized the ability of red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta) embryos to metabolize oestrone immediately following oviposition and tested whether a prevalent environmental chemical, Bisphenol A (BPA), would affect the in ovo conversion of oestrone to oestrone sulfate. We found that tritiated oestrone applied at the time of oviposition is mostly converted to oestrone sulfate within 6 h. However, when BPA is present, that conversion is inhibited, resulting in elevated oestrone levels. Our finding of rapid in ovo metabolism of steroids suggests that maternally derived enzymes are present in the egg and can alter embryonic exposure to exogenous chemicals. The disruption of this metabolism by BPA demonstrates how environmental chemicals might change embryonic exposure to endogenous substances within the egg.

However, direct evidence supporting a causal role for exposure to phthalates in type 2 diabetes is lacking. To determine the potential influence of phthalates on glucose homeostasis and atherosclerosis, female apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe(-/-)) mice were started at 6 weeks of age on a Western diet together with or without Bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Phthalate was administered in drinking water at a daily dosage of 100 mg/kg. We examined glucose and insulin tolerance, plasma glucose and triglyceride levels, body weight, and atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root. Two weeks after treatment, phthalate-exposed mice had significantly higher fasting blood glucose level (97.9 ± 2.1 vs. 84.3 ± 5.3 mg/dl, P = 0.034) and exhibited a trend of increased glucose intolerance compared to control mice.

Additional analysis of genomic imprints shows no persistent aberrations in DNA methylation at the differentially methylated regions of imprinted genes between the G1 and G2 prospermatogonia, or in the allele-specific transcription of imprinted genes between the G2 and G3 soma. Our results suggest that endocrine-disrupting chemicals exert direct epigenetic effects in exposed fetal germ cells, which are corrected by reprogramming events in the next generation.

Many EDCs have been implicated in activation of the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR), which acts as a xenobiotic sensor to regulate xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine. Here we report an important role of intestinal PXR in linking xenobiotic exposure and hyperlipidemia. We identified tributyl citrate (TBC), one of a large group of Food and Drug Administration-approved plasticizers for pharmaceutical or food applications, as a potent and selective PXR agonist. TBC efficiently activated PXR and induced PXR target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, TBC activated intestinal PXR but did not affect hepatic PXR activity. Exposure to TBC increased plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in wild-type mice, but not in PXR-deficient mice. TBC-mediated PXR activation stimulated the expression of an essential cholesterol transporter, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), in the intestine. Promoter analysis revealed a DR-4 type of PXR response element in the human NPC1L1 promoter, and TBC promoted PXR recruitment onto the NPC1L1 promoter. Consistently, TBC treatment significantly increased lipid uptake by human and murine intestinal cells and deficiency of PXR inhibited TBC-elicited lipid uptake. These findings provide critical mechanistic insight for understanding the impact of EDC-mediated PXR activation on lipid homeostasis and demonstrate a potential role of PXR in mediating the adverse effects of EDCs on cardiovascular disease risk in humans.",PMC4415211

The binding affinities of BPA were slightly lower than that of E2 to these three receptors. The simulation results proved that the binding process was mainly driven by direct hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions.

While obesity is typically regarded as an increase in visceral fat, adipocyte accumulation in the bone has been linked to increased fracture risk, lower bone density, and osteoporosis. Exposure to environmental toxicants that activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a critical regulator of the balance of differentiation between adipogenesis and osteogenesis, may contribute to the increasing prevalence of osteoporosis. However, induction of adipogenesis and suppression of osteogenesis are separable activities of PPARγ, and ligands may selectively alter these activities. It currently is unknown whether suppression of osteogenesis is a common toxic endpoint of environmental PPARγ ligands. Using a primary mouse bone marrow culture model, we tested the hypothesis that environmental toxicants acting as PPARγ agonists divert the differentiation pathway of bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells towards adipogenesis and away from osteogenesis. The toxicants tested included the organotins tributyltin and triphenyltin, a ubiquitous phthalate metabolite (mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, MEHP), and two brominated flame retardants (tetrabromobisphenol-a, TBBPA, and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate, METBP). All of the compounds activated PPARγ1 and 2. All compounds increased adipogenesis (lipid accumulation, Fabp4 expression) and suppressed osteogenesis (alkaline phosphatase activity, Osx expression) in mouse primary bone marrow cultures, but with different potencies and efficacies. Despite structural dissimilarities, there was a strong negative correlation between efficacies to induce adipogenesis and suppress osteogenesis, with the organotins being distinct in their exceptional ability to suppress osteogenesis.

Our results showed that high concentrations of BPA inhibited sperm motility and motion kinematics by significantly decreasing ATP levels in spermatozoa. High BPA concentrations also increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on sperm proteins involved in protein kinase A-dependent regulation and induced a precocious acrosome reaction, which resulted in poor fertilization and compromised embryonic development. In addition, BPA induced the down-regulation of β-actin and up-regulated peroxiredoxin-5, glutathione peroxidase 4, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and succinate dehydrogenase.

The Faroe Islands community exhibits an unusually wide range of exposures to dietary contaminants, and in this setting we examined the possible association between PCB exposure and semen quality and reproductive hormones in fertile Faroese men. Participants in this cross-sectional study include 266 proven fertile men residing in the Faroe Islands. PCB levels and hormone profiles were measured in serum samples taken at the clinical examination that included semen quality parameters. A significant positive association was seen between serum-PCB and the testosterone/estradiol ratio (p=0.04). In the unadjusted analyses, elevated PCB exposure was associated with increased serum concentrations of SHBG (p=0.01) and FSH (p=0.05). We found no association between the serum PCB concentration and the semen quality variables.

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) is increasingly recognized as a contributor, independent of diet and physical activity. The objective was to estimate obesity, diabetes, and associated costs that can be reasonably attributed to EDC exposures in the EU. An expert panel evaluated evidence for probability of causation using weight-of-evidence characterization adapted from that applied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Exposure-response relationships and reference levels were evaluated for relevant EDCs, and biomarker data were organized from peer-reviewed studies to represent European exposure and burden of disease. Cost estimation as of 2010 utilized published cost estimates for childhood obesity, adult obesity, and adult diabetes. Setting, Patients and Participants, and Intervention: Cost estimation was performed from the societal perspective. The panel identified a 40% to 69% probability of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene causing 1555 cases of overweight at age 10 (sensitivity analysis: 1555-5463) in 2010 with associated costs of €24.6 million (sensitivity analysis: €24.6-86.4 million).

Several experimental and epidemiological studies suggest that gestational BPA exposure can lead to neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems in early-life, but results have been inconsistent. We previously reported that prenatal BPA exposure may affect child behavior and differently among boys and girls at ages 3-5 years. We investigated the association of prenatal and early childhood BPA exposure with behavioral outcomes in 7-9 year old minority children and hypothesized that we would observe the same sex-specific pattern observed at earlier ages. African-American and Dominican women enrolled in an inner-city prospective cohort study and their children were followed from mother's pregnancy through children's age 7-9 years. Women during the third trimester of pregnancy and children at ages 3 and 5 years provided spot urine samples. BPA exposure was categorized by tertiles of BPA urinary concentrations. The Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) was administered at ages 7 and 9 to assess multiple child behavior domains. Associations between behavior and prenatal (maternal) BPA concentrations and behavior and postnatal (child) BPA concentration were assessed via Poisson regression in models stratified by sex. These models accounted for potential confounders including prenatal or postnatal urinary BPA concentrations, child age at CBCL assessment, ethnicity, gestational age, maternal intelligence, maternal education and demoralization, quality of child's home environment, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure, and prenatal mono-n-butyl phthalate concentration. The direction of the associations differed between boys and girls. Among boys (n=115), high prenatal BPA concentration (upper tertile vs. lower two tertiles) was associated with increased internalizing (β=0.41, p<0.0001) and externalizing composite scores (β=0.40, p<0.0001) and with their corresponding individual syndrome scales. There was a general decrease in scores among girls that was significant for the internalizing composite score (β=-0.17, p=0.04) (n=135). After accounting for possible selection bias, the results remained consistent for boys. Conversely, high postnatal BPA concentration was associated with increased behaviors on both the internalizing composite (β=0.30, p=0.0002) and externalizing composite scores (β=0.33, p<0.0001) and individual subscores in girls but fewer symptoms in boys.

We have previously shown that bisphenol A (BPA) accelerates the spontaneous development of diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Here, we hypothesized that oral exposure to a mixture of the endocrine disruptors BPA and phthalates, relevant for human exposure, would accelerate diabetes development compared to BPA alone. NOD mice were exposed to BPA (1 mg/l), a mixture of phthalates (DEHP 1 mg/l, DBP 0.2 mg/l, BBP 10 mg/l and DiBP 20 mg/l) or a combination of BPA and the phthalate mixture through drinking water from conception and throughout life. Previous observations that BPA exposure increased the prevalence of diabetes and insulitis and decreased the number of tissue resident macrophages in pancreas were confirmed, and extended by demonstrating that BPA exposure also impaired the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages. None of these effects were observed after phthalate exposure alone. The phthalate exposure in combination with BPA seemed to dampen the BPA effects on macrophage number and function as well as diabetes development, but not insulitis development. Exposure to BPA alone or in combination with phthalates decreased cytokine release (TNFα, IL-6, IL-10, IFNγ, IL-4) from in vitro stimulated splenocytes and lymph node cells, indicating systemic changes in immune function.

We investigated possible direct endocrine disruption by BPA of the fetal testes of 2 rat strains (14.5-17.5 days post-coitum) and humans (8-12 gestational weeks) and under different culture conditions. BPA concentrations of 10(-8)M and 10(-5)M for 72 h reduced testosterone production by the Sprague-Dawley fetal rat testes, while only 10-5M suppressed it in the Wistar strain. The suppressive effects at 10-5M were seen as early as 24h and 48 h in both strains. BPA at 10(-7)-10(-5)M for 72 h suppressed the levels of fetal rat Leydig cell insulin-like factor 3 (INSL3). BPA exposure at 10(-8)M, 10(-7)M, and 10(-5)M for 72 h inhibited testosterone production in fetal human testes. For the lowest doses, the effects observed occurred only when no gonadotrophin was added to the culture media and were associated with a poorly preserved testicular morphology. We concluded that (i) BPA can display anti-androgenic effects both in rat and human fetal testes; (ii) it is essential to ascertain that the divergent effects of endocrine disruptors between species in vitro do not result from the culture conditions used, and/or the rodent strain selected; (iii) the optimization of each in vitro assay for a given species should be a major objective rather than the search of an hypothetical trans-species consensual model-system, as the organization of the testis is intrinsically different between mammalian species; (iv) due to the uncertainty existing on the internal exposure of the human fetal testis to BPA, and the insufficient number of epidemiological studies on the endocrine disruptive effects of BPA, caution should be taken in the extrapolation of our present results to the human reproductive health after fetal exposure to BPA.",PMC4338204

Antral follicles are the functional ovarian units and must undergo growth, survival from atresia, and proper regulation of steroidogenesis to ovulate and produce hormones. Previous studies have determined that DEHP inhibits antral follicle growth and decreases estradiol levels in vitro; however, the mechanism by which DEHP elicits these effects is unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that DEHP directly alters regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis to inhibit antral follicle functionality. Antral follicles from adult CD-1 mice were cultured with vehicle control or DEHP (1-100 μg/ml) for 24-96 h to establish the temporal effects of DEHP on the follicle. Following 24-96 h of culture, antral follicles were subjected to gene expression analysis, and media were subjected to measurements of hormone levels. DEHP increased the mRNA levels of cyclin D2, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin E1, cyclin A2, and cyclin B1 and decreased the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A prior to growth inhibition. Additionally, DEHP increased the mRNA levels of BCL2-associated agonist of cell death, BCL2-associated X protein, BCL2-related ovarian killer protein, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, and Bcl2-like 10, leading to an increase in atresia. Further, DEHP decreased the levels of progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone prior to the decrease in estradiol levels, with decreased mRNA levels of side-chain cleavage, 17α-hydroxylase-17,20-desmolase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and aromatase.

Strikingly, treatment of embryonic zebrafish with very low-dose BPA (0.0068 μM, 1,000-fold lower than the accepted human daily exposure) and bisphenol S (BPS), a common analog used in BPA-free products, resulted in 180% and 240% increases, respectively, in neuronal birth (neurogenesis) within the hypothalamus, a highly conserved brain region involved in hyperactivity. Furthermore, restricted BPA/BPS exposure specifically during the neurogenic window caused later hyperactive behaviors in zebrafish larvae. Unexpectedly, we show that BPA-mediated precocious neurogenesis and the concomitant behavioral phenotype were not dependent on predicted estrogen receptors but relied on androgen receptor-mediated up-regulation of aromatase. Although human epidemiological results are still emerging, an association between high maternal urinary BPA during gestation and hyperactivity and other behavioral disturbances in the child has been suggested. Our studies here provide mechanistic support that the neurogenic period indeed may be a window of vulnerability and uncovers previously unexplored avenues of research into how endocrine disruptors might perturb early brain development.

Genistein (GEN) is one of the isoflavones ingredients exhibiting weak estrogenic and potentially antioxidative effects. However, study on reproductive effects following prepubertal multiple endocrine disrupters exposure has been lacking. In this study, DEHP and GEN were administrated to prepubertal male Sprague-Dawley rats by gavage from postnatal day 22 (PND22) to PND35 with vehicle control, GEN at 50 mg/kg body weight (bw)/day (G), DEHP at 50, 150, 450 mg/kg bw/day (D50, D150, D450) and their mixture (G + D50, G + D150, G + D450). On PND90, general morphometry (body weight, AGD, organ weight, and organ coefficient), testicular redox state, and testicular histology were studied. Our results indicated that DEHP could significantly decrease sex organs weight, organ coefficient, and testicular antioxidative ability, which largely depended on the dose of DEHP. However, coadministration of GEN could partially alleviate DEHP-induced reproductive injuries via enhancement of testicular antioxidative enzymes activities, which indicates that GEN has protective effects on DEHP-induced male reproductive system damage after prepubertal exposure and GEN may have promising future in its curative antioxidative role for reproductive disorders caused by other environmental endocrine disruptors.",PMC4228721

The objective of the current study was to assess the association between exposure markers of various EDCs and thyroxine (T4) levels in newborns in a mother-child cohort in the Netherlands. Exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), three di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-153, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was determined in cord plasma or breast milk, and information on T4 levels in heel prick blood spots was obtained through the neonatal screening programme in the Netherlands. Linear regression models were composed to determine associations between each of the compounds and T4, which were stratified for gender and adjusted for a priori defined covariates. Mean T4 level was 86.9 nmol/L (n = 83). Girls in the highest quartile of DDE and PFOA exposure showed an increased T4 level compared to the lowest quartile with both crude and fully adjusted models (DDE > 107.50 ng/L, +24.8 nmol/L, 95% CI 0.79, 48.75; PFOA > 1200 ng/L, +38.6 nmol/L, 95% CI 13.34, 63.83). In boys a lower T4 level was seen in the second quartile of exposure for both PFOS and PFOA, however after fully adjusting the models these associations were attenuated. No effects were observed for the other compounds. DDE and perfluorinated alkyl acids may be associated with T4 in a sex-specific manner. These results should however be interpreted with caution, due to the relatively small study population.

We evaluated 576 men with newly diagnosed PCa (before treatment) and 655 controls in Guadeloupe (French West Indies). Exposure was analyzed according to case-control status.

Several reports have shown that endocrine disruptors such as Bisphenol-A (BPA) and Nonylphenol (NP) induce germ cell apoptosis along with a decrease in sperm production. Given their ubiquitous distribution in plastic products used by humans it is important to clarify their mechanism of action. TACE/ADAM17 is a widely distributed extracellular metalloprotease and participates in the physiological apoptosis of germ cells during spermatogenesis. The aims of this work were: 1) to determine whether BPA and NP induce ADAM17 activation; and 2) to study whether ADAM17 and/or ADAM10 are involved in germ cell apoptosis induced by BPA and NP in the pubertal rat testis. A single dose of BPA or NP (50 mg/kg) induces germ cell apoptosis in 21-day-old male rats, which was prevented by a pharmacological inhibitor of ADAM17, but not by an inhibitor of ADAM10. In vitro, we showed that BPA and NP, at similar concentrations to those found in human samples, induce the shedding of exogenous and endogenous (TNF-α) ADAM17 substrates in primary rat Sertoli cell cultures and TM4 cell line. In addition, pharmacological inhibitors of metalloproteases and genetic silencing of ADAM17 prevent the shedding induced in vitro by BPA and NP. Finally, we showed that in vivo BPA and NP induced early activation (phosphorylation) of p38 MAPK and translocation of ADAM17 to the cell surface. Interestingly, the inhibition of p38 MAPK prevents germ cell apoptosis and translocation of ADAM17 to the cell surface. These results show for the first time that xenoestrogens can induce activation of ADAM17 at concentrations similar to those found in human samples, suggesting a mechanism by which they could imbalance para/juxtacrine cell-to-cell-communication and induce germ cell apoptosis.",PMC4256297

Although the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm historically has focused on nutrition, an expanding body of research specifically communicates the effects of chemical exposures on early-life development and the propagation of non-communicable disease across the lifespan. This paper provides an overview of 20 years of research efforts aimed at identifying critical windows of susceptibility to environmental exposures and the signaling changes and epigenetic influences associated with disease progression. DOHaD grants funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in 1991, 2001 and 2011 are identified by grant-analysis software, and each portfolio is analyzed for exposures, disease endpoints, windows of exposure, study design and impact on the field based on publication data. Results show that the 1991 and 2001 portfolios comprised metals, PCBs and air pollutants; however, by 2011, the portfolio has evolved to include or expand the variety of endocrine disruptors, pesticides/persistent organic pollutants and metals. An assortment of brain-health endpoints is most targeted across the portfolios, whereas reproduction and cancer increase steadily over the same time period, and new endpoints like obesity are introduced by 2011. With mounting evidence connecting early-life exposures to later-life disease, we conclude that it is critical to expand the original DOHaD concept to include environmental chemical exposures, and to continue a research agenda that emphasizes defining sensitive windows of exposure and the mechanisms that cause disease.",PMC4393755

Traditional diagnostic applications of AF have focused almost exclusively on the diagnosis of genetic aberrations such as Trisomy-21 and on heritable diseases in high-risk pregnancies. Since more than 50 anthropogenic compounds have been detected in AF, there is considerable potential in utilizing fetal protein biomarkers as indicators of health effects related to prenatal toxic exposure. Here, we focus on preterm birth (PTB) to illustrate opportunities and limitations of using AF as a diagnostic matrix. Representing a pervasive public health challenge worldwide, PTB cannot be managed simply by improving hygiene and broadening access to healthcare. This is illustrated by 15-year increases of PTB in the U.S. from 1989 to 2004. AF is uniquely suited as a matrix for early detection of the association between fetal exposures and PTB due to its fetal origin and the fact that it is sampled from women who are at higher risk of PTB. This critical review shows the occurrence in AF of a number of xenobiotics, including endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), which are known or may reasonably be expected to shorten fetal gestation. It is not yet known whether EDCs, including bisphenol A, phytoestrogens, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), can affect the expression of proteins considered viable or potential biomarkers for the onset of PTB. As such, the diagnostic value of AF is broad and has not yet been fully explored for prenatal diagnosis of pregnancies at risk from toxic, environmental exposures and for the elucidation of mechanisms underlying important public health challenges including PTB.",PMC4279852

Increasing evidence suggests that BPA mimics estrogens in the body and may be associated with putative markers of breast cancer risk. We analyzed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003-2010 data to investigate the association of BPA with age at menarche in adolescent girls. We hypothesized that urinary BPA, as a surrogate biomarker for BPA exposure, is associated with earlier age at menarche, and that body mass index (BMI) may modulate this association. We conducted cross-sectional analyses of urinary BPA, BMI and age of menarche in a subsample of 987 adolescent girls aged 12-19, using pooled data from the 2003-2010 NHANES. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between urinary BPA and early onset of menarche, with adjustment for sampling design. We additionally assessed interaction of BPA with BMI. Adolescent girls with moderate BPA levels appeared to be less likely to have early onset of menarche than those with the lowest levels (OR=0.57; 95% CI=0.30, 1.08) after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, parental education, country of birth, NHANES cycle, BMI and creatinine. BMI appeared to modify the BPA-menarche association.

Many of such EDCs have been shown to adversely influence brain mesocorticolimbic systems raising the potential for cumulative toxicity. As such, understanding the effects of developmental exposure to mixtures of EDCs is critical to public health protection. Consequently, this study compared the effects of a mixture of four EDCs to their effects alone to examine potential for enhanced toxicity, using behavioral domains and paradigms known to be mediated by mesocorticolimbic circuits (fixed interval (FI) schedule controlled behavior, novel object recognition memory and locomotor activity) in offspring of pregnant mice that had been exposed to vehicle or relatively low doses of four EDCs, atrazine (ATR - 10mg/kg), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA - 0.1mg/kg), bisphenol-A (BPA - 50 μg/kg), 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD - 0.25 μg/kg) alone or combined in a mixture (MIX), from gestational day 7 until weaning. EDC-treated males maintained significantly higher horizontal activity levels across three testing sessions, indicative of delayed habituation, whereas no effects were found in females. Statistically significant effects of MIX were seen in males, but not females, in the form of increased FI response rates, in contrast to reductions in response rate with ATR, BPA and TCDD, and reduced short term memory in the novel object recognition paradigm. MIX also reversed the typically lower neophobia levels of males compared to females. With respect to individual EDCs, TCDD produced notable increases in FI response rates in females, and PFOA significantly increased ambulatory locomotor activity in males. Collectively, these findings show the potential for enhanced behavioral effects of EDC mixtures in males and underscore the need for animal studies to fully investigate mixtures, including chemicals that converge on common physiological substrates to examine potential mechanisms of toxicity with full dose effect curves to assist in interpretations of relevant mechanisms.",PMC4387783

Although they are best known as anti-androgens, increasingly, evidence suggests that phthalates, particularly di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), may also suppress estrogen production. Given that both androgens and estrogens are essential for sexual function, particularly sexual interest, it is plausible that adult exposure to phthalates alters sexual function. To this end, we used data from 360 women participating in a pregnancy cohort study (the Study for Future Families) to examine whether urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations were associated with two dimensions of self-reported sexual dysfunction in the months prior to conception: lack of sexual interest and vaginal dryness. Women in the highest quartile of urinary concentrations of mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate, a DEHP metabolite, had 2.58 (95% CI 1.33, 5.00) times the adjusted odds of reporting that they almost always or often lacked interest in sexual activity, and results were similar for mono-2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl phthalate (aOR: 2.56, 95% CI 1.32, 4.95), another DEHP metabolite. Self-reported vaginal dryness was not associated with any phthalate metabolite concentration. This study is novel in its focus on sexual function in relation to environmentally relevant (rather than occupational) exposure to phthalates in adult women and these preliminary findings merit replication in a large, prospective study.

Arenas were divided into three computer-generated zones to represent different distances from mirror image. Circadian rhythm patterns were evaluated at 1-3 (= AM) and 5-8 (= PM) h postprandial. Adult zebrafish were placed into arenas and monitored by digital camera for 5 min. Total distance traveled, percent of time spent at mirror image, and number of attacks on mirror image were quantified.

However, free BPA is applied to the outer layer of thermal receipt paper present in very high (∼20 mg BPA/g paper) quantities as a print developer. Not taken into account when considering thermal paper as a source of BPA exposure is that some commonly used hand sanitizers, as well as other skin care products, contain mixtures of dermal penetration enhancing chemicals that can increase by up to 100 fold the dermal absorption of lipophilic compounds such as BPA. We found that when men and women held thermal receipt paper immediately after using a hand sanitizer with penetration enhancing chemicals, significant free BPA was transferred to their hands and then to French fries that were eaten, and the combination of dermal and oral BPA absorption led to a rapid and dramatic average maximum increase (Cmax) in unconjugated (bioactive) BPA of ∼7 ng/mL in serum and ∼20 µg total BPA/g creatinine in urine within 90 min. The default method used by regulatory agencies to test for hazards posed by chemicals is intra-gastric gavage. For BPA this approach results in less than 1% of the administered dose being bioavailable in blood. It also ignores dermal absorption as well as sublingual absorption in the mouth that both bypass first-pass liver metabolism.

Several chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls are metabolized by the dioxin-inducible enzyme CYP1A1; some of their metabolites can interact with the TH receptor. In animals, this mechanism is reflected by a strong correlation between the expression of CYP1A1 mRNA and TH-regulated mRNAs. If this mechanism occurs in humans, we expect that CYP1A1 expression will be positively correlated with the expression of genes regulated by TH. The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that CYP1A1 mRNA expression is correlated with TH-regulated mRNAs in human placenta. One hundred sixty-four placental samples from pregnancies with no thyroid disease were obtained from the GESTE study (Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada). Maternal and cord blood TH levels were measured at birth. The mRNA levels of CYP1A1 and placental TH receptor targets [placental lactogen (PL) and GH-V] were quantitated by quantitative PCR. CYP1A1 mRNA abundance varied 5-fold across 132 placental samples that had detectable CYP1A1 mRNA. CYP1A1 mRNA was positively correlated with PL (r = 0.64; P < .0001) and GH-V (P < .0001, r = 0.62) mRNA. PL and GH-V mRNA were correlated with each other (r = 0.95; P < .0001), suggesting a common activator. The mRNAs not regulated by TH were not correlated with CYP1A1 expression. CYP1A1 mRNA expression is strongly associated with the expression of TH-regulated target gene mRNAs in human placenta, consistent with the endocrine-disrupting action of metabolites produced by CYP1A1.",PMC4255108

25243857,"Chinaza Egbuta, Jessica Lo, Debashis Ghosh",Mechanism of inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis by azole fungicides.,2014,"Biosynthesis of estrogens from androgens is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 aromatase. Aromatase inhibition by the triazole compounds letrozole (LTZ) and anastrozole is a prevalent therapy for estrogen-dependent postmenopausal breast cancer. Azoles are widely used as agricultural fungicides and antimycotic drugs that target 14α-demethylase. Some were previously shown to inhibit aromatase, thereby raising the possibility of endocrine disruptive effects. However, mechanistic analysis of their inhibition has never been undertaken. We have evaluated the inhibitory effects of 3 common fungicides, bifonazole, imazalil, and flusilazole, in human aromatase purified from placenta and compared them with LTZ, the most potent inhibitor of aromatase. Bifonazole exhibits strong inhibitory effects with an IC50 of 270nM and Ki (Michaeles-Menten inhibition constant) of 68nM, compared with 10nM and 13nM, respectively, for LTZ. The IC50 and Ki are 1100nM and 278nM for imazilil and 3200nM and 547nM for flusilazole, respectively. Analyses of inhibition kinetics suggest that the modes of inhibition by azole fungicides are mixed or competitive, whereas LTZ inhibition could be noncompetitive or mixed. We interpret the inhibition mechanism in the context of the x-ray structure of aromatase-androstenedione complex. Structural data show that aromatase has 3 binding pockets in relation to the heme. The substrate-binding cavity at the heme-distal site closely compliments the structures of the natural substrate, androstenedione, and steroidal aromatase inhibitors. Because the structures of LTZ and the azole fungicides are entirely dissimilar to the androstenedione backbone, the azoles possibly inhibit by binding to a structurally rearranged active site, the 2 other catalytically important sites, or both, in agreement with the kinetics data.",PMC4239419

Developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have been hypothesized to exacerbate risk, in part because PCOS hallmarks and associated metabolic co-morbidities can be reliably induced in animal models by perinatal androgen exposure. Here we show that lifetime exposure to a soy diet, containing endocrine active phytoestrogens, but not developmental exposure (gestational day 6-lactational day 40) to the endocrine disrupting monomer bisphenol A (BPA), can induce key features of PCOS in the rat; results which support the hypothesis that hormonally active diets may contribute to risk when consumed throughout gestation and post-natal life.",PMC4366357

Therefore, EU legislation for pesticides requires the evaluation of single active substances as well as the consideration of combination effects. Hence the analysis of combined effects of substances in a broad dose range represents a key challenge to current experimental and regulatory toxicology. Here we report evidence for additive effects for (tri)azole fungicides, a widely used group of antifungal agents, in the human placental cell line Jeg-3. In addition to the triazoles cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, flusilazole and tebuconazole and the azole fungicide prochloraz also pesticides from other chemical classes assumed to act via different modes of action (i.e., the organophosphate chlorpyrifos and the triazinylsulfonylurea herbicide triflusulfuron-methyl) were investigated. Endpoints analysed include synthesis of steroid hormone production (progesterone and estradiol) and gene expression of steroidogenic and non-steroidogenic cytochrome-P-450 (CYP) enzymes. For the triazoles and prochloraz, a dose dependent inhibition of progesterone production was observed and additive effects could be confirmed for several combinations of these substances in vitro. The non-triazoles chlorpyrifos and triflusulfuron-methyl did not affect this endpoint and, in line with this finding, no additivity was observed when these substances were applied in mixtures with prochloraz. While prochloraz slightly increased aromatase expression and estradiol production and triflusulfuron-methyl decreased estradiol production, none of the other substances had effects on the expression levels of steroidogenic CYP-enzymes in Jeg-3 cells. For some triazoles, prochloraz and chlorpyrifos a significant induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression and potential combination effects for this endpoint were observed.

Research suggests that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may play a role but exposure at multiple stages of development has not been considered. We examined in utero and peripubertal exposure to bisphenol-A (BPA) and phthalates in relation to serum hormones and sexual maturation among females in a Mexico City birth cohort. We measured phthalate metabolite and BPA concentrations in urine collected from mothers during their third trimester (n=116) and from their female children at ages 8-13 years (n=129). Among girls, we measured concurrent serum hormone concentrations, Tanner stages for breast and pubic hair development, and collected information on menarche onset. We used linear and logistic regression to model associations between in utero and peripubertal measures of exposure with hormones and sexual maturation, respectively, controlling for covariates. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in in utero urinary mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) was positively associated with 29% (95% CI: 9.2-52.6%) higher dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), an early indicator of adrenarche, and 5.3 (95% CI: 1.13-24.9) times higher odds of a Tanner stage >1 for pubic hair development.

We found that 100 nM TBT reduced the amounts of α-ketoglutarate, succinate and malate. We further found that TBT decreased the activity of NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NAD-IDH), which catalyzes the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate in the TCA cycle. In addition, TBT inhibited cell growth and enhanced neuronal differentiation through NAD-IDH inhibition. Furthermore, studies using bacterially expressed human NAD-IDH and in silico simulations suggest that TBT inhibits NAD-IDH due to a possible interaction. These results suggest that NAD-IDH is a novel non-genomic target of TBT at nanomolar levels. Thus, a metabolomic approach may provide new insights into the mechanism of EDC action.",PMC4121607

To address these data gaps, we employed a novel animal model for neuroendocrine toxicology: the prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), which are more prosocial than lab rats or mice. Male and female prairie vole pups were orally exposed to 5-μg/kg body weight (bw)/d, 50-μg/kg bw/d, or 50-mg/kg bw/d BPA or vehicle over postnatal days 8-14. Subjects were tested as juveniles in open field and novel social tests and for partner preference as adults. Brains were then collected and assessed for immunoreactive (ir) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (a dopamine marker) neurons in the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (pBNST) and TH-ir, OT-ir, and AVP-ir neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). Female open field activity indicated hyperactivity at the lowest dose and anxiety at the highest dose. Effects on social interactions were also observed, and partner preference formation was mildly inhibited at all dose levels. BPA masculinized principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis TH-ir neuron numbers in females. Additionally, 50-mg/kg bw BPA-exposed females had more AVP-ir neurons in the anterior PVN and fewer OT-ir neurons in the posterior PVN. At the 2 lowest doses, BPA eliminated sex differences in PVN TH-ir neuron numbers and reversed this sex difference at the highest dose. Minimal behavioral effects were observed in BPA-exposed males.

A meta-analysis of three public microarray datasets was performed to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in exposure to BPA. The candidate genes of neuronal development were identified from gene ontology analysis in a reconstructed neuronal sub-network, and their gene expressions were determined using real-time PCR in 20 umbilical cord blood samples dichotomized into high and low BPA level groups upon the median 16.8 nM.

As a xenosensor, the pregnane X receptor (hPXR) is activated by numerous pesticides, the combined effect of which is currently unknown. We examined the activation of hPXR by seven pesticide mixtures most likely found in the French diet and their individual components. The mixture's effect was estimated using the concentration addition (CA) model. PXR transactivation was measured by monitoring luciferase activity in hPXR/HepG2 cells and CYP3A4 expression in human hepatocytes. The three mixtures with the highest potency were evaluated using the CA model, at equimolar concentrations and at their relative proportion in the diet. The seven mixtures significantly activated hPXR and induced the expression of CYP3A4 in human hepatocytes. Of the 14 pesticides which constitute the three most active mixtures, four were found to be strong hPXR agonists, four medium, and six weak. Depending on the mixture and pesticide proportions, additive, greater than additive or less than additive effects between compounds were demonstrated. Predictions of the combined effects were obtained with both real-life and equimolar proportions at low concentrations. Pesticides act mostly additively to activate hPXR, when present in a mixture.

Whole genome RNA sequencing was performed to assess gene expression in DDT-treated MSCs. MSCs exposed to DDT formed fewer colonies, suggesting a reduction in self-renewal potential. DDT enhanced both adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, which was confirmed by increased mRNA expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), lipoprotein lipase (LpL), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), leptin, osteonectin, core binding factor 1 (CBFA1), and FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (c-Fos). Expression of factors in DDT-treated cells was similar to that in estrogen-treated MSCs, suggesting that DDT may function via the estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated pathway. The coadministration of ICI 182,780 blocked the effects of DDT. RNA sequencing revealed 121 genes and noncoding RNAs to be differentially expressed in DDT-treated MSCs compared with controls cells. Human MSCs provide a powerful biological system to investigate and identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of environmental agents on stem cells and human health.

Serum corticosterone levels in response to a 1 h restraint stress and spine density were examined at age 7 (cohort 1) and 11 (cohort 2) weeks. Adolescent BPA exposure did not alter stress dependent corticosterone responses but decreased spine density on apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal CA1 region (CA1). Sex differences in spine density were observed on basal dendrites of the mPFC and CA1 with females having greater spine density than males. This sex difference was further augmented by both age and treatment, with results indicating that BPA-dependent decreases in spine density were more pronounced in males than females on mPFC basal dendrites. Importantly, the robust neuronal alterations were observed in animals exposed to BPA levels below the current U.S.E.P.A. recommended safe daily limit. These results are the first demonstrating that BPA given during adolescence leads to enduring effects on neural morphology at adulthood.

Our study was restricted to a total of 196 women co-enrolled in the Predictors of Preeclampsia Study and the Harvard Epigenetic Birth Cohort. First trimester urine concentrations of 8 phenols and 11 phthalate metabolites were measured and used to characterize EDC exposure profiles. We assessed methylation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by pyrosequencing of H19, IGF2DMR0, and IGF2DMR2 and correlated values with phenol and phthalate metabolites. We also assessed overall expression and allele-specific expression of H19 and IGF2. We found several significant associations between DNA methylation and additive biomarker measurements. A significant decrease in H19 methylation was associated with high levels of the sum (Σ) of phthalate metabolites and metabolites of low molecular weight (LMW) phthalates. Σphthalate and LMW phthalate concentrations were inversely associated with IGF2DMR0 methylation values. Variation in methylation was not associated with changes in allele-specific expression. However increased deviation of allele-specific expression of H19 was associated with Σdi(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate metabolites and high molecular weight phthalates.

This occurred with no regulation of products to which pregnant women are exposed, such as food packaging and cosmetics. Pregnant women, physicians and midwives were recruited through posters and pamphlets in prenatal clinics in Southwestern Ontario for a semi-structured interview. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and subjected to rigorous qualitative analysis through a grounded theory approach, supported by NVIVO™ software. Themes emerged from line by line, open, and axial coding in an iterative manner. Theoretical sufficiency was reached after 23 pregnant women and 11 clinicians had been interviewed. The themes (and subthemes from which they arose) were: Theme I-Information Provision (IA-Sources of Information, IB-Standardization, IC-Constraints, ID-Role of Government); Theme II-Risk (IIA-Significant Risk, IIB-Perceived Relevance, IIC-Reconciliation); and Theme III- Factors Influencing Level of Concern (IIIA-Current Knowledge, IIIB-Demographic Factors). To respond to the increasing media and research attention regarding risk of phthalates to women, and pregnant women in particular, national professional organizations should provide patient information. This could include pamphlets on what a pregnant woman should know about phthalates and how they can be avoided, as well as information to clinicians to facilitate this discussion.",PMC4079618

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a xenoestrogen commonly used in consumer products and the plastic industry. There is evidence and an ongoing discussion that endocrine disruptors like BPA may affect human health and also exert alterations on in the immune system. The aim of this study was to investigate age-dependent effects of BPA on the asthma risk using a murine model to explain the controversial results reported till date. BALB/c mice were exposed to BPA via the drinking water for different time periods including pregnancy and breastfeeding. To induce an asthma phenotype, mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA), followed by an intrapulmonary allergen challenge. BPA exposure during pregnancy and breastfeeding had no significant effect on asthma development in the offspring. In contrast, lifelong exposure from birth until the last antigen challenge clearly increased eosinophilic inflammation in the lung, airway hyperreactivity and antigen-specific serum IgE levels in OVA-sensitized adult mice compared to mice without BPA exposure. Surprisingly, BPA intake during the sensitization period significantly reduced the development of allergic asthma. This effect was reversed in the presence of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. Our results demonstrate that the impact of BPA on asthma risk is strongly age-dependent and ranges from asthma-promoting to asthma-reducing effects. This could explain the diversity of results from previous studies regarding the observed health impact of BPA.",PMC4065062

Many EDCs elicit their toxic effects through nuclear hormone receptors, like the estrogen receptor α (ERα). In silico models can be used to prioritize chemicals for toxicological evaluation to reduce the amount of costly pharmacological testing and enable early alerts for newly designed compounds. However, many of the current computational models are overly dependent on the chemistry of known modulators and perform poorly for novel chemical scaffolds. Herein we describe the development of computational, three-dimensional multi-conformational pocket-field docking, and chemical-field docking models for the identification of novel EDCs that act via the ligand-binding domain of ERα. These models were highly accurate in the retrospective task of distinguishing known high-affinity ERα modulators from inactive or decoy molecules, with minimal training. To illustrate the utility of the models in prospective in silico compound screening, we screened a database of over 6000 environmental chemicals and evaluated the 24 top-ranked hits in an ERα transcriptional activation assay and a differential scanning fluorimetry-based ERα binding assay. Promisingly, six chemicals displayed ERα agonist activity (32nM-3.98μM) and two chemicals had moderately stabilizing effects on ERα. Two newly identified active compounds were chemically related β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonists, dobutamine, and ractopamine (a feed additive that promotes leanness in cattle and poultry), which are the first βAR agonists identified as activators of ERα-mediated gene transcription. This approach can be applied to other receptors implicated in endocrine disruption.",PMC4271121

In sheep, prenatal BPA treatment induces reproductive neuroendocrine defects, manifested as LH excess and dampened LH surge and perturbs early ovarian gene expression. In this study we hypothesized that prenatal BPA treatment will also disrupt ovarian follicular dynamics. Pregnant sheep were treated from days 30 to 90 of gestation with 3 different BPA doses (0.05, 0.5, or 5mg/kgBW/day). All female offspring were estrus synchronized and transrectal ultrasonography was performed daily for 22days to monitor ovarian follicular and corpora lutea dynamics. Blood samples were collected to assess preovulatory hormonal changes and luteal progesterone dynamics. Statistical analysis revealed that the time interval between the estradiol rise and the preovulatory LH surge was shortened in the BPA-treated females. None of the three BPA doses had an effect on corpora lutea, progestogenic cycles, and mean number or duration of ovulatory and non-ovulatory follicles. However, differences in follicular count trajectories were evident in all three follicular size classes (2-3mm, 4-5mm, and ≥6mm) of prenatal BPA-treated animals compared to controls. Number of follicular waves tended also to be more variable in the prenatal BPA-treated groups ranging from 2 to 5 follicular waves per cycle, while this was restricted to 3 to 4 waves in control females. These changes in ovarian follicular dynamics coupled with defects in time interval between estradiol rise and preovulatory LH release are likely to lead to subfertility in prenatal BPA-treated females.",PMC4134973

The mechanisms responsible for these NMDRCs are well known, typically related to the interactions between the ligand (hormone or EDC) and a hormone receptor. Although there are hundreds of examples of NMDRCs in the EDC literature, there are claims that they are not 'common enough' to influence the use of high-to-low dose extrapolations in risk assessments. Here, we chose bisphenol A (BPA), a well-studied EDC, to assess the frequency of non-monotonic responses. Our results indicate that NMDRCs are common in the BPA literature, occurring in greater than 20% of all experiments and in at least one endpoint in more than 30% of all studies we examined. We also analyzed the types of endpoints that produce NMDRCs in vitro and factors related to study design that influence the ability to detect these kinds of responses. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence for NMDRCs in the EDC literature, specifically for BPA, and question the current risk assessment practice where 'safe' low doses are predicted from high dose exposures.",PMC4036398

Large doses of DEHP disrupt normal ovarian function; however, the effects of DEHP at environmentally relevant levels, the effects of DEHP on folliculogenesis, and the mechanisms by which DEHP disrupts ovarian function are unclear. The present study tested the hypothesis that relatively low levels of DEHP disrupt estrous cyclicity as well as accelerate primordial follicle recruitment by dysregulating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Adult CD-1 mice were orally dosed with DEHP (20 μg/kg/day-750 mg/kg/day) daily for 10 and 30 days. Following dosing, the effects on estrous cyclicity were examined, and follicle numbers were histologically quantified. Further, the ovarian mRNA and protein levels of PI3K signaling factors that are associated with early folliculogenesis were quantified. The data indicate that 10- and 30-day exposure to DEHP prolonged the duration of estrus and accelerated primordial follicle recruitment. Specifically, DEHP exposure decreased the percentage of primordial follicles and increased the percentage of primary follicles counted following 10-day exposure and increased the percentage of primary follicles counted following 30-day exposure. DEHP exposure, at doses that accelerate folliculogenesis, increased the levels of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, and protein kinase B and decreased the levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog, potentially driving PI3K signaling.

The BPA doses were selected to be below the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) of 5 mg/kg/day. On postnatal days 1-21, all offspring/litter were orally treated with the same dose. A naïve control group was not gavaged. Body weight, pubertal age, estrous cyclicity, and adult serum hormone levels were measured. Adolescent play, running wheel activity, flavored solution intake, female sex behavior, and manually elicited lordosis were assessed. No significant differences existed between the vehicle and naïve control groups. Vehicle controls exhibited significant sexual dimorphism for most behaviors, indicating these evaluations were sensitive to sex differences. However, only EE2 treatment caused significant effects. Relative to female controls, EE2-treated females were heavier, exhibited delayed vaginal opening, aberrant estrous cyclicity, increased play behavior, decreased running wheel activity, and increased aggression toward the stimulus male during sexual behavior assessments. Relative to male controls, EE2-treated males were older at testes descent and preputial separation and had lower testosterone levels.

In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to different concentrations of MEHP (1.6, 8, 40, and 200 μg/L) from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 168 hpf. The whole-body content of thyroid hormone and transcription of genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were examined. Treatment with MEHP significantly decreased whole-body T4 contents and increased whole-body T3 contents, indicating thyroid endocrine disruption. The upregulation of genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism (Dio2 and UGT1ab) might be responsible for decreased T4 contents. Elevated gene transcription of Dio1 was also observed in this study, which might assist to degrade increased T3 contents. Exposure to MEHP also significantly induced transcription of genes involved in thyroid development (Nkx2.1 and Pax8) and thyroid hormone synthesis (TSHβ, NIS and TG). However, the genes encoding proteins involved in TH transport (transthyretin, TTR) was transcriptionally significantly down-regulated after exposure to MEHP.

Using a 72 h zebrafish embryo toxicity test, the LC50 values of BBP, DBP and a mixture of the six phthalates were found to be 0.72, 0.63 and 0.50 ppm, respectively. The other four phthalates did not cause more than 50% exposed embryo mortality even at their highest soluble concentrations. The typical toxicity symptoms caused by phthalates were death, tail curvature, necrosis, cardio edema and no touch response. Using an estrogen-responsive ChgH-EGFP transgenic medaka (Oryzias melastigma) eleutheroembryos based 24 h test, BBP demonstrated estrogenic activity, DBP, DEHP, DINP and the mixture of the six phthalates exhibited enhanced-estrogenic activity and DIDP and DNOP showed no enhanced- or anti-estrogenic activity. These findings highlighted the developmental toxicity of BBP and DBP, and the estrogenic endocrine disrupting activity of BBP, DBP, DEHP and DINP on intact organisms, indicating that the widespread use of these phthalates may cause potential health risks to human beings.",PMC3987027

When children were 4 and 5 years old, mothers completed the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a measure of autistic behaviors. We examined confounder-adjusted associations between 52 EDCs and SRS scores using a two-stage hierarchical analysis to account for repeated measures and confounding by correlated EDCs. Most of the EDCs were associated with negligible absolute differences in SRS scores (≤ 1.5). Each 2-SD increase in serum concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ether-28 (PBDE-28) (β = 2.5; 95% CI: -0.6, 5.6) or trans-nonachlor (β = 4.1; 95% CI: 0.8-7.3) was associated with more autistic behaviors. In contrast, fewer autistic behaviors were observed among children born to women with detectable versus nondetectable concentrations of PCB-178 (β = -3.0; 95% CI: -6.3, 0.2), β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β = -3.3; 95% CI: -6.1, -0.5), or PBDE-85 (β = -3.2; 95% CI: -5.9, -0.5). Increasing perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) concentrations were also associated with fewer autistic behaviors (β = -2.0; 95% CI: -4.4, 0.4). Some EDCs were associated with autistic behaviors in this cohort, but our modest sample size precludes us from dismissing chemicals with null associations.

The primary and interaction effects of coexisted EDCs on the adsorption of BPA and EE2 were studied in binary and multiple systems. The adsorption selectivity of sediment at different initial concentrations of EDCs was also considered, based on the distribution coefficient (β). In binary systems, coexisted EDCs exhibited a positive effect on the adsorption of BPA, while E3 showed a negative effect on the adsorption of EE2. In ternary systems, the interaction of E1*E3 and E2*BPA showed a synergistic effect on the sorption of BPA and EE2, respectively. In quaternary systems, the interaction of E1*E2*E3 showed a synergistic effect on the adsorption of both BPA and EE2. In the quinary system, coexisted EDCs all showed an antagonistic effect on the adsorption of BPA and EE2, which indicated that the coexisted EDCs competed for adsorption with BPA and EE2. EDCs in the E2-EE2-BPA system presented a superior selectivity of sediment with β values of 43.48-87.86.

Animal studies found that BPA contributes to development of prostate cancer, but human data are scarce. Our study examined the association between urinary BPA levels and Prostate cancer and assessed the effects of BPA on induction of centrosome abnormalities as an underlying mechanism promoting prostate carcinogenesis. The study, involving 60 urology patients, found higher levels of urinary BPA (creatinine-adjusted) in Prostate cancer patients (5.74 µg/g [95% CI; 2.63, 12.51]) than in non-Prostate cancer patients (1.43 µg/g [95% CI; 0.70, 2.88]) (p = 0.012). The difference was even more significant in patients <65 years old. A trend toward a negative association between urinary BPA and serum PSA was observed in Prostate cancer patients but not in non-Prostate cancer patients. In vitro studies examined centrosomal abnormalities, microtubule nucleation, and anchorage-independent growth in four Prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2, 22Rv1, PC-3) and two immortalized normal prostate epithelial cell lines (NPrEC and RWPE-1). Exposure to low doses (0.01-100 nM) of BPA increased the percentage of cells with centrosome amplification two- to eight-fold. Dose responses either peaked or reached the plateaus with 0.1 nM BPA exposure. This low dose also promoted microtubule nucleation and regrowth at centrosomes in RWPE-1 and enhanced anchorage-independent growth in C4-2. These findings suggest that urinary BPA level is an independent prognostic marker in Prostate cancer and that BPA exposure may lower serum PSA levels in Prostate cancer patients. Moreover, disruption of the centrosome duplication cycle by low-dose BPA may contribute to neoplastic transformation of the prostate.",PMC3940879

Beside E2, a class of synthetic and plant-derived chemicals collectively named endocrine disruptors (EDs) or xenoestrogens bind to and modify both nuclear and extra-nuclear ERα activities. However, at the present no information is available on the ability of EDs to hamper ERα intracellular concentration. Here, the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and naringenin (Nar), prototypes of synthetic and plant-derived ERα ligands, have been evaluated on ERα levels in MCF-7 cells. Both EDs mimic E2 in triggering ERα Ser118 phosphorylation and gene transcription. However, only E2 or BPA induce an increase of cell proliferation; whereas 24 hrs after Nar stimulation a dose-dependent decrease in cell number is reported. E2 or BPA treatment reduces ERα protein and mRNA levels after 24 hrs. Contrarily, Nar stimulation does not alter ERα content but reduces ERα mRNA levels like other ligands. Co-stimulation experiments indicate that 48 hrs of Nar treatment prevents the E2-induced ERα degradation and hijacks the physiological ability of E2:ERα complex to regulate gene transcription. Mechanistically, Nar induces ERα protein accumulation by preventing proteasomal receptor degradation via persistent activation of p38/MAPK pathway. As a whole these data demonstrate that ERα intracellular concentration is an important target through which EDs hamper the hormonal milieu of E2 target cells driving cells to different outcomes or mimicking E2 even in the absence of the hormone.",PMC3930606

Previously we reported that acute exposure to BPA promotes arrhythmogenesis in female hearts through alteration of myocyte Ca(2+) handling, and that the dose response of BPA was inverted U-shaped. We sought to define the cellular mechanism underlying the nonmonotonic dose response of BPA in the heart. We examined rapid effects of BPA in female rat ventricular myocytes using video-edge detection, confocal and conventional fluorescence imaging, and patch clamp. The rapid effects of BPA in cardiac myocytes, as measured by multiple end points, including development of arrhythmic activities, myocyte mechanics, and Ca(2+) transient, were characterized by nonmonotonic dose responses. Interestingly, the effects of BPA on individual processes of myocyte Ca(2+) handling were monotonic. Over the concentration range of 10(-12) to 10(-6) M, BPA progressively increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release and Ca(2+) reuptake and inhibited the L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)). These effects on myocyte Ca(2+) handling were mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) β signaling. The nonmonotonic dose responses of BPA can be accounted for by the combined effects of progressively increased SR Ca(2+) reuptake/release and decreased Ca(2+) influx through I(CaL). The rapid effects of BPA on female rat cardiac myocytes are characterized by nonmonotonic dose responses as measured by multiple end points. The nonmonotonic dose response was produced by ERβ-mediated monotonic effects on multiple cellular Ca(2+) handling processes. This represents a distinct mechanism underlying the nonmonotonicity of BPA's actions.",PMC4050515

Multipotent murine mesenchymal stem cells (C3H10T1/2) were exposed to EDC mixtures in high concentrations, i.e. MIX-high (10 µmol/l BPA, 100 µmol/l DEHP, 100 nmol/l TBT), and in environmentally relevant concentrations, i.e. MIX-low (10 nmol/l BPA, 100 nmol/l DEHP, 1 nmol/l TBT). The exposure was performed either for the entire culture time (0-12 days) or at distinct stages of adipogenic differentiation. At day 12 of cell culture, the amount of adipocytes, triglyceride content (TG), and adipogenic marker gene expression were analyzed. MIX-high increased the development of adipocytes and the expression of adipogenic marker genes independently of the exposure window. The total TG amount was not increased. The low-concentrated EDC mixture had no obvious impact on adipogenesis. In EDC mixtures, the adipogenic effect of TBT and DEHP predominates single effects of BPA.

We used median regression to assess the associations between urinary phthalate metabolites and fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin and Homeostatic Model Assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), controlling for urinary creatinine as well as several sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Stratified analyses were conducted to compare the gender- and race/ethnicity-specific patterns for the associations.

Aromatase enzyme converts androgen to estrogen. Thus, EDCs against aromatase significantly impact estrogen- and/or androgen-dependent functions, including the development of breast cancer. The current study aimed to develop a biologically relevant cell-based high-throughput screening assay to identify EDCs that act as aromatase inhibitors (AIs), estrogen receptor (ER) agonists, and/or ER antagonists. The AroER tri-screen assay was developed by stable transfection of ER-positive, aromatase-expressing MCF-7 breast cancer cells with an estrogen responsive element (ERE) driven luciferase reporter plasmid. The AroER tri-screen can identify: estrogenic EDCs, which increase luciferase signal without 17β-estradiol (E2); anti-estrogenic EDCs, which inhibit the E2-induced luciferase signal; and AI-like EDCs, which suppress a testosterone-induced luciferase signal. The assay was first optimized in a 96-well plate format and then miniaturized into a 1536-well plate format. The AroER tri-screen was demonstrated to be suitable for high-throughput screening in the 1536-well plate format, with a 6.9-fold signal-to-background ratio, a 5.4% coefficient of variation, and a screening window coefficient (Z-factor) of 0.78. The assay suggested that bisphenol A (BPA) functions mainly as an ER agonist. Results from screening the 446 drugs in the National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection revealed 106 compounds that modulated ER and/or aromatase activities.

Current procedures for conducting quality assessments in safety agencies are not structured, clear or consistent. This leaves room for criticism about lack of transparency, subjective influence and the potential for insufficient protection provided by resulting safety standards. We propose a tool called ""Qualichem in vivo"" that is designed to systematically and transparently assess the quality of in vivo studies used in chemical health risk assessment. We demonstrate its use here with 12 experts, using two controversial studies on Bisphenol A (BPA) that played an important role in BPA regulation in Europe. The results obtained with Qualichem contradict the quality assessments conducted by expert committees in safety agencies for both of these studies. Furthermore, they show that reliance on standardized guidelines to ensure scientific quality is only partially justified. Qualichem allows experts with different disciplinary backgrounds and professional experiences to express their individual and sometimes divergent views-an improvement over the current way of dealing with minority opinions. It provides a transparent framework for expressing an aggregated, multi-expert level of confidence in a study, and allows a simple graphical representation of how well the study integrates the best available scientific knowledge. Qualichem can be used to compare assessments of the same study by different health agencies, increasing transparency and trust in the work of expert committees.

We tested surface water samples using a transgenic zebrafish reporter with tandem estrogen response elements driving green fluorescent protein expression (5xERE:GFP). Reporter activation was colocalized with tissue-specific expression of ER genes by RNA in situ hybridization. We observed selective patterns of ER activation in transgenic fish exposed to river water samples from the Mid-Atlantic United States, with several samples preferentially activating receptors in embryonic and larval heart valves. We discovered that tissue specificity in ER activation was due to differences in the expression of ER subtypes. ERα was expressed in developing heart valves but not in the liver, whereas ERβ2 had the opposite profile. Accordingly, subtype-specific ER agonists activated the reporter in either the heart valves or the liver. The use of 5xERE:GFP transgenic zebrafish revealed an unexpected tissue-specific difference in the response to environmentally relevant estrogenic compounds. Exposure to estrogenic EEDs in utero was associated with adverse health effects, with the potentially unanticipated consequence of targeting developing heart valves.",PMC3984228

In this study, the mechanism of BPA-induced adipogenesis in preadipocytes from donors with healthy body mass index in the absence of exogenous glucocorticoid was evaluated. The effects of estradiol, the estrogen-receptor (ER) antagonist ICI and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU486 on BPA-induced adipogenesis were examined. The expression levels of key adipogenic factors were assessed. Treatment of preadipocytes with 1-50 μM BPA induced a dose-dependent increase in differentiation and lipid accumulation as determined by lipid staining and triacylglyceride quantification. BPA also induced expression of the adipogenic markers aP2, adipsin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and the CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins α and β. Co-treatment of cells with ICI inhibited the BPA-induced increase in aP2 levels, while treatment with ICI or estradiol alone had no effect. Treatment of cells with the GR antagonist RU486 had no effect on BPA-induced differentiation as evaluated by aP2 levels. This study is one of the first to show that BPA induces human adipocyte differentiation in the absence of exogenous glucocorticoid through a non-classical ER pathway rather than through GR activation.

Up to 10% of Europeans and 5% of Asians carry at least one null allele in the filaggrin gene (FLG). Reduced expression of filaggrin in carriers of the null allele is associated with facilitated transfer of allergens across the epidermis. We hypothesized that these individuals may have increased transdermal uptake of endocrine disruptors, including phthalates. We investigated urinary excretion of phthalate metabolites and testicular function in young men with and without FLG loss-of-function variants in a cross-sectional study of 861 young men from the general Danish population. All men were genotyped for FLG R501X, 2282del4, and R2447X loss-of-function variants. We measured urinary concentrations of 14 phthalate metabolites and serum levels of reproductive hormones. We also evaluated semen quality. Sixty-five men (7.5%) carried at least one FLG-null allele. FLG-null carriers had significantly higher urinary concentrations of several phthalate metabolites, including a 33% higher concentration of MnBP (mono-n-butyl phthalate; 95% CI: 16, 51%). FLG-null variants were not significantly associated with reproductive hormones or semen quality parameters. This study provides evidence that carriers of FLG loss-of-function alleles may have higher internal exposure to phthalates, possibly due to increased transepidermal absorption. FLG loss-of-function variants may indicate susceptible populations for which special attention to transepidermal absorption of chemicals and medication may be warranted.",PMC3984221

Many of these molecules can affect steroid biosynthesis or estrogen-receptor signaling by behaving as estrogen-like molecules (""xenoestrogens""), or by exerting estrogenmodulatory effects. Exposure to some compounds has been correlated with the skewing of sex ratios in aquatic species, feminization and demasculinization of male animals, declines in human sperm counts, and overall diminution in fertility of birds, fish, and mammals. We herein devote space to several classes of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), including estrogenic substances such as bisphenol A (BPA), molecules that can behave at times anti-estrogenically while activating the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), such as dioxins (a known human carcinogen), and novel, ubiquitous molecules such as nanoparticles, particularly gold nanoparticles (GNPs), that appear to alter the sexsteroid biosynthetic pathway.",PMC4364387

Since foetal testis is known as one of the most sensitive targets of EDs, phthalate risk assessment is routinely based on the capacity of such compounds to decrease testosterone production by the testis or to impair masculinization in the rat during foetal life. In this paper, the well-established inhibiting effects of phthalates of the foetal Leydig cells function in the rat are briefly reviewed. Then, data obtained in humans and other species are carefully analysed. Already in January 2009, using the organotypic culture system named Fetal Testis Assay (FeTA) that we developed, we reported that phthalates might not affect testosterone production in human foetal testes. Several recent experimental studies using xenografts confirm the absence of detectable anti-androgenic effect of phthalates in the human foetal testes. Epidemiological studies led to contradictory results. Altogether, these findings suggest that phthalates effects on foetal Leydig cells are largely species-specific. Consequently, the phthalate threshold doses that disturb foetal steroidogenesis in rat testes and that are presently used to define the acceptable daily intake levels for human health protection must be questioned. This does not mean that phthalates are safe because these compounds have many deleterious effects upon germ cell development that may be common to the different studied species including human. More generally, the identification of common molecular, cellular or/and phenotypic targets in rat and human testes should precede the choice of the toxicological endpoint in rat to accurately assess the safety threshold of any ED in humans.",PMC4349750

However, the metabolism of BPAF in vivo and the estrogenic activity of its metabolites remain unknown. In the present study, we identified four metabolites including BPAF diglucuronide, BPAF glucuronide (BPAF-G), BPAF glucuronide dehydrated and BPAF sulfate in the urine of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. BPAF-G was further characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). After treatment with a single dose of BPAF, BPAF was metabolized rapidly to BPAF-G, as detected in the plasma of SD rats. Biotransformation of BPAF to BPAF-G was confirmed with human liver microsomes (HLM), and Vmax of glucuronidation for HLM was 11.6 nmol/min/mg. We also found that BPAF glucuronidation could be mediated through several human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, UGT2B4, UGT2B7, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, among which UGT2B7 showed the highest efficiency of glucuronidation. To explain the biological function of BPAF biotransformation, the estrogenic activities of BPAF and BPAF-G were evaluated in ER-positive breast cancer T47D and MCF7 cells. BPAF significantly stimulates ER-regulated gene expression and cell proliferation at the dose of 100 nM and 1 μM in breast cancer cells. However, BPAF-G did not show any induction of estrogenic activity at the same dosages, implying that formation of BPAF-G is a potential host defense mechanism against BPAF. Based on our study, biotransformation of BPAF to BPAF-G can eliminate BPAF-induced estrogenic activity, which is therefore considered as reducing the potential threat to human beings.",PMC3862725

The identification of the classical receptors ERα and ERβ and the transmembrane receptor GPER and the resolution of the structure of the ligand bound to its receptor established the principal molecular mechanisms of estrogen action. The presence of estrogen-like compounds in many plants used in traditional medicine or ingested as food ingredients, phytoestrogens, as well as the estrogenic activities of many industrial pollutants and pesticides, xenoestrogens, have prompted investigations into their role in human health. Phyto- and xenoestrogens bind to the estrogen receptors with a lower affinity than the endogenous estrogens and can compete or substitute the hormone. Xenoestrogens, which accumulate in the body throughout life, are believed to increase breast cancer risk, especially in cases of prenatal and prepuberal exposure whereas the role of phytoestrogens is still a matter of debate. At present, the application of phytoestrogens appears to be limited to the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms in women where the production of endogenous estrogens has ceased. In this review we discuss chemistry, structure and classification, estrogen signaling and the consequences of the interactions of estrogens, phytoestrogens and xenoestrogens with their receptors, the complex interactions of endogenous and exogenous ligands, the evaluation of the health risks related to xenoestrogens, and the perspectives toward the synthesis of potent third generation selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).",PMC4153070

We tested the hypothesis that prenatal treatment of rats with low doses of Aroclor 1221 (A1221), a weakly estrogenic polychlorinated biphenyl mix previously used in industry, or estradiol benzoate (EB), alters development of the hypothalamus in a sexually dimorphic manner and subsequently perturbs reproductive function. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected on embryonic days 16 and 18 with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide), A1221 (1 mg/kg), or EB (50 μg/kg). Developmental milestones were monitored, and on postnatal days 15, 30, 45, and 90, 1 male and 1 female per litter were euthanized. Because of their key roles in the mediation of steroid actions on reproductive function, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC) were punched for a low-density quantitative PCR array of 48 neuroendocrine genes and analysis of DNA methylation of a subset of genes. Gestational exposure to A1221 or EB delayed the timing of puberty in males and disrupted estrous cyclicity in females. In the AVPV, 28 genes were affected by treatment in a developmental stage-specific manner, mostly in females, which exhibited a masculinized expression profile. This included 2 clock genes, Per2 and Arntl, implicating circadian circuits as being vulnerable to endocrine disruption. DNA methylation analysis of 2 genes, Per2 and Ar, showed no effect of EDCs and suggested alternative mechanisms for the altered mRNA levels. In the ARC, 12 genes were affected by treatment, mostly in males, again with dynamic developmental changes.

A number of EDCs, including bisphenol A (BPA) can bind to the estrogen receptors (ER), ERα and ERβ, and may contribute to estrogen-linked diseases such as breast cancer. Early exposure is of particular concern; many EDCs cross the placenta and infants have measurable levels of, eg, BPA. In addition, infants are frequently fed soy-based formula (SF) that contains phytoestrogens. Effects of combined exposure to xeno- and phytoestrogens are poorly studied. Here, we extensively compared to what extent BPA, genistein, and an extract of infant SF mimic estrogen-induced gene transcription and cell proliferation. We investigated ligand-specific effects on ER activation in HeLa-ERα and ERβ reporter cells; on proliferation, genome-wide gene regulation and non-ER-mediated effects in MCF7 breast cancer cells; and how coexposure influenced these effects. The biological relevance was explored using enrichment analyses of differentially regulated genes and clustering with clinical breast cancer profiles. We demonstrate that coexposure to BPA and genistein, or SF, results in increased functional and transcriptional estrogenic effects. Using statistical modeling, we determine that BPA and phytoestrogens act in an additive manner. The proliferative and transcriptional effects of the tested compounds mimic those of 17β-estradiol, and are abolished by cotreatment with an ER antagonist. Gene expression profiles induced by each compound clustered with poor prognosis breast cancer, indicating that exposure may adversely affect breast cancer prognosis.

We measured lipid-based and WHO2005-TEQ (toxic equivalents established in 2005 by the World Health Organization)-standardized PCDD/Fs and PCBs in maternal blood samples and in early breast milk using gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. At the child's age of 6-8 years, parents (mostly mothers) reported sex-typical characteristics, preferred toys, and play activities using the Pre-School Activities Inventory (PSAI), which was used to derive feminine, masculine, and difference (feminine - masculine) scores. We estimated exposure-outcome associations using multivariate linear regression. A total of 91-109 children were included in this follow-up. Mean blood levels of summed WHO2005-TEQ-standardized dioxins (ΣPCDD/Fs) were 14.5 ± 6.4 pg/g blood lipids, and ΣPCBs were 6.9 ± 3.8 pg/g blood lipids, with similar values for milk lipids.

To evaluate this hypothesis, a screening system for obesogenic compounds is urgently needed. In this study, we suggest a standardised protocol for obesogen screening based on the 3T3-L1 cell line, a well-characterised adipogenesis model, and direct fluorescent measurement using Nile red lipid staining technique. In a first phase, we characterised the assay using the acknowledged obesogens rosiglitazone and tributyltin. Based on the obtained dose-response curves for these model compounds, a lipid accumulation threshold value was calculated to ensure the biological relevance and reliability of statistically significant effects. This threshold based method was combined with the well described strictly standardized mean difference (SSMD) method for classification of non-, weak- or strong obesogenic compounds. In the next step, a range of EDCs, used in personal and household care products (parabens, musks, phthalates and alkylphenol compounds), were tested to further evaluate the obesogenicity screening assay for its discriminative power and sensitivity. Additionally, the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) dependency of the positive compounds was evaluated using PPARγ activation and antagonist experiments. Our results showed the adipogenic potential of all tested parabens, several musks and phthalate compounds and bisphenol A (BPA).

However, although often found in both male and female reproductive fluids, its effects on human spermatozoa function are not known. Normozoospermic sperm samples from healthy individuals were included in this study. Samples were exposed to several p,p'-DDE concentrations for 3 days at 37°C and 5% CO2 in vitro to mimic the putative continuous exposure to this toxicant in the female reproductive tract in vivo. Shorter p,p'-DDE incubation periods were also performed in order to monitor sperm rapid Ca(2+) responses. All experiments were repeated on a minimum of five sperm samples from different individuals. All healthy individuals were recruited at the Biosciences School, University of Birmingham, the Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee and in the Human Reproduction Service at University Hospitals of Coimbra. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was monitored by imaging single spermatozoa loaded with Oregon Green BAPTA-1AM and further whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed to validate our results. Sperm viability and acrosomal integrity were assessed using the LIVE/DEAD sperm vitality kit and the acrosomal content marker PSA-FITC, respectively. p,p'-DDE rapidly increased [Ca(2+)]i (P < 0.05) even at extremely low doses (1 pM and 1 nM), with magnitudes of response up to 200%, without affecting sperm viability, except after 3 days of continuous exposure to the highest concentration tested (P < 0.05). Furthermore, experiments performed in a low Ca(2+) medium demonstrated that extracellular Ca(2+) influx was responsible for this Ca(2+) increase (P < 0.01). Mibefradil and NNC 55-0396, both inhibitors of the sperm-specific CatSper channel, reversed the p,p'-DDE-induced [Ca(2+)]i rise, suggesting the participation of CatSper in this process (P < 0.05). In fact, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings confirmed CatSper as a target of p,p'-DDE action by monitoring an increase in CatSper currents of >100% (P < 0.01). Finally, acrosomal integrity was adversely affected after 2 days of exposure to p,p'-DDE concentrations, suggesting that [Ca(2+)]i rise may cause premature acrosome reaction (P < 0.05).

Previous studies indicate that other EDCs have species-dependent effects. Furthermore, some EDCs are known to have different effects in different strains within the same species. Little information, however, is known about whether the effects of BPA on the ovary differ by strain. Previous studies have shown that BPA inhibits follicle growth, induces atresia, and inhibits steroidogenesis and expression of steroidogenic enzymes in antral follicles from adult FVB mice. Thus, this study was designed to expand previous work by testing the hypothesis that mouse strain may differentially affect the susceptibility of adult antral follicles to BPA-induced toxicity. To test this hypothesis, antral follicles were mechanically isolated from adult FVB, CD-1, and C57BL/6 mice, individually cultured for 6-120 h and treated with either vehicle control (dimethylsulfoxide) or various concentrations of BPA (1.0 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml, or 100 μg/ml). After culture, media were subjected to measurements of hormone production via ELISA, and follicles were subjected to real-time PCR for analysis of genes known to regulate steroidogenesis, the cell cycle, and atresia. Overall, BPA inhibited follicle growth and steroidogenesis in all tested strains, but CD-1 follicles were slightly more sensitive to BPA at early time points than FVB and C57BL/6 follicles. These data suggest that CD-1, FVB, and C57BL/6 mice can all be used to investigate the effects of BPA on ovarian follicles.",PMC4076378

Recent reports provide evidence for the presence of EDCs in commercially available bottled water, including steroid receptor agonists and antagonists. However, since these findings are based on biological data the causative chemicals remain unidentified and, therefore, inaccessible for toxicological evaluation. Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activity of bottled water and to identify the causative steroid receptor antagonists. We evaluated the antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activity of 18 bottled water products in reporter gene assays for human estrogen receptor alpha and androgen receptor. Using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos), we acquired corresponding analytical data. We combined the biological and chemical information to determine the exact mass of the tentative steroid receptor antagonist. Further MS(n) experiments elucidated the molecule's structure and enabled its identification. We detected significant antiestrogenicity in 13 of 18 products. 16 samples were antiandrogenic inhibiting the androgen receptor by up to 90%. Nontarget chemical analysis revealed that out of 24520 candidates present in bottled water one was consistently correlated with the antagonistic activity. By combining experimental and in silico MS(n) data we identified this compound as di(2-ethylhexyl) fumarate (DEHF). We confirmed the identity and biological activity of DEHF and additional isomers of dioctyl fumarate and maleate using authentic standards. Since DEHF is antiestrogenic but not antiandrogenic we conclude that additional, yet unidentified EDCs must contribute to the antagonistic effect of bottled water. Applying a novel approach to combine biological and chemical analysis this is the first study to identify so far unknown EDCs in bottled water. Notably, dioctyl fumarates and maleates have been overlooked by science and regulation to date. This illustrates the need to identify novel toxicologically relevant compounds to establish a more holistic picture of the human exposome.",PMC3756062

As the actions of steroids are mediated through the binding of steroid receptors, most studies of EDCs have assumed that they too elicit their effects by binding steroid receptors. We tested an alternative hypothesis, namely that EDCs elicit their effects during embryonic development by disrupting the metabolism of maternally derived steroids, thereby allowing maternally derived steroids to bind steroid receptors and elicit effects. Specifically, we examined the ability of the EDC, bisphenol-A (BPA) to inhibit the normal metabolism of oestradiol during the first nine days of embryonic development in the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). We found that, when BPA was present, oestrogen metabolism was inhibited when compared to control eggs. In particular, the formation of oestrone sulfate was blocked in BPA-treated eggs. We postulate that the oestrogenic effects of EDCs may be driven, at least in part, by inappropriate oestrogen signalling. The retention of oestrogens at points of development when they would normally be metabolized to inactive forms might also help explain low-dose effects frequently reported for EDCs.",PMC3768319
23967237,"Iuliia Savchuk, Olle Söder, Konstantin Svechnikov",Mouse leydig cells with different androgen production potential are resistant to estrogenic stimuli but responsive to bisphenol a which attenuates testosterone metabolism.,2013,"It is well known that estrogens and estrogen-like endocrine disruptors can suppress steroidogenic gene expression, attenuate androgen production and decrease differentiation of adult Leydig cell lineage. However, there is no information about the possible link between the potency of Leydig cells to produce androgens and their sensitivity to estrogenic stimuli. Thus, the present study explored the relationship between androgen production potential of Leydig cells and their responsiveness to estrogenic compounds. To investigate this relationship we selected mouse genotypes contrasting in sex hormone levels and differing in testosterone/estradiol (T/E2) ratio. We found that two mouse genotypes, CBA/Lac and C57BL/6j have the highest and the lowest serum T/E2 ratio associated with increased serum LH level in C57BL/6j compared to CBA/Lac. Analysis of steroidogenic gene expression demonstrated significant upregulation of Cyp19 gene expression but coordinated suppression of LHR, StAR, 3βHSDI and Cyp17a1 in Leydig cells from C57BL/6j that was associated with attenuated androgen production in basal and hCG-stimulated conditions compared to CBA/Lac mice. These genotype-dependent differences in steroidogenesis were not linked to changes in the expression of estrogen receptors ERα and Gpr30, while ERβ expression was attenuated in Leydig cells from C57BL/6j compared to CBA/Lac. No effects of estrogenic agonists on steroidogenesis in Leydig cells from both genotypes were found. In contrast, xenoestrogen bisphenol A significantly potentiated hCG-activated androgen production by Leydig cells from C57BL/6j and CBA/Lac mice by suppressing conversion of testosterone into corresponding metabolite 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol. All together our data indicate that developing mouse Leydig cells with different androgen production potential are resistant to estrogenic stimuli, while xenoestrogen BPA facilitates hCG-induced steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig cells via attenuation of testosterone metabolism. This cellular event can cause premature maturation of Leydig cells that may create abnormal intratesticular paracrine milieu and disturb proper development of germ cells.",PMC3744456

This study examined sex differences in the association of urinary level of bisphenol-A (BPA) with selected indices of glucose homeostasis among U.S. adults. Data analyses were performed using a sample of 1586 participants from the 2005 to 2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. BPA level and the ratio of BPA-to-creatinine level were defined as log-transformed variables and in quartiles. Selected indices of glucose homeostasis were defined using fasting glucose and insulin data. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models for the hypothesized relationships were constructed after controlling for age, sex, race, education, marital status, smoking status, physical activity, total dietary intake, and urinary creatinine concentration. Taking the first quartile as a referent, the third quartile of BPA level was positively associated with log-transformed level of insulin and β-cell function (homeostasis model assessment for β-cell function) as well as insulin resistance (log-transformed homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance; homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance ≥2.5), with significant BPA-by-sex interaction; these associations were stronger among males than among females. Irrespective of sex, the ratio of BPA-to-creatinine level was not predictive of indices of glucose homeostasis. A complex association may exist between BPA and hyperinsulinemia among adult U.S. men.

We hypothesized that low doses of BPA inhibit follicular growth and decrease estradiol levels through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. Antral follicles from wild-type and Ahr knock-out (AhrKO) mice were cultured for 96h. Follicle diameters and estradiol levels then were compared in wild-type and AhrKO follicles ± BPA (0.004-438μM). BPA inhibited follicle growth (110-438μM) and decreased estradiol levels (43.8-438μM) in wild-type and AhrKO follicles. However, at BPA 110μM, inhibition of growth in AhrKO follicles was attenuated compared to wild-type follicles. These data suggest that BPA may inhibit follicle growth partially via the AHR pathway, whereas its effects on estradiol synthesis likely involve other mechanisms.",PMC3836856

It is unknown whether digit ratios are modified by environmental exposure to ubiquitous endocrine disruptors. We studied the effect on adult male Wistar rat digit ratios of a gestational exposure to the oestrogenic and antiandrogenic compounds bisphenol A (BPA), genistein and vinclozolin, in low doses, and in combination with investigating in parallel a possible sexual dimorphism of this trait. We also investigated the effects on the male progeny not exposed during gestation. X-rays were taken of the left and right forepaws, and 2D-5D proximal to distal phalanx distances were measured by a standardized procedure based on semi-automatic image analysis. We provide evidence that there is a sexual dimorphism of digit ratios in the Wistar rat, and we found that BPA alone or in combination with genistein and vinclozolin significantly feminized digit ratios in male rats. Intriguingly, significant feminization of digit ratios was also found in the unexposed male progeny of males that had been exposed to compound mixtures. In conclusion, prenatal environmental levels of endocrine-active substances permanently disrupt digit ratios. Digit ratio measurement in adults is thus a promising biomarker of prenatal exposure to low-dose endocrine disruptors in rodents, with potential implications for future studies in humans.",PMC3757980

We found that PCBs activate AR transcriptional activity and that this effect is potentiated by the demethylase Jarid1b, a histone demethylase that catalyzes the removal of trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me3), induced by PCB. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the treatment of cultured cells (HEK293) with a mixture of the most diffused environmental PCBs and, also with dihydrotestosterone (DHT), on the functional interaction between AR and Jarid1b. Although the effect induced by DHT on the AR transactivation was considerably higher, the PCB mixture produced an AR-mediated transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Cotransfection with plasmids expressing Jarid1b and various AR isoforms containing polyglutamine tracts (polyQ tracts) of different lengths showed that Jarid1b potentiates the AR transcriptional activity induced by PCBs but only with the shortest AR isoform. The potentiating effect of Jarid1b on the AR is mediated by a direct interaction of the enzyme with the AR promoter. In fact, utilizing constructs containing AR promoters with a different length and a luciferase reporter gene, we showed that the effect of PCBs, but not of DHT, needs the presence of Jarid1b and of at least two DNA binding sites for Jarid1b.",PMC3891687

Adult male mice were administered food containing 0%, 0.01% or 0.1% DEHP and then testes were analyzed. The results showed that a slight but significant spermatogenic disturbance appeared in the 0.1% DEHP group but not in the 0.01% DEHP group at 8 weeks.

Pharmaceuticals are designed to alter physiology at low doses and so can be particularly potent contaminants. The near extinction of Asian vultures following exposure to diclofenac is the key example where exposure to a pharmaceutical caused a population-level impact on non-target wildlife.

Dams were exposed to physiologically relevant levels of BPA in drinking water starting 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing until weaning of offspring. EAE was induced in adult offspring. No significant changes in EAE incidence, progression, or severity were observed with BPA exposure, despite changes in cytokine production by autoreactive T cells.

In several cell culture and animal models, As acts as an endocrine disruptor, which may underlie many of its health effects. Previous work showed that steroid receptor (SR)-driven gene expression is disrupted in cells treated with inorganic As (arsenite, iAs(+3)). In those studies, low iAs(+3) concentrations (0.1-0.7 μM) stimulated hormone-inducible transcription, whereas somewhat higher but still non-cytotoxic levels (1-3 μM) inhibited transcription. This investigation focuses on the mechanisms underlying these inhibitory effects and evaluates the role of methylated trivalent As metabolites on SR function. Recent evidence suggests that, compared with iAs, methylated forms may have distinct biochemical effects. Here, fluorescence polarization (FP) experiments utilizing purified, hormone-bound human glucocorticoid (GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) have demonstrated that neither inorganic (iAs(+3)) nor dimethylated (DMA(+3)) species of trivalent As affect receptor interactions with glucocorticoid DNA response elements (GREs). However, monomethylated forms (monomethylarsenite, MMA(+3) and monomethylarsonic diglutathione, MADG) strongly inhibit GR-GRE and PR-GRE binding. Additionally, speciation studies of iAs(+3)-treated H4IIE rat hepatoma cells show that, under treatment conditions that cause inhibition of hormone-inducible gene transcription, the intracellular concentration of MADG is sufficient to inhibit GR-GRE and PR-GRE interactions in vivo. These results indicate that arsenic's inhibitory endocrine disruption effects are probably caused in part by methylated metabolites' disruption of SR ability to bind DNA response elements that are crucial to hormone-driven gene transcription.",PMC3884051

Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, and luciferase reporter assays revealed increased expression of enamelin but decreased expression of kallikrein 4 (protease essential for removing enamel proteins) via transcriptional regulation. Data suggest that BPA exerts its effects on amelogenesis by disrupting normal protein removal from the enamel matrix. Interestingly, in 100-day-old rats, erupting incisor enamel was normal, suggesting amelogenesis is only sensitive to MIH-causing agents during a specific time window during development (as reported for human MIH).

The expression of phospho-Akt protein was increased in the groups treated with BPA or DEHP compared to the control group at 72 h (P<0.05), while no significant elevation in the expression of phospho-Akt was observed (P>0.05) in genistein-treated groups. Cells were arrested at the G2/M phase by genistein. Similar effects were observed in the E2 group with or without genistein treatment. Akt protein expression had no significant change among all the groups (P>0.05). In conclusion, estradiol- or environmental endocrine disruptor-induced proliferation of human neuroblastoma cells is effectively abolished by genistein, likely in a cell cycle- and Akt pathway-dependent manner.",PMC3678847

Late gestation is characterized by active differentiation of secretory cells in the lung epithelium. We evaluated the hypothesis that BPA exposure disrupts epithelial secretory cell development in the fetal conducting airway of the rhesus macaque. We exposed animals to BPA during either the second (early term) or the third (late term) trimester. There were four treatment groups: a) sham control early term, b) sham control late term, c) BPA early term (BPA-early), and d) BPA late term (BPA-late). Because cellular maturation occurs nonuniformly in the lung, we defined mRNA and protein expression by airway level using microdissection. BPA exposure of the dam during late term significantly accelerated secretory cell maturation in the proximal airways of the fetus; both Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP) and MUC5AC/5B mRNA and protein expression increased. BPA exposure during late gestation accelerates secretory cell maturation in the proximal conducting airways. We identified a critical window of fetal susceptibility for BPA effects on lung epithelial cell maturation in the third trimester. This is of environmental health importance because increases in airway mucins are hallmarks of a number of childhood lung diseases that may be affected by BPA exposure.",PMC3734491

Molluscs are reported to be highly susceptible to effects caused by very low concentrations of environmental estrogens which, if substantiated, would have a major impact on the risk assessment of many chemicals. The present paper describes the most thorough evaluation to-date of the susceptibility of Marisa cornuarietis ER and ERR gene transcription to modulation by vertebrate estrogens in vivo and in vitro. We investigated the effects of estradiol-17β and 4-tert-Octylphenol exposure on in vivo estrogen receptor (ER) and estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gene transcription in the reproductive and neural tissues of the gastropod snail M. cornuarietis over a 12-week period. There was no significant effect (p>0.05) of treatment on gene transcription levels between exposed and non-exposed snails. Absence of a direct interaction of estradiol-17β and 4-tert-Octylphenol with mollusc ER and ERR protein was also supported by in vitro studies in transfected HEK-293 cells. Additional in vitro studies with a selection of other potential ligands (including methyl-testosterone, 17α-ethinylestradiol, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, diethylstilbestrol, cyproterone acetate and ICI182780) showed no interaction when tested using this assay. In repeated in vitro tests, however, genistein (with mcER-like) and bisphenol-A (with mcERR) increased reporter gene expression at high concentrations only (>10(-6)M for Gen and >10(-5)M for BPA, respectively). Like vertebrate estrogen receptors, the mollusc ER protein bound to the consensus vertebrate estrogen-response element (ERE). Together, these data provide no substantial evidence that mcER-like and mcERR activation and transcript levels in tissues are modulated by the vertebrate estrogen estradiol-17β or 4-tert-Octylphenol in vivo, or that other ligands of vertebrate ERs and ERRs (with the possible exception of genistein and bisphenol A, respectively) would do otherwise.",PMC3778743

A large number of natural or synthetic chemicals present in the environment and diet can interfere with estrogen signaling; these chemicals are called endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) or xenoestrogens. Some of these compounds have been shown to induce adverse effects on human and animal health, and some compounds are suspected to contribute to diverse disease development. Because xenoestrogens have varying sources and structures and could act in additive or synergistic effects when combined, they have multiple mechanisms of action. Consequently, an important panel of in vivo and in vitro bioassays and chemical analytical tools was used to screen, evaluate, and characterize the potential impacts of these compounds on humans and animals. In this paper, we discuss different molecular actions of some of the major xenoestrogens found in food or the environment, and we summarize the current models used to evaluate environmental estrogens.",PMC3659515

BPA, nonylphenol (NP), and octylphenol (OP) in colostrums were quantified with LC/MS/MS. Information for environmental exposure sources of the phenols was obtained by questionnaires. As results, median level of BPA in colostrums was 7.8 ng/mL, while most NP or OP was not detected. Regarding health risks of phenols, levels of total NP in colostrums were elevated among sick mothers with toxemia, thyroid disorders, gastritis, and so forth than health mothers (3.51 ± 4.98 versus 2.04 ± 3.71 ng/mL, P = 0.02). Dairy products intake and detergents use were positively correlated with total BPA levels (Ps < 0.05).

Increasing evidence indicates that in utero BPA exposure affects sexual differentiation and behavior; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. We hypothesized that BPA may disrupt epigenetic programming of gene expression in the brain. Here, we provide evidence that maternal exposure during pregnancy to environmentally relevant doses of BPA (2, 20, and 200 µg/kg/d) in mice induces sex-specific, dose-dependent (linear and curvilinear), and brain region-specific changes in expression of genes encoding estrogen receptors (ERs; ERα and ERβ) and estrogen-related receptor-γ in juvenile offspring. Concomitantly, BPA altered mRNA levels of epigenetic regulators DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and DNMT3A in the juvenile cortex and hypothalamus, paralleling changes in estrogen-related receptors. Importantly, changes in ERα and DNMT expression in the cortex (males) and hypothalamus (females) were associated with DNA methylation changes in the ERα gene. BPA exposure induced persistent, largely sex-specific effects on social and anxiety-like behavior, leading to disruption of sexually dimorphic behaviors. Although postnatal maternal care was altered in mothers treated with BPA during pregnancy, the effects of in utero BPA were not found to be mediated by maternal care. However, our data suggest that increased maternal care may partially attenuate the effects of in utero BPA on DNA methylation. Overall, we demonstrate that low-dose prenatal BPA exposure induces lasting epigenetic disruption in the brain that possibly underlie enduring effects of BPA on brain function and behavior, especially regarding sexually dimorphic phenotypes.",PMC3683772

The most widely utilized of reporters is the firefly luciferase (luc) gene; however, it generates light only upon addition of a chemical substrate, thus only generating intermittent single time point data snapshots. To overcome this disadvantage, we have demonstrated substrate-independent bioluminescent imaging using an optimized bacterial bioluminescence (lux) system. The lux reporter produces bioluminescence autonomously using components found naturally within the cell, thereby allowing imaging to occur continuously and in real-time over the lifetime of the host. We have validated this technology in human cells with demonstrated chemical toxicological profiling against exotoxin exposures at signal strengths comparable to existing luc systems (~1.33 × 107 photons/second). As a proof-in-principle demonstration, we have engineered breast carcinoma cells to express bioluminescence for real-time screening of endocrine disrupting chemicals and validated detection of 17β-estradiol (EC50 = ~ 10 pM).

The placenta is expected to be an effective barrier protecting the developing embryo against some endocrine disruptors (EDs) circulating in maternal blood. The current study was designed to assess in utero exposure levels of non-persistent organic pollutants (non-POPs) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Chinese newborns and potential role of placenta barrier against fetal exposure to these commonly-used environmental endocrine disruptors. A total of 230 newborn-mother pairs were enrolled during 2010-2011, 201 pairs of which were recruited from Shanghai, and the other 29 pairs came from Wenzhou. Maternal blood, cord blood, and meconium specimens were collected in the subject population from Shanghai and analyzed for non-POPs, including mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), octylphenol (OP) and 4-nonylphenol (4-NP). A total of 19 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) congeners, which belong to POPs, were detected in maternal and cord blood specimens from the other 29 pairs. Fetal-maternal ratios (F-M ratios) and regression coefficients were presented to assess potential function of placenta on barricading the mother/fetal transfer of these EDs. Concentrations of the detected non-POPs in cord blood samples were approximately 20% lower than those in maternal blood, and regression coefficients of which were all over 0.80. In contrast, PBDEs levels in cord blood samples were significantly higher than those in maternal blood. MEHP levels in meconium were much higher than those in cord blood samples, and highly correlated. Therefore, observations demonstrated that the placental barrier slightly decreased the fetal exposure to most non-POPs, while PBDEs seemed to be totally transferred across the placenta and finally reached the fetus. For in utero exposure assessment of Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), MEHP level in meconium may be a useful biomarker.",PMC3646826

One compound of concern, to which humans are widely exposed, is bisphenol A (BPA). In model organisms, BPA exposure is linked to metabolic disorders, infertility, cancer, and behavior anomalies. Recently, BPA exposure has been linked to DNA methylation changes, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms may be relevant. We investigated effects of exposure on genomic imprinting in the mouse as imprinted genes are regulated by differential DNA methylation and aberrant imprinting disrupts fetal, placental, and postnatal development. Through allele-specific and quantitative real-time PCR analysis, we demonstrated that maternal BPA exposure during late stages of oocyte development and early stages of embryonic development significantly disrupted imprinted gene expression in embryonic day (E) 9.5 and 12.5 embryos and placentas. The affected genes included Snrpn, Ube3a, Igf2, Kcnq1ot1, Cdkn1c, and Ascl2; mutations and aberrant regulation of these genes are associated with imprinting disorders in humans. Furthermore, the majority of affected genes were expressed abnormally in the placenta. DNA methylation studies showed that BPA exposure significantly altered the methylation levels of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) including the Snrpn imprinting control region (ICR) and Igf2 DMR1. Moreover, exposure significantly reduced genome-wide methylation levels in the placenta, but not the embryo. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed that these epigenetic defects were associated with abnormal placental development. In contrast to this early exposure paradigm, exposure outside of the epigenetic reprogramming window did not cause significant imprinting perturbations. Our data suggest that early exposure to common environmental compounds has the potential to disrupt fetal and postnatal health through epigenetic changes in the embryo and abnormal development of the placenta.",PMC3616904

Previous work has shown that gestational exposure to PCBs cause changes in reproductive neuroendocrine processes. Here we extended work farther down the life spectrum and tested the hypothesis that early life exposure to Aroclor 1221 (A1221), a mixture of primarily estrogenic PCBs, results in sexually dimorphic aging-associated alterations to reproductive parameters in rats, and gene expression changes in hypothalamic nuclei that regulate reproductive function. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were injected on gestational days 16 and 18 with vehicle (dimethylsulfoxide), A1221 (1 mg/kg), or estradiol benzoate (50 μg/kg). Developmental parameters, estrous cyclicity (females), and timing of reproductive senescence were monitored in the offspring through 9 months of age. Expression of 48 genes was measured in 3 hypothalamic nuclei: the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), arcuate nucleus (ARC), and median eminence (females only) by real-time RT-PCR. Serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol were assayed in the same animals. In males, A1221 had no effects; however, prenatal estradiol benzoate increased serum estradiol, gene expression in the AVPV (1 gene), and ARC (2 genes) compared with controls. In females, estrous cycles were longer in the A1221-exposed females throughout the life cycle. Gene expression was not affected in the AVPV, but significant changes were caused by A1221 in the ARC and median eminence as a function of cycling status. Bionetwork analysis demonstrated fundamental differences in physiology and gene expression between cycling and acyclic females independent of treatment. Thus, gestational exposure to biologically relevant levels of estrogenic endocrine-disrupting chemicals has sexually dimorphic effects, with an altered transition to reproductive aging in female rats but relatively little effect in males.",PMC3740483

Because of its estrogenic properties, there is increasing concern relative to risks from exposures during critical periods of early organ differentiation. Prenatal BPA treatment in sheep results in low birth weight, hypergonadotropism, and ovarian cycle disruptions. This study tested the hypothesis that gestational exposure to bisphenol A, at an environmentally relevant dose, induces early perturbations in the ovarian transcriptome (mRNA and microRNA). Pregnant Suffolk ewes were treated with bisphenol A (0.5 mg/kg, sc, daily, produced ∼2.6 ng/mL of unconjugated BPA in umbilical arterial samples of BPA treated fetuses approaching median levels of BPA measured in maternal circulation) from days 30 to 90 of gestation. Expression of steroidogenic enzymes, steroid/gonadotropin receptors, key ovarian regulators, and microRNA biogenesis components were measured by RT-PCR using RNA derived from fetal ovaries collected on gestational days 65 and 90. An age-dependent effect was evident in most steroidogenic enzymes, steroid receptors, and key ovarian regulators. Prenatal BPA increased Cyp19 and 5α-reductase expression in day 65, but not day 90, ovaries. Fetal ovarian microRNA expression was altered by prenatal BPA with 45 down-regulated (>1.5-fold) at day 65 and 11 down-regulated at day 90 of gestation. These included microRNAs targeting Sry-related high-mobility-group box (SOX) family genes, kit ligand, and insulin-related genes.

Urinary concentrations of TCS, BP-3, and 25-DCP were higher than among women of reproductive age in the US general population, while concentrations of BPA, 24-DCP, and parabens were similar. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) varied widely between biomarkers; BPA had the lowest ICC (0.24) and BP-3 had the highest (0.62), followed by 25-DCP (0.49) and TCS (0.47).

Rat hearts were subjected to 20 min of global ischemia followed by reperfusion. In female, but not male hearts, acute exposure to 1 nM BPA, either alone or combined with 1 nM 17β-estradiol (E2), during reperfusion resulted in a marked increase in the duration of sustained ventricular arrhythmias. BPA plus E2 increased the duration ventricular fibrillation, and the duration of VF as a fraction of total duration of sustained ventricular arrhythmia. The pro-arrhythmic effects of estrogens were abolished by MPP combined with PHTPP, suggesting the involvements of both ERα and ERβ signaling.

Changes in female mate discrimination were not tightly linked to changes in male phenotypic traits, suggesting that EDC exposure may alter female choice thresholds independently of the effects of exposure on males. These findings indicate that environmental exposure to EDCs can lead to population declines via the erosion of species boundaries and by promoting the establishment and spread of non-native species via hybridization.",PMC3552407

Some rodent studies have suggested that BPA can exert detrimental effects on brain development. However as rodent models cannot be relied on to predict consequences of human exposure to BPA during development, it is important to investigate the effects of BPA on non-human primate brain development. Previous research suggests that BPA preferentially targets dopamine neurons in ventral mesencephalon and glutamatergic neurons in hippocampus, so the present work examined the susceptibility of these systems to low dose BPA exposure at the fetal and juvenile stages of development in non-human primates. Exposure of pregnant rhesus monkeys to relatively low levels of BPA during the final 2 months of gestation, induced abnormalities in fetal ventral mesencephalon and hippocampus. Specifically, light microscopy revealed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing (dopamine) neurons in the midbrain of BPA-exposed fetuses and electron microscopy identified a reduction in spine synapses in the CA1 region of hippocampus. In contrast, administration of BPA to juvenile vervet monkeys (14-18 months of age) was without effect on these indices, or on dopamine and serotonin concentrations in striatum and prefrontal cortex, or on performance of a cognitive task that tests working memory capacity. These data indicate that BPA exerts an age-dependent detrimental impact on primate brain development, at blood levels within the range measured in humans having only environmental contact with BPA.",PMC3660149

It is not known, however, whether such early gestational and/or lactational exposure can influence the later adult-type Leydig cell phenotype. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to dibutyl phthalate (DBP; from gestational day (GD) 14.5 to postnatal day (PND) 6) or diethylstilbestrol (DES; from GD14.5 to GD16.5) during a short gestational/lactational window, and male offspring subsequently analysed for various postnatal testicular parameters. All offspring remained in good health throughout the study. Maternal xenobiotic treatment appeared to modify specific Leydig cell gene expression in male offspring, particularly during the dynamic phase of mid-puberty, with serum INSL3 concentrations showing that these compounds led to a faster attainment of peak values, and a modest acceleration of the pubertal trajectory. Part of this effect appeared to be due to a treatment-specific impact on Leydig cell proliferation during puberty for both xenobiotics. Taken together, these results support the notion that maternal exposure to certain xenobiotics can also influence the development of the adult-type Leydig cell population, possibly through an effect on the Leydig stem cell population.",PMC3739150

We analyzed spot urines for total BPA collected during pregnancy and child ages 3, 5, and 7 years from African Americans and Dominicans (n=568) enrolled in the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health birth cohort and residing in Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx. Adjusting for specific gravity, generalized estimating equations were used to compare BPA concentrations across paired samples and linear regression analyses were used to determine relationships between BPA, season of sample collection, socio-demographic variables and urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites. BPA was detected in ≥ 94% of samples. Prenatal concentrations were significantly lower than postnatal concentrations. Geometric means were higher among African Americans compared to Dominicans in prenatal (p=0.008), 5 year (p<0.001) and 7 year (p=0.017) samples. Geometric means at 5 and 7 years were higher (p=0.021, p=0.041 respectively) for children of mothers never married compared to mothers ever married at enrollment. BPA concentrations were correlated with phthalate metabolite concentrations at prenatal, 3, 5 and 7 years (p-values <0.05).

Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used weak estrogenic environmental ED and it is debated whether BPA concentrations within the average internal exposure are toxic. In the present study we investigated the effects of 10(-12) to 10(-5) M BPA concentrations on fetal Leydig cell function, as fetal life is a critical period of sensitivity to ED effects on male reproductive function. To this aim, fetal testes from human at 6.5-10.5 gestational weeks (GW) or from rat and mouse at a comparable critical period of development (14.5 days post-coitum (dpc) for rat and 12.5 dpc for mouse) were explanted and cultured using our validated organotypic culture system in the presence or absence of BPA for 1-3 days. BPA concentrations as low as 10(-8) M reduced testosterone secretion by human testes from day 1 of culture onwards, but not by mouse and rat testes where concentrations equal to 10(-5) M BPA were required. Similarly, 10(-8) M BPA reduced INSL3 mRNA levels only in human cultured testes. On the contrary, 10(-5) and 10(-6) M diethylstilbestrol (DES), a classical estrogenic compound, affected testosterone secretion only in rat and mouse testis cultures, but not in human testis cultures. Lastly, contrarily to the DES effect, the negative effect of BPA on testosterone produced by the mouse fetal testis was maintained after invalidation of estrogen receptor α (ERα). In conclusion, these results evidenced i) a deleterious effect of BPA on fetal Leydig cells function in human for concentrations from 10(-8) M upwards, ii) species-specific differences raising concerns about extrapolation of data from rodent studies to human risk assessment, iii) a specific signaling pathway for BPA which differs from the DES one and which does not involve ERα.",PMC3524173

Enzyme preparations containing mainly laccases, obtained from Ganoderma stipitatum and Lentinus swartzii, two autochthonous Colombian forest white rot fungi (WRF), previously identified as high enzyme producers, were used to remove BPA and TCS from aqueous solutions. A Box-Behnken factorial design showed that pH, temperature, and duration of treatment were significant model terms for the elimination of BPA and TCS. Our results demonstrated that these EDCs were extensively removed from 5 mg L(-1) solutions after a contact time of 6 hours. Ninety-four percent of TCS and 97.8% of BPA were removed with the enzyme solution from G. stipitatum; 83.2% of TCS and 88.2% of BPA were removed with the L. swartzii enzyme solution. After a 6-hour treatment with enzymes from G. stipitatum and L. swartzii, up to 90% of the estrogenic activity of BPA was lost, as shown by the yeast estrogen screen assay. 2,2-Azino-bis-(3-ethylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) was used as a mediator (laccase/mediator system) and significantly improved the laccase catalyzed elimination of BPA and TCS. The elimination of BPA in the absence of a mediator resulted in production of oligomers of molecular weights of 454, 680, and 906 amu as determined by mass spectra analysis. The elimination of TCS in the same conditions produced dimers, trimers, and tetramers of molecular weights of 574, 859, and 1146 amu. Ecotoxicological studies using Daphnia pulex to determine lethal concentration (LC50) showed an important reduction of the toxicity of BPA and TCS solutions after enzymatic treatments. Use of laccases emerges thus as a key alternative in the development of innovative wastewater treatment technologies.

Parental CD1 mice were acclimated to defined diet containing BPA (0.03, 0.3, 3, 30, or 300 ppm) or 17α-ethinyl estradiol (EE; 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.01 ppm) and bred to produce progeny (F1) that were maintained through adulthood on the same diet as the parents. In F1 females, uterine weights were increased in all EE and the 30-ppm BPA-exposure groups, demonstrating model sensitivity and estrogen-like actions of BPA. In BPA-exposed females, no treatment-related differences were observed in parental reproductive function, or in the timing of puberty and metabolic function in female offspring. In F1 males, modest changes in body weight, adiposity and glucose tolerance, consistent with improved metabolic function, were observed. Associated with increased prolactin and increased circulating testosterone levels, balanopreputial separation was accelerated by 0.03 and 3.0 ppm BPA and anogenital distance at postnatal day 21 was increased in males by 0.03 ppm BPA. Sperm counts were also increased with 3.0 ppm BPA exposures.

However, little is known about the effects of MEHP on ovarian antral follicles. Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that MEHP inhibits follicle growth via oxidative stress pathways. The data indicate that MEHP increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and inhibits follicle growth in antral follicles, whereas N-acetylcysteine (NAC; an antioxidant) restores ROS levels to control levels and rescues follicles from MEHP-induced inhibition of follicle growth. To further analyze the mechanism by which MEHP induces oxidative stress and inhibits follicle growth, the expression and activities of various key antioxidant enzymes (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase [SOD1], glutathione peroxidase [GPX], and catalase [CAT]) and the expression of key cell-cycle regulators (Ccnd2, Ccne1, and Cdk4) and apoptotic regulators (Bcl-2 and Bax) were compared in control and MEHP-treated follicles. The data indicate that MEHP inhibits the expression and activities of SOD1 and GPX; does not inhibit Cat expression; inhibits the expression of Ccnd2, Ccne1, Cdk4, and Bcl-2; but increases the expression of Bax compared to controls. Furthermore, NAC blocks these toxic effects of MEHP. Collectively, these data suggest that MEHP induces oxidative stress by disrupting the activities of antioxidant enzymes. This may lead to decreased expression of cell-cycle regulators and antiapoptotic regulators and increased expression of proapoptotic factors, which then may lead to inhibition of follicle growth.",PMC4435432

This study examined the effect of fenhexamid and fludioxonil on the expression of the oncomiR miR-21 in MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and downstream targets of miR-21 in MCF-7 cells. Fenhexamid and fludioxonil stimulated miR-21 expression in a concentration-dependent manner and reduced the expression of miR-21 target Pdcd4 protein. Antisense to miR-21 blocked the increase in Pdcd4 protein by fenhexamid and fludioxonil. Fenhexamid and fludioxonil reduced miR-125b and miR-181a, demonstrating specificity of miRNA regulation. Induction of miR-21 was inhibited by the estrogen receptor antagonist fulvestrant, by androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide, by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, and by inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways. Fenhexamid activation was inhibited by the arylhydrocarbon receptor antagonist α-napthoflavone. Fenhexamid and fludioxonil did not affect dihydrotestosterone-induced miR-21 expression. Fludioxonil, but not fenhexamid, inhibited MCF-7 cell viability, and both inhibited estradiol-induced cell proliferation and reduced cell motility.

Here, dams during gestation and lactation were fed with a phytoestrogen-free control diet, the same diet supplemented with either ethinyl estradiol (0.1 ppb), or one of the three doses of BPA (50 mg, 5 mg, 50 μg/kg feed weight). After weaning, the pups were maintained on control diet until they reached sexual maturity and then assessed for both spatial learning capabilities and anxiety-like and exploratory behaviors. Relative to controls, males exposed to the two upper but not the lowest dose of BPA demonstrated similar impairments in spatial learning, increased anxiety and reduced exploratory behaviors as ethinyl estradiol-exposed males, while females exposed to ethinyl estradiol, but not to BPA, consistently exhibited masculinized spatial abilities. We also determined whether dams maintained chronically on the upper dose of BPA contained environmentally relevant concentrations of BPA in their blood. While serum concentrations of unconjugated BPA in controls were below the minimum level of detection, those from dams on the BPA diet were comparable (5.48±2.07 ng/ml) to concentrations that have been observed in humans.

The widespread exposure of individuals to BPA is suspected to affect a variety of physiological functions, including reproduction, development, and metabolism. Here we report that the mechanisms by which BPA and two congeners, bisphenol AF and bisphenol C (BPC), bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ER) α and β differ from that used by 17β-estradiol. We show that bisphenols act as partial agonists of ERs by activating the N-terminal activation function 1 regardless of their effect on the C-terminal activation function 2, which ranges from weak agonism (with BPA) to antagonism (with BPC). Crystallographic analysis of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs reveals two discrete binding modes, reflecting the different activities of compounds on ERs. BPA and 17β-estradiol bind to ERs in a similar fashion, whereas, with a phenol ring pointing toward the activation helix H12, the orientation of BPC accounts for the marked antagonist character of this compound. Based on structural data, we developed a protocol for in silico evaluation of the interaction between bisphenols and ERs or other members of the nuclear hormone receptor family, such as estrogen-related receptor γ and androgen receptor, which are two known main targets of bisphenols. Overall, this study provides a wealth of tools and information that could be used for the development of BPA substitutes devoid of nuclear hormone receptor-mediated activity and more generally for environmental risk assessment.",PMC3443136

Herein, we describe the development and optimization of a protein-based inhibition assay for the quantification of OH-PCBs. Specifically, the photoprotein aequorin was utilized for the detection of OH-PCBs. We hypothesized that OH-PCBs interact with aequorin, and we established that OH-PCBs actually inhibit the bioluminescence of aequorin in a dose-dependent manner. We took advantage of this phenomenon to develop an assay that is capable of detecting a wide variety of OH-PCBs with a range of detection limits, the best detection limit being 11 nM for the compound 2-hydroxy-2',3,4',5',6-pentachorobiphenyl. The viability of this system for the screening of OH-PCBs in spiked biological and environmental samples was also established. We envision the implementation of this novel bioluminescence inhibition assay as a rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective method for monitoring OH-PCBs. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time aequorin has been employed to detect an analyte by the inhibition of its bioluminescence reaction.

PCBs were grouped according to hypothesized biological action (1b (sum of weak phenobarbital inducers), 2b (sum of limited dioxin activity), and 3 (sum of CYP1A and CYP2b inducers)) or degree of ortho- substitution (mono, di, tri). Secondary analyses examined associations between total PCB exposure and exposure to individual congeners. Each unit increase in mono-ortho substituted PCBs was associated with a 0.30 week decrease (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59, -0.016), corresponding to a 2.1 (95% CI -4.13, -0.11) day decrease in length of gestation. Similar associations were estimated for di-ortho substituted PCBs, (1.4 day decrease; (95% CI -2.9, 0.1)) and group 3 PCBs (0.84 day decrease; (95% CI -1.8, 0.11). We found similar associations in congener specific analyses and for the sum of congeners. Our study provides new evidence that PCB exposure shortens length of gestation in humans.

We hypothesized that the consistent lifestyle of an Old Order Mennonite (OOM) community would provide an ideal setting in which to characterize sources of exposure to BPA and phthalates. We obtained urine samples from ten mid-term pregnant OOM women (ages-21-39) to determine concentrations of 9 phthalate metabolites and BPA and collected a self-reported survey of participants' household environment, product use, and lifestyle within a 48-h period prior to urine collection. We compared their metabolite concentrations to pregnant women included in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2007-2008). Although OOM participants reported some use of plastic and fragranced household products, concentrations of metabolites were lower and significantly less for BPA (p=0.002) and phthalate metabolites MEHP (p=0.0215), MiBP (p=0.0020) and MEP (p=0.021), when compared to NHANES pregnant women. Levels of other phthalate metabolites were also lower in this population. Our data suggest three practices that may contribute to these lower levels: (1) consuming mostly homegrown produce (ingestion), (2) no cosmetics and limited use of personal care products, and (3) transportation primarily by sources other than automobiles.",PMC3641683

It is present in a variety of products used daily including food containers, paper, and dental sealants and is now widely detected in human urine and blood. Exposure to BPA during development may affect brain organization and behavior, perhaps as a consequence of its actions as a steroid hormone agonist/antagonist and/or an epigenetic modifier. Here we show that BPA produces transgenerational alterations in genes and behavior. Female mice received phytoestrogen-free chow with or without BPA before mating and throughout gestation. Plasma levels of BPA in supplemented dams were in a range similar to those measured in humans. Juveniles in the first generation exposed to BPA in utero displayed fewer social interactions as compared with control mice, whereas in later generations (F(2) and F(4)), the effect of BPA was to increase these social interactions. Brains from embryos (embryonic d 18.5) exposed to BPA had lower gene transcript levels for several estrogen receptors, oxytocin, and vasopressin as compared with controls; decreased vasopressin mRNA persisted into the F(4) generation, at which time oxytocin was also reduced but only in males. Thus, exposure to a low dose of BPA, only during gestation, has immediate and long-lasting, transgenerational effects on mRNA in brain and social behaviors. Heritable effects of an endocrine-disrupting chemical have implications for complex neurological diseases and highlight the importance of considering gene-environment interactions in the etiology of complex disease.",PMC3404345

Health threats that were historically responsible for immeasurable tolls on human life are now all but eradicated within certain populations, specifically those that enjoy higher degrees of socio-economic status and access to healthcare. However, modernization and its resulting lifestyle trends have ushered in a new era of chronic illness; one in which an unprecedented number of people are estimated to contract cancer and other inflammatory diseases. Here, we explore the idea that homeostasis has been redefined within just a few generations, and that diseases such as colorectal cancer are the result of fluctuating physiological and molecular imbalances. Phytochemical-deprived, pro-inflammatory diets combined with low-dose exposures to environmental toxins, including bisphenol-A (BPA) and other endocrine disruptors, are now linked to increasing incidences of cancer in westernized societies and developing countries. There is recent evidence that disease determinants are likely set in utero and further perpetuated into adulthood dependent upon the innate and environmentally acquired phenotype unique to each individual. In order to address a disease as multi-factorial, case-specific, and remarkably adaptive as cancer, research must focus on its root causes in order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which they can be prevented or counteracted via plant-derived compounds such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and resveratrol. The significant role of epigenetics in the regulation of these complex processes is emphasized here to form a comprehensive view of the dynamic interactions that influence modern-day carcinogenesis, and how sensibly restoring homeostatic balance may be the key to the cancer riddle.",PMC3365481

However, the detailed mechanism(s) by which DDT affects cellular physiology remains incompletely defined. We and others have shown that DDT activates cell-signaling cascades, culminating in the activation of estrogen receptor-dependent and -independent gene expression. Here, we identify a mechanism by which DDT alters cellular signaling and gene expression, independent of the estrogen receptor. We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction array analysis of gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells using either estradiol (E₂) or o,p´-DDT to identify distinct cellular gene expression responses. To elucidate the mechanisms by which DDT regulates cell signaling, we used molecular and pharmacological techniques. E₂ and DDT treatment both altered the expression of many of the genes assayed, but up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was observed only after DDT treatment, and this increase was not affected by the pure estrogen receptor α antagonist ICI 182780. Furthermore, DDT increased activation of the HIF-1 response element (HRE), a known enhancer of the VEGFA gene. This DDT-mediated increase in HRE activity was augmented by the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein) and was dependent on the p38 pathway. DDT up-regulated the expression of several genes in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that were not altered by treatment with E₂, including VEGFA. We propose that this DDT-initiated, ER-independent stimulation of gene expression is due to DDT's ability to initiate crosstalk between MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways and transcriptional coactivators.",PMC3440107

We previously demonstrated that the xenoestrogen, bisphenol A (BPA), was able to induce the transformation in vitro of human breast epithelial cells. The normal-like human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F, formed tubules in collagen (3-D cultures), although after treatment with BPA (10-5 M and 10-6 M BPA) the cells produced less tubules (73% and 80%, respectively) and some spherical masses (27% and 20%, respectively). In the present study, expression and DNA methylation analyses were performed in these cells after exposure to BPA. These cells showed an increased expression of BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1, CtIP, RAD51 and BRCC3, all of which are genes involved in DNA repair, as well as the downregulation of PDCD5 and BCL2L11 (BIM), both of which are involved in apoptosis. Furthermore, DNA methylation analysis showed that the BPA exposure induced the hypermethylation of BCL2L11, PARD6G, FOXP1 and SFRS11, as well as the hypomethylation of NUP98 and CtIP (RBBP8). Our results indicate that normal human breast epithelial cells exposed to BPA have increased expressions of genes involved in DNA repair in order to overcome the DNA damage induced by this chemical.

We reviewed and identified experimental animal literature from which we developed a low-dose, linear model of PCB body burdens and decrements in free thyroxine (FT(4)) and total thyroxine (TT(4)), accounting for 33 PCB congeners; extrapolated the dose-response from animals to humans; and compared the animal dose-response to the dose-response of PCB body burdens and TH changes from eleven human epidemiological studies. We estimated a range of potencies for PCB congeners (over 4 orders of magnitude), with the strongest for PCB 126. Our approach to developing toxic equivalency models produced relative potencies similar to the toxicity equivalency factors (TEFs) from the World Health Organization (WHO). We generally found that the dose-response extrapolated from the animal studies tends to under-predict the dose-response estimated from human epidemiological studies.

This study assessed the effects of BPA on fetal mammary gland development in nonhuman primates. Pregnant rhesus monkeys were fed 400 μg of BPA per kg of body weight daily from gestational day 100 to term, which resulted in 0.68 ± 0.312 ng of unconjugated BPA per mL of maternal serum, a level comparable to that found in humans. At birth, the mammary glands of female offspring were removed for morphological analysis. Morphological parameters similar to those shown to be affected in rodents exposed prenatally to BPA were measured in whole-mounted glands; estrogen receptor (ER) α and β expression were assessed in paraffin sections. Student's t tests for equality of means were used to assess differences between exposed and unexposed groups. The density of mammary buds was significantly increased in BPA-exposed monkeys, and the overall development of their mammary gland was more advanced compared with unexposed monkeys. No significant differences were observed in ER expression. Altogether, gestational exposure to the estrogen-mimic BPA altered the developing mammary glands of female nonhuman primates in a comparable manner to that observed in rodents.",PMC3361442

We previously demonstrated that ER induction of the chemokine CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor-1) is required for estradiol (E2)-stimulated proliferation of human ovarian carcinoma cells. In the current study, we report that known ""endocrine disrupting chemicals"" (EDCs) display mitogenic activities in ovarian cancer cells via their ability to activate the ER and upregulate CXCL12 expression. Notably, the EDCs genistein, bisphenol A and HPTE stimulated both cell proliferation and induction of CXCL12 mRNA and protein in a manner comparable to estradiol. The effects were completely attenuated by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780, revealing that observed activities of these agents were receptor-mediated. In cell proliferation assays, the mitogenic effects of estradiol and EDCs were obviated by siRNAs targeting CXCL12 and restored upon addition of exogenous CXCL12. Furthermore, an inhibitor to the CXCL12 receptor CXCR4 completely attenuated growth-stimulatory effects of E2 and EDCs. These studies highlight a potential role of EDCs possessing estrogenic activities in the etiology of ovarian cancer. Moreover, they suggest that the ER-CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis may represent a promising target for development of therapeutics for ER+ ovarian cancers.",PMC4287997

Extensive research has been so far unable to explain the aetiology of this condition, whereas a growing body of evidence suggests the involvement of environmental factors. Phthalates, given their extensive use and their persistence, are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. They are EDs (endocrine disruptors) suspected to interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore they represent interesting candidate risk factors for ASD pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of the primary and secondary metabolites of DEHP [di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate] in children with ASD. A total of 48 children with ASD (male: 36, female: 12; mean age: 11 ± 5 years) and age- and sex-comparable 45 HCs (healthy controls; male: 25, female: 20; mean age: 12 ± 5 years) were enrolled.

Between-participant variations in sampling conditions of these biological samples constitute a potential source of exposure misclassification. Few studies attempted to correct biomarker levels for this error. We aimed to assess the influence of sampling conditions on concentrations of urinary biomarkers of select phenols and phthalates, two widely-produced families of chemicals, and to standardize biomarker concentrations on sampling conditions. Urine samples were collected between 2002 and 2006 among 287 pregnant women from Eden and Pélagie cohorts, from which phthalates and phenols metabolites levels were assayed. We applied a 2-step standardization method based on regression residuals. First, the influence of sampling conditions (including sampling hour, duration of storage before freezing) and of creatinine levels on biomarker concentrations were characterized using adjusted linear regression models. In the second step, the model estimates were used to remove the variability in biomarker concentrations due to sampling conditions and to standardize concentrations as if all samples had been collected under the same conditions (e.g., same hour of urine collection). Sampling hour was associated with concentrations of several exposure biomarkers. After standardization for sampling conditions, median concentrations differed by--38% for 2,5-dichlorophenol to +80 % for a metabolite of diisodecyl phthalate. However, at the individual level, standardized biomarker levels were strongly correlated (correlation coefficients above 0.80) with unstandardized measures. Sampling conditions, such as sampling hour, should be systematically collected in biomarker-based studies, in particular when the biomarker half-life is short. The 2-step standardization method based on regression residuals that we proposed in order to limit the impact of heterogeneity in sampling conditions could be further tested in studies describing levels of biomarkers or their influence on health.",PMC3533777

Male rats exposed in utero to certain phthalate plasticizers exhibit multinucleated germ cell (MNG) induction and suppressed steroidogenic gene expression and testosterone production in the fetal testis, causing TDS-consistent effects of hypospadias and cryptorchidism. Mice exposed to phthalates in utero exhibit MNG induction only. This disparity in response demonstrates a species-specific sensitivity to phthalate-induced suppression of fetal Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Importantly, ex vivo phthalate exposure of the fetal testis does not recapitulate the species-specific endocrine disruption, demonstrating the need for a new bioassay to assess the human response to phthalates. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a rat and mouse testis xenograft bioassay of phthalate exposure and examine the human fetal testis response. Fetal rat, mouse, and human testes were xenografted into immunodeficient rodent hosts, and hosts were gavaged with a range of phthalate doses over multiple days. Xenografts were harvested and assessed for histopathology and steroidogenic end points. Consistent with the in utero response, phthalate exposure induced MNG formation in rat and mouse xenografts, but only rats exhibited suppressed steroidogenesis. Across a range of doses, human fetal testis xenografts exhibited MNG induction but were resistant to suppression of steroidogenic gene expression.

We used coexpression analysis of publicly available data to investigate the combinatorial actions of nuclear receptors and genes involved in histone methylation in normal testis and when faced with endocrine disruptor compounds. The expression patterns of a set of genes were profiled across testis tissue in human, rat and mouse, plus control and exposed samples from four toxicity experiments in the rat. Our results indicate that histone methylation events are a more general component of nuclear receptor mediated transcriptional regulation in the testis than previously appreciated. Coexpression patterns support the role of a gatekeeper mechanism involving the histone methylation modifiers Kdm1, Prdm2, and Ehmt1 and indicate that this mechanism is a common determinant of transcriptional integrity for genes critical to diverse physiological endpoints relevant to endocrine disruption. Coexpression patterns following exposure to vinclozolin and dibutyl phthalate suggest that coactivity of the demethylase Kdm1 in particular warrants further investigation in relation to endocrine disruptor mode of action.

At lower concentrations, BPA acted as an antagonist for ERα in Ishikawa cells and BPAF acted as an antagonist for ERβ in HeLa cells, whereas Zea was only a partial antagonist for ERα. ERE-mediated activation by BPA and BPAF was via the AF-2 function of ERα, but Zea activated via both the AF-1 and AF-2 functions. Endogenous ERα target genes and rapid signaling via the p44/42 MAPK pathway were activated by BPA, BPAF, and Zea. BPA and BPAF can function as EDCs by acting as cell type-specific agonists (≥ 10 nM) or antagonists (≤ 10 nM) for ERα and ERβ.

In the present study, we examined the effects of early prepubertal BPA exposure on the onset of puberty and reproductive parameters such as estrous cycle and reproductive organ weights in female mice. Female mice were injected subcutaneously at postnatal day (PND) 8 with BPA (0.1, 1, 10, 100 mg/kg) in sesame oil or with sesame oil alone. Body weight was measured from PND 10 to 70. Vaginal opening and estrous cycle were monitored from PND 20 to 29. Animals were sacrificed at PND 25, 30, and 70, and the ovary and uterus weights were measured. Early prepubertal exposure to BPA (10 and 100 mg/kg) significantly decreased body weight from PND 18 to 30. BPA treated mice at testing dose levels showed early opening of the vagina compared to the control group. The number of estrous cycle and days of estrus were significantly decreased in high dose (100 mg/kg) BPA treated mice. The ovary weight at PND 25 and 30 was significantly decreased in all BPA treatment groups. Early prepubertal exposure to BPA accelerated the onset of puberty but decreased reproductive parameters in female mice.",PMC3283057

It alters pancreatic β-cell function and can be considered a risk factor for type 2 diabetes in rodents. Here we used ERβ-/- mice to study whether ERβ is involved in the rapid regulation of K(ATP) channel activity, calcium signals and insulin release elicited by environmentally relevant doses of BPA (1 nM). We also investigated these effects of BPA in β-cells and whole islets of Langerhans from humans. 1 nM BPA rapidly decreased K(ATP) channel activity, increased glucose-induced [Ca(2+)](i) signals and insulin release in β-cells from WT mice but not in cells from ERβ-/- mice. The rapid reduction in the K(ATP) channel activity and the insulinotropic effect was seen in human cells and islets. BPA actions were stronger in human islets compared to mouse islets when the same BPA concentration was used. Our findings suggest that BPA behaves as a strong estrogen via nuclear ERβ and indicate that results obtained with BPA in mouse β-cells may be extrapolated to humans. This supports that BPA should be considered as a risk factor for metabolic disorders in humans.",PMC3275611

PCBs and PBDEs are structurally similar chemicals and affect thyroid hormone function and behavior in children and laboratory rodents. Although coexposure frequently exists, the in vivo developmental effects of combined exposure to PCBs and PBDEs on thyroxine (T4) levels are unknown. We examined the effects of PCB and PBDE coexposure from gestational day 6 through postnatal day (p) 21, alone and in combination, on T4 levels in rat offspring. In males, exposure to PCBs and PBDEs at 1.7, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 μmol/kg/day induced equivalent and dose-dependent reductions in T4 from p 7 to p 21. Exposure to equimolar mixtures of PCBs and PBDEs at 3.4, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μmol/kg/day additively reduced T4 from p 7 to p 21 in males. In a second series of experiments, we determined sex effects on the mixture exposures and found that coexposure to PCBs and PBDEs had similar additive effects on T4 levels in male and female offspring. This study demonstrates that equimolar exposure to PCBs and PBDEs induces similar reductions in T4 levels and that coexposure to a mixture of PCBs and PBDEs has additive effects on T4 levels. These thyroid hormone effects of coexposure to PCBs and PBDEs are important when considering the cumulative effects of coexposure to multiple environmental thyroid hormone-disrupting agents in risk assessment for developmental disorders.",PMC3327870

These effects may lead to the disruption of major regulatory mechanisms, the onset of developmental disorders, and carcinogenesis. Especially, among diverse EDCs, xenoestrogens such as bisphenol A, dioxins, and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate, have been shown to activate estrogen receptors (ERs) and to modulate cellular functions induced by ERs. Furthermore, they appear to be closely related with carcinogenicity in estrogen-dependant cancers, including breast, ovary, and prostate cancers. In in vivo animal models, prenatal exposure to xenoestrogens changed the development of the mouse reproductive organs and increased the susceptibility to further carcinogenic exposure and tumor occurence in adults. Unlike EDCs, which are chemically synthesized, several phytoestrogens such as genistein and resveratrol showed chemopreventive effects on specific cancers by contending with ER binding and regulating normal ER action in target tissues of mice. These results support the notion that a diet containing high levels of phytoestrogens can have protective effects on estrogen-related diseases. In spite of the diverse evidences of EDCs and phytoestrogens on causation and prevention of estrogen-dependant cancers provided in this article, there are still disputable questions about the dose-response effect of EDCs or chemopreventive potentials of phytoestrogens. As a wide range of EDCs including phytoestrogens have been remarkably increasing in the environment with the rapid growth in our industrial society and more closely affecting human and wildlife, the potential risks of EDCs in endocrine disruption and carcinogenesis are important issues and needed to be verified in detail.",PMC3251756

BPA and its analogues are present in environmental and human samples. Many endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including BPA, have been shown to activate the pregnane X receptor (PXR), a nuclear receptor that functions as a master regulator of xenobiotic metabolism. However, the detailed mechanism by which these chemicals activate PXR remains unknown. We investigated the mechanism by which BPA interacts with and activates PXR and examined selected BPA analogues to determine whether they bind to and activate PXR. Cell-based reporter assays, in silico ligand-PXR docking studies, and site-directed mutagenesis were combined to study the interaction between BPA and PXR. We also investigated the influence of BPA and its analogues on the regulation of PXR target genes in human LS180 cells. We found that BPA and several of its analogues are potent agonists for human PXR (hPXR) but do not affect mouse PXR activity. We identified key residues within hPXR's ligand-binding pocket that constitute points of interaction with BPA. We also deduced the structural requirements of BPA analogues that activate hPXR. BPA and its analogues can also induce PXR target gene expression in human LS180 cells. The present study advances our understanding of the mechanism by which BPA interacts with and activates human PXR.

They are easily released from plastics into the environment and can be found in measurable levels in human fluids. Phthalates are agonists for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), through which they regulate translocator protein (TSPO; 18 kDa) transcription in a tissue-specific manner. TSPO is a drug- and cholesterol-binding protein involved in mitochondrial respiration, steroid formation, and cell proliferation. TSPO has been shown to increase during differentiation and decrease during maturation in mouse adipocytes. The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) on the differentiation of human SW 872 preadipocyte cells, and examine the role of TSPO in the process. After 4 days of treatment with 10 µM MEHP, we observed changes in the transcription of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha, adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase, glucose transporters 1 and 4, and the S100 calcium binding protein B, all of which are markers of preadipocyte differentiation. These observed gene expression changes coincided with a decrease in cellular proliferation without affecting cellular triglyceride content. Taken together, these data suggest that MEHP exerts a differentiating effect on human preadipocytes. Interestingly, MEHP was able to temporarily increase TSPO mRNA levels through the PPAR-α and β/δ pathways. These results suggest that TSPO can be considered an important player in the differentiation process itself, or alternatively a factor whose presence is essential for adipocyte development.",PMC3244402

In the present study, the roles of estrogen receptors (ER) in mediating the rapid contractile and arrhythmogenic effects of estrogens were examined. Contractility was used as an index to assess the impact of E(2) or BPA on Ca(2+) handling in rodent ventricular myocytes. The concentration-response curve for the stimulatory effects of BPA and E(2) on female myocyte was inverted-U shaped. Detectable effects for each compound were observed at 10(-12) M, and the most efficacious concentrations for each were at 10(-9) M. Sensitivity to E(2) and BPA was not observed in male myocytes and was abolished in myocytes from ovariectomized females. Analysis using protein-conjugated E(2) suggests that these rapid actions are induced by membrane-associated receptors. Analysis using selective ER agonists and antagonists and a genetic ERβ knockout mouse model showed that ERα and ERβ have opposing actions in myocytes and that the balance between ERβ and ERα signaling is the prime regulator of the sex-specific sensitivity toward estrogens. The response of female myocytes to E(2) and BPA is dominated by the stimulatory ERβ-mediated signaling, and the absence of BPA and E(2) responsiveness in males is due to a counterbalancing-suppressive action of ERα. We conclude that the sex-specific sensitivity of myocytes to estrogens and the rapid arrhythmogenic effects of BPA and estradiol in the female heart are regulated by the balance between ERα and ERβ signaling.",PMC3275382

We measured the BPA levels of maternal blood (n = 97) and umbilical cord blood (n = 97) with a high-performance liquid chromatography/UV detector. The protein secretion of leptin and adiponectin were separately determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Newborn abalone eggs and sperm were exposed separately to different DMP concentrations (1, 10 or 100 ppb) for 60 min. At the end-point of exposure, the DMP-treated eggs and sperm were collected for analysis of their ultra-structures, ATPase activities and total lipid levels, and the fertilized gametes (embryos) were collected to monitor related reproductive parameters (fertilization rate, abnormal development rate and hatching success rate). Treatment with DMP did not significantly alter the structure or total lipid content of eggs at any of the doses tested. Hatching failures and morphological abnormalities were only observed with the highest dose of DMP (100 ppb). However, DMP exposure did suppress sperm ATPase activities and affect the morphological character of their mitochondria. DMP-treated sperm exhibited dose-dependent decreases in fertilization efficiency, morphogenesis and hatchability. Relatively obvious toxicological effects were observed when both sperm and eggs were exposed to DMP. Furthermore, RT-PCR results indicate that treatment of gametes with DMP changed the expression patterns of physiologically-regulated genes (cyp3a, 17β-HSD-11 and 17β-HSD-12) in subsequent embryogenesis.

The primary objective of this study was to determine whether multiple PFAAs enhance hepatic tumorigenesis in trout, an animal model that represents human insensitivity to peroxisome proliferation. A two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model was employed in trout to evaluate PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (8:2FtOH) as complete carcinogens or promoters of aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))- and/or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced liver cancer. A custom trout DNA microarray was used to assess hepatic transcriptional response to these dietary treatments in comparison with E2 and the classic peroxisome proliferator, clofibrate (CLOF). Incidence, multiplicity, and size of liver tumors in trout fed diets containing E2, PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA were significantly higher compared with AFB(1)-initiated animals fed control diet, whereas PFOS caused a minor increase in liver tumor incidence. E2 and PFOA also enhanced MNNG-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis. Pearson correlation analyses, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, and principal components analyses showed that the hepatic gene expression profiles for E2 and PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, and PFOS were overall highly similar, though distinct patterns of gene expression were evident for each treatment, particularly for PFNA.

The rapid (<7 min) effects of BPA and 17β-estradiol (E2) in the heart and ventricular myocytes from rodents were investigated in the present study. In isolated ventricular myocytes from young adult females, but not males, physiological concentrations of BPA or E2 (10⁻⁹ M) rapidly induced arrhythmogenic triggered activities. The effects of BPA were particularly pronounced when combined with estradiol. Under conditions of catecholamine stimulation, E2 and BPA promoted ventricular arrhythmias in female, but not male, hearts. The cellular mechanism of the female-specific pro-arrhythmic effects of BPA and E2 were investigated. Exposure to E2 and/or BPA rapidly altered myocyte Ca²⁺ handling; in particular, estrogens markedly increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca²⁺ leak, and increased SR Ca²⁺ load. Ryanodine (10⁻⁷ M) inhibition of SR Ca²⁺ leak suppressed estrogen-induced triggered activities. The rapid response of female myocytes to estrogens was abolished in an estrogen receptor (ER) β knockout mouse model. Physiologically-relevant concentrations of BPA and E2 promote arrhythmias in a female-specific manner in rat hearts; the pro-arrhythmic actions of estrogens are mediated by ERβ-signaling through alterations of myocyte Ca²⁺ handling, particularly increases in SR Ca²⁺ leak.

In the present study, we analyzed the expression of miRNAs and their target genes in mouse Sertoli TM4 cells to better understand the regulatory roles of miRNAs on Sertoli cells after NP exposure. Mouse TM4 Sertoli cells were treated with NP for 3 or 24 h, and global gene and miRNA expression were analyzed using Agilent mouse whole genome and mouse miRNA v13 arrays. We identified genes that were > 2-fold differentially expressed in NP-treated cells and control cells (P < 0.05) and analyzed their functions through Gene Ontology analysis. We also identified miRNAs that were differentially expressed in NP-treated and control cells. Of the 186 miRNAs the expression of which differed between NP-treated and control cells, 59 and 147 miRNAs exhibited 1.3-fold increased or decreased expression at 3 and 24 h, respectively. Network analysis of deregulated miRNAs suggested that Ppara may regulate the expression of certain miRNAs, including miR-378, miR-125a-3p miR-20a, miR-203, and miR-101a, after exposure to NP. Additionally, comprehensive analysis of predicted target genes for miRNAs showed that the expression of genes with roles in cell proliferation, the cell cycle, and cell death were regulated by miRNA in NP-treated TM4 cells. Levels of expression of the miRNAs miR-135a* and miR-199a-5p were validated by qRT-PCR. Finally, miR-135a* target gene analysis suggests that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following exposure to NP exposure may be mediated by miR-135a* through regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.

In utero, perinatal or neonatal exposure of BPA to rats affect the male reproductive function, such as the blood-testis barrier (BTB) integrity. This effect of BPA on BTB integrity in immature rats is likely mediated via a loss of gap junction function at the BTB, failing to coordinate tight junction and anchoring junction function at the site to maintain the immunological barrier integrity. This in turn activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) downstream and an increase in protein endocytosis, destabilizing the BTB. The cadmium-induced disruption of testicular dysfunction is mediated initially via its effects on the occludin/ZO-1/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) complex at the BTB, causing redistribution of proteins at the Sertoli-Sertoli cell interface, leading to the BTB disruption. The damaging effects of these toxicants to testicular function are mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) downstream, which in turn perturbs the actin bundling and accelerates the actin-branching activity, causing disruption of the Sertoli cell tight junction (TJ)-barrier function at the BTB and perturbing spermatid adhesion at the apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES, a testis-specific anchoring junction type) that leads to premature release of germ cells from the testis. However, the use of specific inhibitors against MAPK was shown to block or delay the cadmium-induced testicular injury, such as BTB disruption and germ cell loss. These findings suggest that there may be a common downstream p38 and/or Erk1/2 MAPK-based signaling pathway involving polarity proteins and actin regulators that is shared between different toxicants that induce male reproductive dysfunction. As such, the use of inhibitors and/or antagonists against specific MAPKs can possibly be used to ""manage"" the illnesses caused by these toxicants and/or ""protect"" industrial workers being exposed to high levels of these toxicants in their work environment.",PMC3158642

In this study, treatment with 17β-estradiol (E(2)) or BPA increased mRNA levels of E(2)-responsive genes related to apoptosis, cancer and cell cycle, signal transduction and nucleic acid binding etc. In parallel with their microarray data, the mRNA levels of some altered genes including RAB31_MEMBER RAS ONCOGENE FAMILY (U59877), CYCLIN D1 (X59798), CYCLIN-DEPENDENT KINASE 4 (U37022), IGF-BINDING PROTEIN 4 (U20982), and ANTI-MULLERIAN HORMONE (NM_000479) were significantly induced by E(2) or BPA in this cell model. These results indicate that BPA in parallel with E(2) induced the transcriptional levels of E(2)-responsive genes in an estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BG-1 cells. In conclusion, these microarray and real-time polymerase-chain reaction results indicate that BPA, a potential weak estrogen, may have estrogenic effect by regulating E(2)-responsive genes in ER-positive BG-1 cells and BG-1 cells would be the best in vitro model to detect these estrogenic EDCs.",PMC3145995

However, DES exposure in utero is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in adult women. Similarly, fetal exposure to BPA induces neoplastic changes in mammary tissue of mice. We hypothesized that epigenetic alterations would precede the increased risk of breast neoplasia after in utero exposure to endocrine disruptors. Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase that has been linked to breast cancer risk and epigenetic regulation of tumorigenesis. We examined the effect of BPA and DES on EZH2 expression and function in MCF-7 cells and in mammary glands of mice exposed in utero. DES and BPA treatment approximated human exposure. EZH2 functional activity was assessed by measuring histone H3 trimethylation. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with DES or BPA led to a 3- and 2-fold increase in EZH2 mRNA expression, respectively (p < 0.05) as well as increased EZH2 protein expression. Mice exposed to DES in utero showed a >2-fold increase in EZH2 expression in adult mammary tissue compared with controls (p < 0.05). EZH2 protein was elevated in mammary tissue of mice exposed to DES or BPA. Histone H3 trimethylation was increased in MCF-7 cells treated with BPA or DES. Similarly, mice exposed to BPA or DES in utero showed increased mammary histone H3 trimethylation. Developmental programming of EZH2 is a novel mechanism by which in utero exposure to endocrine disruptors leads to epigenetic regulation of the mammary gland.",PMC3140020

Bisphenol A is used extensively in the production of consumer goods, polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins and coatings used to line metallic food and beverage cans. There is great concern regarding the possible harmful effects from exposures that result from BPA leaching into foods and beverages from packaging or storage containers. The objective of this study was to independently assess whether BPA contamination of water was occurring from different types of reusable drinking bottles marketed as alternatives to BPA-containing polycarbonate plastics. Using a sensitive and quantitative BPA-specific competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we evaluated whether BPA migrated into water stored in polycarbonate or copolyester plastic bottles, and different lined or unlined metallic reusable water bottles. At room temperature the concentration of BPA migrating from polycarbonate bottles ranged from 0.2 to 0.3 mg L⁻¹. Under identical conditions BPA migration from aluminium bottles lined with epoxy-based resins was variable depending on manufacturer ranging from 0.08 to 1.9 mg L⁻¹. Boiling water significantly increased migration of BPA from the epoxy lined bottles. No detectable BPA contamination was observed in water stored in bottles made from Tritan™ copolyester plastic, uncoated stainless steel, or aluminium lined with EcoCare™. The results from this study demonstrate that when used according to manufacturers' recommendations reusable water bottles constructed from ""BPA-free"" alternative materials are suitable for consumption of beverages free of BPA contamination.",PMC3210908

The testis is an important target for PAHs, yet insufficient attention has been paid to their effects on steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. We hypothesized that long-term exposure to low concentrations of B[a]P might disrupt testosterone production in Leydig cells via an alteration of steroidogenic proteins. Oral exposure to B[a]P reduced serum and intratesticular fluid testosterone levels in rats. However, we did not observe serious testicular atrophy or azoospermia, although spermatogonial apoptosis was significantly increased. Compared with control cells, Leydig cells primed with B[a]P in vivo produced less testosterone in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or dibutyl cyclic adenosine monophosphate in vitro. Of note, the reduction of testosterone levels was accompanied by decreased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD), as well as increased levels of cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc), in Leydig cells. The up-regulation of P450scc expression after exposure to B[a]P appears to be associated with a compensatory mechanism for producing the maximum amount of pregnenolone with the minimum amount of transported cholesterol by StAR; the down-regulation of 3β-HSD may occur because B[a]P can negatively target 3β-HSD, which is required for testosterone production. B[a]P exposure can decrease epididymal sperm quality, possibly by disturbing testosterone levels, and StAR may be a major steroidogenic protein that is targeted by B[a]P or other PAHs.",PMC3226498

Expression of sexually selected traits that have evolved through intrasexual competition for mates and intersexual choice of mating partner are more dependent on developmental and physical condition of an animal than naturally selected traits and thus might be particularly vulnerable to disruption by developmental exposure to EDCs. We have used the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) as a model to test this hypothesis. Adult male-male competition for mates in this species is supported by enhanced spatial navigational and exploratory abilities, which enable males to search for prospective, widely dispersed females. Male deer mice exposed to BPA or ethinyl estradiol (EE) through maternal diet showed no changes in external phenotype, sensory development, or adult circulating concentrations of testosterone and corticosterone, but spatial learning abilities and exploratory behaviors were severely compromised compared with control males. Because these traits are not sexually selected in females, BPA exposure predictably had no effect, although EE-exposed females demonstrated enhanced spatial navigational abilities. Both BPA-exposed and control females preferred control males to BPA-exposed males. Our demonstration that developmental exposure to BPA compromises cognitive abilities and behaviors essential for males to reproduce successfully has broad implications for other species, including our own. Thus, sexually selected traits might provide useful biomarkers to assess risk of environmental contamination in animal and human populations.",PMC3136312

Diet is a primary route of exposure, but internal exposure (serum concentrations) in animals and humans has been measured only after single oral bolus administration. We compared serum concentrations of BPA over a 24-hr period after oral bolus administration or ad libitum feeding in mice and assessed for buildup with dietary exposure. Adult female mice were administered [dimethyl-d6]-BPA (BPA-d6) as a single oral bolus (20 mg/kg body weight) or fed a diet containing 100 mg BPA-d6/kg feed weight ad libitum for 1 week. Serum concentrations were analyzed using isotope dilution liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry and compared between exposure groups over the first 23 hr and after 7 days of dietary exposure. Maximum concentration (Cmax) for BPA-d6 during the first 24 hr was reached at 1 hr and 6 hr for oral bolus and diet groups, respectively. Relative BPA-d6 bioavailability (unconjugated BPA-d6) was higher in diet-exposed mice than in the bolus group despite a relative lower absorption, a phenomenon consistent with an inhibitory effect of food on first-pass hepatic metabolism. In mice with ongoing dietary exposure, unconjugated BPA-d6 was higher on day 7 than on day 1. This is the first report of serum BPA concentrations in an animal model exposed to this chemical via the diet. Although bolus administration of BPA-d6 led to peak concentrations within 1 hr, Cmax for diet-exposed mice was delayed for several hours. However, bolus administration underestimates bioavailable serum BPA concentrations in animals-and presumably humans-than would result from dietary exposure. Exposure via diet is a more natural continuous exposure route than oral bolus exposure and is thus a better predictor of BPA concentrations in chronically exposed animals and humans.",PMC3230401

EDs have profound effects on development and fertility. Imprinted genes had been identified as susceptible loci to environmental insults by EDs because they are functionally haploid, and because the imprints undergo epigenetic resetting between generations. To screen for possible epigenetic perturbations caused by EDs at imprinted loci, we treated pregnant mice daily between 8.5 and 12.5 days post coitum (dpc) with di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), bisphenol A (BPA), vinclozolin (VZ), or control oil vehicle. After isolating RNA from the placenta, yolk sac, amnion, head, body, heart, liver, lung, stomach, and intestines of 13.5 dpc embryos we measured the allele-specific expression of 38 imprinted transcripts using multiplex single nucleotide primer extension (SNuPE) assays. In this representative data set we identified only a small number of transcripts that exhibited a substantial relaxation of imprinted expression with statistical significance: Slc22a18 with 10% relaxation in the embryo after BPA treatment; Rtl1as with 11 and 16% relaxation in the lung and placenta, respectively after BPA treatment; and Rtl1 with 12% relaxation in the yolk sac after DEHP treatment. Additionally, the standard deviation of allele-specificity increased in various organs after ED treatment for several transcripts including Igf2r, Rasgrf1, Usp29, Slc38a4, and Xist.

These analogs include brominated [e.g., tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA)] and chlorinated [e.g., tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA)] bisphenols, which are both flame retardants. Because of their structural homology with BPA, such chemicals are candidate endocrine disruptors. However, their possible target(s) within the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily has remained unknown. We investigated whether BPA and its halogenated analogs could be ligands of estrogen receptors (ERs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and act as endocrine-disrupting chemicals. We studied the activity of compounds using reporter cell lines expressing ERs and PPARs. We measured the binding affinities to PPARγ by competitive binding assays with [3H]-rosiglitazone and investigated the impact of TBBPA and TCBPA on adipocyte differentiation using NIH3T3-L1 cells. Finally, we determined the binding mode of halogenated BPAs to PPARγ by X-ray crystallography. We observed that TBBPA and TCBPA are human, zebrafish, and Xenopus PPARγ ligands and determined the mechanism by which these chemicals bind to and activate PPARγ. We also found evidence that activation of ERα, ERβ, and PPARγ depends on the degree of halogenation in BPA analogs. We observed that the bulkier brominated BPA analogs, the greater their capability to activate PPARγ and the weaker their estrogenic potential.

We hypothesized that disruption of these processes by gestational PCB exposure would be detectable as early as the day after birth (postnatal day (P) 1) through alterations in hypothalamic gene and protein expression. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were injected twice, once each on gestational days 16 and 18, with one of the following: DMSO vehicle; the industrial PCB mixture Aroclor 1221 (A1221); a reconstituted mixture of the three most prevalent congeners found in humans, PCB138, PCB153, and PCB180; or estradiol benzoate (EB). On P1, litter composition, anogenital distance (AGD), and body weight were assessed. Pups were euthanized for immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor α (ERα) or TUNEL labeling of apoptotic cells or quantitative PCR of 48 selected genes in the preoptic area (POA). We found that treatment with EB or A1221 had a sex-specific effect on developmental apoptosis in the neonatal anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), a sexually dimorphic hypothalamic region involved in the regulation of reproductive neuroendocrine function. In this region, exposed females had increased numbers of apoptotic nuclei, whereas there was no effect of treatment in males. For ERα, EB treatment increased immunoreactive cell numbers and density in the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) of both males and females, while A1221 and the PCB mixture had no effect. PCR analysis of gene expression in the POA identified nine genes that were significantly altered by prenatal EDC exposure, in a manner that varied by sex and treatment. These genes included brain-derived neurotrophic factor, GABA(B) receptors-1 and -2, IGF-1, kisspeptin receptor, NMDA receptor subunits NR2b and NR2c, prodynorphin, and TGFα.

Concerns have been raised that BPA acts as an endocrine disruptor on both developmental and reproductive processes and a large body of evidence suggests that BPA interferes with estrogen and thyroid hormone signaling. Here, we investigated BPA effects during embryonic development using the zebrafish and Xenopus models. We report that BPA exposure leads to severe malformations of the otic vesicle. In zebrafish and in Xenopus embryos, exposure to BPA during the first developmental day resulted in dose-dependent defects in otolith formation. Defects included aggregation, multiplication and occasionally failure to form otoliths. As no effects on otolith development were seen with exposure to micromolar concentrations of thyroid hormone, 17-ß-estradiol or of the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 we conclude that the effects of BPA are independent of estrogen receptors or thyroid-hormone receptors. Na+/K+ ATPases are crucial for otolith formation in zebrafish. Pharmacological inhibition of the major Na+/K+ ATPase with ouabain can rescue the BPA-induced otolith phenotype.

By bioinformatically examining fetal testis expression microarray data sets from susceptible (rat) and resistant (mouse) species after dibutyl phthalate (DBP) exposure, we identified decreased expression of several metabolic pathways in both species. However, lipid metabolism pathways transcriptionally regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) were inhibited in the rat but induced in the mouse, and this differential species response corresponded with repression of the steroidogenic pathway. In rats exposed to 100 or 500 mg/kg DBP from gestational days (GD) 16 to 20, a correlation was observed between GD20 testis steroidogenic inhibition and reductions of testis cholesterol synthesis endpoints including testis total cholesterol levels, Srebf2 gene expression, and cholesterol synthesis pathway gene expression. SREBP2 expression was detected in all fetal rat testis cells but was highest in Leydig cells. Quantification of SREBP2 immunostaining showed that 500 mg/kg DBP exposure significantly reduced SREBP2 expression in rat fetal Leydig cells but not in seminiferous cords. By Western analysis, total rat testis SREBP2 levels were not altered by DBP exposure. Together, these data suggest that phthalate-induced inhibition of fetal testis steroidogenesis is closely associated with reduced activity of several lipid metabolism pathways and SREBP2-dependent cholesterologenesis in Leydig cells.",PMC3061485

Several of these endocrine disruptors have been shown to alter normal development and influence tumorigenesis in experimental models. N-butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), a widely used plasticizer, is a well-known endocrine disruptor. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of prenatal exposure to BBP on the morphology, proliferative index, and genomic signature of the rat mammary gland at different ages. In utero exposure was performed by gavage of pregnant Sprague Dawley CD rats with 120mg or 500mg BBP/kg/day from day 10 post-conception to delivery. Female litters were euthanized at 21, 35, 50 and 100 days. The morphology and proliferative index of the mammary gland were studied from whole mount preparations and BrdU incorporation, respectively. Gene expression profile was assessed by microarrays. Several genes found differentially expressed and related to different functional categories were further validated by real time RT-PCR. Prenatal exposure of BBP induced delayed vaginal opening and changes in the post-natal mammary gland long after the end of the treatment, mainly by 35 days of age. Exposure to the high dose resulted in modifications in architecture and proliferative index of the mammary gland, mostly affecting the undifferentiated terminal end buds. Moreover, the expression profiles of this gland in the exposed rats were modified in a dose-dependent fashion. Analysis of functional categories showed that modified genes were related to immune function, cell signaling, proliferation and differentiation, or metabolism. Our data suggest that in utero exposure to BBP induced a delayed pubertal onset and modified morphology of the mammary gland. These alterations were accompanied by modifications in gene expression previously associated with an increased susceptibility to carcinogenesis.",PMC3033239

Innate defense against small molecule exposures is controlled in large part by the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR). The human CAR gene undergoes multiple alternative splicing events resulting in the CAR2 and CAR3 variant receptors. Recent studies from our laboratory show that CAR2 is potently and specifically activated by di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). We hypothesized that alternative splicing is a mechanism for increasing CAR's functional diversity, broadening the human receptors' repertoire of response to environmental xenobiotics. In these studies, we examine the interaction of alternatively spliced CARs and PXR with a range of suspected endocrine disruptors, including phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), and 4-N-nonylphenol (NP). Transactivation and two-hybrid studies in COS-1 cells revealed differential selectivity of endocrine-disrupting chemicals for the variant CAR and PXR. Ex vivo studies showed DEHP and di-isononyl phthalate potently induced CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 expression in human hepatocytes. Mutation analysis of CAR2, in silico modeling, and ligand docking studies suggested that the SPTV amino acid insertion of CAR2 creates a unique ligand-binding pocket. Alternative gene splicing results in variant CAR receptors that selectively recognize phthalates and BPA.

Estrone is often the dominant natural estrogen in urban sewage, yet little is known about its environmental fate and biological effects. Increased use of UV-B radiation for effluent treatments, and exposure of effluents to sunlight in holding ponds led us to examine the effects of environmentally relevant levels of UV-B radiation on the photodegradation potential of estrone. Surprisingly, UV-B-mediated degradation leads to the photoproduction of lumiestrone, a little known 13α-epimer form of estrone. We show for the first time that lumiestrone possesses novel biological activity. In vivo treatment with estrone stimulated estrogen receptor (ER) α mRNA production in the male goldfish liver, whereas lumiestrone was without effect, suggesting a total loss of estrogenicity. In contrast, results from in vitro ER-dependent reporter gene assays indicate that lumiestrone showed relatively higher estrogenic potency with the zebrafish ERβ2 than zfERα, suggesting that it may act through an ERβ-selectivity. Lumiestrone also activated human ERs. Microarray analysis of male goldfish liver following in vivo treatments showed that lumiestrone respectively up- and down-regulated 20 and 69 mRNAs, which was indicative of metabolic upsets and endocrine activities.

Ten or more members of the PE class of compounds are known to induce male fetal endocrine toxicity and postnatal reproductive malformations by disrupting androgen production during the sexual differentiation period of development. An early study conducted in the rat pubertal model suggested that dipentyl phthalate (DPeP) may be a more potent testicular toxicant than some more extensively studied phthalates. Regulatory agencies require dose-response and potency data to facilitate risk assessment; however, very little data are currently available for DPeP. The goal of this study was to establish a more comprehensive data set for DPeP, focusing on dose-response and potency information for fetal and postnatal male reproductive endpoints. We dosed pregnant rats on gestational day (GD) 17 or GD 14-18 and subsequently evaluated fetal testicular testosterone (T) production on GD 17.5 and GD 18, respectively. We also dosed pregnant rats on GD 8-18 and evaluated early postnatal endpoints in male offspring. Comparison of these data to data previously obtained under similar conditions for di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate indicates that DPeP is approximately eightfold more potent in reducing fetal T production and two- to threefold more potent in inducing development of early postnatal male reproductive malformations. Additionally, fetal testicular T production was more sensitive to inhibitory effects of DPeP exposure than was gene expression of target genes involved in male reproductive development, supporting the use of this endpoint as a critical effect in the risk assessment process.",PMC3044206

Despite these important roles, it remains unclear whether the PG pathway is a target for endocrine disruption. However, several known endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) share a high degree of structural similarity with mild analgesics. Using cell-based transfection and transduction experiments, mass spectrometry, and organotypic assays together with molecular modeling, we investigated whether inhibition of the PG pathway by known EDCs could be a novel point of endocrine disruption. We found that many known EDCs inhibit the PG pathway in a mouse Sertoli cell line and in human primary mast cells. The EDCs also reduced PG synthesis in ex vivo rat testis, and this reduction was correlated with a reduced testosterone production. The inhibition of PG synthesis occurred without involvement of canonical PG receptors or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which have previously been described as targets of EDCs. Instead, our results suggest that the compounds may bind directly into the active site of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby obstructing the conversion of arachidonic acid to PG precursors without interfering with the expression of the COX enzymes. A common feature of the PG inhibitory EDCs is the presence of aromatic groups that may stabilize binding in the hydrophobic active site of the COX enzymes. Our findings suggest a hitherto unknown mode of action by EDCs through inhibition of the PG pathway and suggest new avenues to investigate effects of EDCs on reproductive and immunological disorders that have become increasingly common in recent decades.",PMC3080937

A complete understanding of how these compounds affect health is complicated because environmental estrogens are a structurally heterogeneous group of compounds. In this work, computational molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to predict the binding affinity of different compounds using rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) estrogen receptors (ERs) as a model. Specifically, this study presents a comparison of the binding affinity of the natural ligand estradiol-17β to the four rainbow trout ER isoforms with that of three known environmental estrogens 17α-ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, and raloxifene. Two additional compounds, atrazine and testosterone, that are known to be very weak or non-binders to ERs were tested. The binding affinity of these compounds to the human ERα subtype is also included for comparison. The results of this study suggest that, when compared to estradiol-17β, bisphenol A binds less strongly to all four receptors, 17α-ethinylestradiol binds more strongly, and raloxifene has a high affinity for the α subtype only. The results also show that atrazine and testosterone are weak or non-binders to the ERs. All of the results are in excellent qualitative agreement with the known in vivo estrogenicity of these compounds in the rainbow trout and other fishes. Computational estimation of binding affinities could be a valuable tool for predicting the impact of environmental estrogens in fish and other animals.",PMC3022107

We used multivariate ordinary least squares linear regression models to examine the association of BPA and triclosan with CMV antibody titers, and multivariate logistic regression models to investigate the association of these chemicals with allergy or hay fever diagnosis. Statistical models were stratified by age (< 18 years and ≥ 18 years). In analyses adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index, creatinine levels, family income, and educational attainment, in the ≥ 18-year age group, higher urinary BPA levels were associated with higher CMV antibody titers (p < 0.001). In the < 18-year age group, lower levels of BPA were associated with higher CMV antibody titers (p < 0.05). However, triclosan, but not BPA, showed a positive association with allergy or hay fever diagnosis.

Several of these contaminants that are not able to bind to mammalian estrogen receptors (such as atrazine and cyanazine) have previously been reported to bind to the alligator estrogen receptor from oviductal tissue. Binding of known Lake Apopka contaminants to full length estrogen receptors alpha from human (hERalpha) and alligator (aERalpha) was assessed in a side-by-side comparison within the same assay system. Baculovirus-expressed recombinant hERalpha and aERalpha were used in a competitive binding assay. Atrazine and cyanazine were not able to bind to either receptor. p,p'-Dicofol was able to bind to aERalpha with a concentration inhibiting 50% of binding (IC50) of 4 microM, while only partially displacing 17beta-estradiol (E2) from hERalpha and yielding a projected IC50 of 45 microM. Chemicals that only partially displaced E2 from either receptor, including some dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolites and trans-nonachlor, appeared to have higher affinity for aERalpha than hERalpha. p,p'-Dicofol-mediated transcriptional activation through aERalpha and hERalpha was assessed to further explore the preferential binding of p,p'-dicofol to aERalpha over hERalpha. p,p'-Dicofol was able to stimulate transcriptional activation in a similar manner with both receptors. However, the in vitro results obtained with p,p'-dicofol were not reflected in an in vivo mammalian model, where Kelthane (mixed o,p'- and p,p'-dicofol isomers) did not elicit estrogenic effects.

Prenatal exposure of the dam to 250 microg BPA/kg BW combined with a single exposure of female offspring to DMBA on PND100, but not on PND50, significantly increased tumor incidence while decreasing tumor latency compared with the control group. Prenatal exposure of the dam to 250 microg BPA/kg BW, in the absence of DMBA to the female offspring, increased cell proliferation and elicited differential effects at the protein level at PND100 compared with PND50.

PCB153 is one of the most commonly found polychlorinated biphenyls, and based on epidemiological studies, has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. The endocrine disruptor PCB153 has been reported to bind the estrogen receptor alpha, induce vessel formation, and increase the formation of reactive oxygen species in endothelial cells. Since PCB153-induced phenotypic changes are similar to estradiol, we postulated that PCB153 activates redox signaling pathways common to 17β-estradiol. Whether the effect of PCB153 on the proteome is comparable to 17β-estradiol is not known. Therefore we investigated the proteome of human microvascular endothelial cells exposed to PCB153 (100 ng/ml) for 24 h. Using 2D DIGE coupled to MALDI-time of flight (TOF)/TOF MS, we found 96 protein spots significantly (greater than 1.5-fold) modulated by experimental treatments. Mass spectrometry identified 11 of 13 protein spots with high confidence protein score CI that was greater than 95%. Of the identified proteins, lamin A/C and far upstream element-binding protein (FUBP1) were regulated similarly by both treatments. FUBP1 is of particular interest because it controls c-myc. While lamin A/C modulates transcription factor AP-1 function. Interestingly, both c-myc and AP-1 are redox-sensitive transcription factors known to regulate genes required for cell growth. Network analysis of these proteins showed transforming growth factor β-1 and c-myc to play central roles.

GnRH mRNA expression was significantly lower in both groups of EDC-treated females compared to controls. ESR1 expression was increased in prenatal BPA- but not MXC-treated females in medial preoptic area relative to controls. In contrast, ESR2 expression was reduced in the medial preoptic area of both EDC-treated groups.

We tested the hypothesis that BPA activates Maxi-K channels through a mechanism that depends upon the regulatory beta1 subunit. Patch-clamp recordings of Maxi-K channels were made in human and canine coronary smooth muscle cells as well as in AD-293 cells expressing pore-forming alpha or alpha plus beta1 subunits. BPA (10 microM) activated an outward current in smooth muscle cells that was inhibited by penitrem A (1 microM), a Maxi-K blocker. BPA increased Maxi-K activity in inside-out patches from coronary smooth muscle, but had no effect on single channel conductance. In AD-293 cells with Maxi-K channels composed of alpha subunits alone, 10 microM BPA did not affect channel activity. When channels in AD-293 cells contained beta1 subunits, 10 microM BPA increased channel activity. Effects of BPA were rapid (<1 min) and reversible. A higher concentration of BPA (100 microM) increased Maxi-K current independent of the beta1 subunit.

Flow cytometry results showed that Fen enhanced the escape of cells from the G(0)-G(1) checkpoint and promoted progression of both cell types into the S phase. An Annexin V assay showed that Fen had an anti-apoptotic effect on both cell types. By Real-time PCR, we found that collagen I mRNA expression increased (p < 0.05) in Fen-treated cells compared to controls, although it was greater in UtLM tumor cells. Accordingly, Fen increased (p < 0.05) collagen I protein levels in both cell lysate and supernatant when compared to controls. To further test the mechanism of Fen's effects, transactivation and competitive binding assays were done. The results showed Fen did not significantly stimulate luciferase activity at concentrations of 0.1 microM, 1.0 microM or 10.0 microM in either of the cell types. Competitive binding assays revealed that the affinity of Fen binding to estrogen receptors (ERs) was non-detectable compared to E(2). Our data show that Fen can stimulate the growth of both UtLM cells and UtSMC, which involves a combination of enhanced cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis. Also this compound can increase collagen I expression, at both mRNA and protein levels.

Hoxa10 mRNA and protein expression were increased by 25% in the reproductive tract of mice exposed in utero. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that cytosine-guanine dinucleotide methylation was decreased from 67 to 14% in the promoter and from 71 to 3% in the intron of Hoxa10 after in utero BPA exposure. Decreased DNA methylation led to an increase in binding of ER-alpha to the Hoxa10 ERE both in vitro as and in vivo as determined by EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation, respectively. Diminished methylation of the ERE-containing promoter sequence resulted in an increase in ERE-driven gene expression in reporter assays. We identify altered methylation as a novel mechanism of BPA-induced altered developmental programming. Permanent epigenetic alteration of ERE sensitivity to estrogen may be a general mechanism through which endocrine disruptors exert their action.",PMC3230522

This work aims to fill this gap by assessing the effects of bisphenol A (BPA) and vinclozolin (Vz) on the terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber (common rough woodlouse). Male adult and sexually undifferentiated juvenile woodlice were exposed to the toxicants. Effects on molting regime and growth were investigated independently for males and female woodlice after sexual differentiation. Both chemicals elicited developmental toxicity to P. scaber by causing overall decreased growth. Nevertheless, BPA induced molting, whereas Vz delayed it. Although the LC50 values for juvenile and adult survival were fairly similar, juvenile woodlice showed an increased chronic sensitivity to both chemicals, and female woodlice were most the sensitive to BPA. We recommend the use of adults, juveniles, female, and male woodlice, as well as a large range of toxicant concentrations, to provide valuable information regarding differential dose responses, effects, and threshold values for EDCs.",PMC2908429

We investigated whether BPA affects human ovarian granulosa cell function. We treated KGN granulosa cells and granulosa cells from subjects undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), BPA, or BPA plus FSH in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We then evaluated expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), aromatase, and transcription factors known to mediate aromatase induction by FSH [including steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), GATA4, cAMP response element binding protein-1 (CREB-1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma)], as well as 17beta-estradiol (E2) secretion. KGN cells were transfected with a PPARgamma-containing vector, followed by assessment of aromatase and IGF-I expression. BPA reduced FSH-induced IGF-1 and aromatase expression and E2 secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Similar effects on aromatase were observed in IVF granulosa cells. SF-1 and GATA4, but not CREB-1, were reduced after BPA treatment, although PPARgamma, an inhibitor of aromatase, was significantly up-regulated by BPA in a dose-dependent manner, with simultaneous decrease of aromatase. Overexpression of PPARgamma in KGN cells reduced FSH-stimulated aromatase and IGF-1 mRNAs, with increasing concentrations of the transfected expression vector, mimicking BPA action. Also, BPA reduced granulosa cell DNA synthesis without changing DNA fragmentation, suggesting that BPA does not induce apoptosis. Overall, the data demonstrate that BPA induces PPARgamma, which mediates down-regulation of FSH-stimulated IGF-1, SF-1, GATA4, aromatase, and E2 in human granulosa cells. These observations support a potential role of altered steroidogenesis and proliferation within the ovarian follicular compartment due to this endocrine disruptor.",PMC2854770

The aim of this study was to test a hypothesis that EDCs regulate the functions of human dendritic cells, a front-line, immunoregulatory cell type in contact with the environment. We investigated circulating myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) from five subjects and measured their responses, with or without coculture with autologous T cells, to two common EDCs, nonylphenol (NP) and 4-octylphenol (4-OP). EDC-associated cytokine responses, signaling events, and histone modifications were examined using ELISA, Western blotting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, respectively. In all cases, mDCs treated with NP or 4-OP demonstrated increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) but decreased baseline and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced (interleukin) (IL)-10 production; the increase in TNF-alpha was partially reversible by an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist. Activation of the MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathway marked the effect of NP on TNF-alpha expression, concomitant with enhanced levels of methyltranferase complex [mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) and tryptophan-aspartic acid repeat domain 5 (WDR5)] in the nucleus and of trimethylated H3K4, acetylated H3, and H4 at the TNFA gene locus. Further, up-regulated TNF-alpha expression was significantly suppressed in NP-treated mDCs by a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor. In the presence of NP-treated mDCs, T cells showed increased levels of IL-13 but decreased expression of interferon-gamma. These results suggest that NP and 4-OP may have functional effects on the response of mDCs via, in part, the ER, MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signaling pathway, and histone modifications, with subsequent influence on the T-cell cytokine responses.",PMC2831970

Large numbers of environmental pollutants have been screened to identify such compounds; however, not until recently was 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (TBECH) identified as the first potent activator of the human androgen receptor (hAR). TBECH has been found in beluga whales and bird eggs and has also been found to be maternally transferred in zebrafish. In the present study we investigated interaction energies between TBECH diastereomers (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) and the hAR, and their ability to activate the receptor and induce prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression in vitro. We performed computational modeling to determine interaction energies between the ligand and the AR ligand-binding site, and measured in vitro competitive binding assays for AR by polarization fluorometry analysis. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to determine PSA activity in LNCaP and HepG2 cells. We found the gamma and delta diastereomers to be more potent activators of hAR than the alpha and beta diastereomers, which was confirmed in receptor binding studies. All TBECH diastereomers induced PSA expression in LNCaP cells even though the AR present in these cells is mutated (T877A). Modeling studies of LNCaP AR revealed that TBECH diastereomers bound to the receptor with a closer distance to the key amino acids in the ligand-binding domain, indicating stronger binding to the mutated receptor. The present study demonstrates the ability of TBECH to activate the hAR, indicating that it is a potential endocrine disruptor.",PMC2799458

The primary metabolite of EGME is methoxyacetic acid (MAA), a short-chain fatty acid that inhibits histone deacetylase activity and alters gene expression. Because estrogen signaling is necessary for normal reproductive function and modulates gene expression, the estrogen-signaling pathway is a likely target for MAA; however, little is known about the effects of MAA in this regard. We evaluated the mechanistic effects of MAA on estrogen receptor (ER) expression and estrogen signaling using in vitro and in vivo model systems. MAA potentiates 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) stimulation of an estrogen-responsive reporter plasmid in HeLa cells transiently transfected with either a human ERalpha or ERbeta expression vector containing a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. This result is attributed to increased exogenous ER expression due to MAA-mediated activation of the CMV promoter. In contrast to its effects on exogenous ER, MAA decreases endogenous ERalpha expression and attenuates E(2)-stimulated endogenous gene expression in both MCF-7 cells and the mouse uterus. These results illustrate the importance of careful experimental design and analysis when assessing the potential endocrine-disrupting properties of a compound to ensure biological responses are in concordance with in vitro analyses. Given the established role of the ER in normal reproductive function, the effects of MAA on the endogenous ER reported here are consistent with the reproductive abnormalities observed after EGME exposure and suggest that these toxicities may be due, at least in part, to attenuation of endogenous ER-mediated signaling.",PMC2801194

Verifying such links requires animal models exposed to ""real-life,"" environmentally relevant concentrations/mixtures of EDC, particularly in utero, when sensitivity to EDC exposure is maximal. We evaluated the effects of maternal exposure to a pollutant cocktail (sewage sludge) on the ovine fetal reproductive neuroendocrine axes, particularly the kisspeptin (KiSS-1)/GPR54 (G-protein-coupled receptor 54) system. KiSS-1, GPR54, and ERalpha (estrogen receptor alpha) mRNA expression was quantified in control (C) and treated (T) maternal and fetal (110-day) hypothalami and pituitary glands using semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and colocalization of kisspeptin with LHbeta (luteinizing hormone beta) and ERalpha in C and T fetal pituitary glands quantified using dual-labeling immunohistochemistry. Fetuses exposed in utero to the EDC mixture showed reduced KiSS-1 mRNA expression across three hypothalamic regions examined (rostral, mid, and caudal) and had fewer kisspetin immunopositive cells colocalized with both LHbeta and ERalpha in the pituitary gland. In contrast, treatment had no effect on parameters measured in the adult ewe hypothalamus or pituitary. This study demonstrates that the developing fetus is sensitive to real-world mixtures of environmental chemicals, which cause significant neuroendocrine alterations. The important role of kisspeptin/GPR54 in regulating puberty and adult reproduction means that in utero disruption of this system is likely to have long-term consequences in adulthood and represents a novel, additional pathway through which environmental chemicals perturb human reproduction.",PMC2790510

Implication of environmental endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol A (BPA) on adipose tissue development has been poorly investigated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of perinatal exposure to BPA on early adipose storage at weaning. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats had access to drinking water containing 1 mg/L BPA from day 6 of gestation through the end of lactation. Pups were weaned on postnatal day (PND) 21. At that time, we investigated perigonadal adipose tissue of pups (weight, histology, gene expression). For the remaining animals, we recorded body weight and food intake for animals on either standard chow or a high-fat diet. Gestational exposure to BPA did not alter the sex ratio or litter size at birth. On PND1, the weight of male and female BPA-exposed pups was increased. On PND21, body weight was increased only in females, in which parametrial white adipose tissue (pWAT) weight was increased about 3-fold. This excess of pWAT was associated with adipocyte hypertrophy and overexpression of lipogenic genes such as C/EBP-alpha (CAAT enhancer binding protein alpha), PPAR-gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma), SREBP-1C (sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C), LPL (lipoprotein lipase), FAS (fatty acid synthase), and SCD-1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1). In addition, gene expression of SREBP-1C, FAS, and ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) was also increased in liver from BPA-exposed females at PND21, without a change in circulating lipids and glucose. After weaning, perinatal BPA exposure predisposed to overweight in a sex- and diet-dependent manner. We observed no change in food intake due to perinatal BPA exposure in rats on either standard chow or a high-fat diet. Perinatal exposure to a low dose of BPA increased adipogenesis in females at weaning. Adult body weight may be programmed during early life, leading to changes dependent on the sex and the nutritional status. Although further studies are required to understand the mechanisms of BPA action in early life, these results are particularly important with regard to the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity and the context-dependent action of endocrine disruptors.",PMC2790509

Hardly any data on its chemical pollution by polar organic pollutants are available in literature. This study focused on the presence and sources of a series of phenolic endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in this area, including parabens, alkylphenolic compounds and bisphenol-A (BPA). A number of possible sources of pollution are present in the area, including the large harbours present in the lagoon, the city of Aveiro and the rivers discharging into the area. A recently constructed submarine wastewater outfall, located a few kilometres from the lagoon inlet has also been suggested as a possible source of pollution to Ria de Aveiro in several publications. The aim of the current field study was to investigate the occurrence and main sources of phenolic endocrine disruptors in Ria de Aveiro. An extensive sampling campaign was performed, with surface water and wastewater grab samples taken at over 50 locations, in duplicate on different days. Samples were treated using solid phase extraction and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations in lagoon water were generally low: not exceeding 20 ng/L for most analytes. Levels in river water exceeded those in the lagoon by a factor 3 to 500 (o-phenylphenol (PhP) and nonylphenoxy ethoxy acetic acids (A9PEC), respectively), with concentrations up to 700 ng/L for BPA and 7,300 ng/L for A9PEC. Samples from the harbours showed EDC levels similar to those in the rest of the lagoon, but in the city of Aveiro, elevated concentrations were observed for alkylphenol ethoxylates (A9PEO), A9PEC, PhP and BPA. Wastewater effluents showed low levels for parabens, whilst alkylphenolic compounds reached several micrograms per litre. The effluents are discharged into the ocean via a submarine outfall, but as marine water near the outfall showed slightly elevated concentrations only for A9PEO, it does not seem to be a significant source of these EDCs for the area. All the studied phenolic EDCs were detected in the study area, with high levels found in some of the rivers discharging into the lagoon, and generally low concentrations in the lagoon itself. The main sources for all investigated EDCs were the rivers Caster and Antuã which discharge into the lagoon. The city of Aveiro was identified as a secondary source. As the tidal water exchange volume is much larger than the freshwater input from the rivers, concentrations of phenolic EDCs remained low in the lagoon.",PMC2854360

Recently, attention has focused on the potential contributions of environmental pollutants that act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases. Because glucocorticoid signaling is central to adipocyte differentiation, the ability of EDCs to stimulate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and drive adipogenesis was assessed in the 3T3-L1 cell line. Various EDCs were screened for glucocorticoid-like activity using a luciferase reporter construct, and four (bisphenol A (BPA), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), endrin, and tolylfluanid (TF)) were shown to significantly stimulate GR without significant activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were then treated with EDCs and a weak differentiation cocktail containing dehydrocorticosterone (DHC) in place of the synthetic dexamethasone. The capacity of these compounds to promote adipogenesis was assessed by quantitative oil red O staining and immunoblotting for adipocyte-specific proteins. The four EDCs increased lipid accumulation in the differentiating adipocytes and also upregulated the expression of adipocytic proteins. Interestingly, proadipogenic effects were observed at picomolar concentrations for several of the EDCs. Because there was no detectable adipogenesis when the preadipocytes were treated with compounds alone, the EDCs are likely promoting adipocyte differentiation by synergizing with agents present in the differentiation cocktail. Thus, EDCs are able to promote adipogenesis through the activation of the GR, further implicating these compounds in the rising rates of obesity and diabetes.",PMC3957336

To further investigate these effects, we used an immature rat model to examine the effects of di-(2 ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and flutamide (Flu) on the male reproductive system. Immature male SD rats were treated daily with DEHP and Flu on postnatal days (PNDs) 21 to 35, in a dose-dependent manner. As results, the weights of the testes, prostate, and seminal vesicle and anogenital distances (AGD) decreased significantly in response to high doses of DEHP or Flu. Testosterone (T) levels significantly decreased in all DEHP- treated groups, whereas luteinizing hormone (LH) plasma levels were not altered by any of the two treatments at PND 36. However, treatment with DEHP or Flu induced histopathological changes in the testes, wherein degeneration and disorders of Leydig cells, germ cells and dilatation of tubular lumen were observed in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, hyperplasia and denseness of Leydig, Sertoli and germ cells were observed in rats given with high doses of Flu. The results by cDNA microarray analysis indicated that 1,272 genes were up-regulated by more than two-fold, and 1,969 genes were down-regulated in response to DEHP, Flu or both EDs. These genes were selected based on their markedly increased or decreased expression levels. These genes have been also classified on the basis of gene ontology (e.g., steroid hormone biosynthetic process, regulation of transcription, signal transduction, metabolic process, biosynthetic process...). Significant decreases in gene expression were observed in steroidogenic genes (i.e., Star, Cyp11a1 and Hsd3b). In addition, the expression of a common set of target genes, including CaBP1, Vav2, Plcd1, Lhx1 and Isoc1, was altered following exposure to EDs, suggesting that they may be marker genes to screen for the anti-androgenic or androgenic effects of EDs. Overall, our results demonstrated that exposure to DEHP, Flu or both EDs resulted in a alteration of gene expression in the testes of immature male rats. Furthermore, the toxicological effects of these EDs on the male reproductive system resulted from their anti-androgenic effects. Taken together, these results provide a new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the detrimental impacts of EDs, in regards to anti-androgenic effects in humans and wildlife.",PMC2760555

We collected fasting serum samples from 703 adult Mohawks (257 men and 436 women) and analyzed samples for 101 PCB congeners, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and mirex, as well as testosterone, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The associations between testosterone and tertiles of serum organochlorine levels (both wet weight and lipid adjusted) were assessed using a logistic regression model while controlling for age, body mass index (BMI), and other analytes, with the lowest tertile being considered the referent. Males and females were considered separately. Testosterone concentrations in males were inversely correlated with total PCB concentration, whether using wet-weight or lipid-adjusted values. The odds ratio (OR) of having a testosterone concentration above the median was 0.17 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.05-0.69] for total wet-weight PCBs (highest vs. lowest tertile) after adjustment for age, BMI, total serum lipids, and three pesticides. The OR for lipid-adjusted total PCB concentration was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.06-0.78) after adjustment for other analytes.

Urine was collected for 24 h (on dry ice using all glass metabolism chambers) from dams on gestational day 18 (during exposure) and on post natal day (pnd) 21, and from pnd 25 pups. Traditional phenotypic anchors were measured in pups (between pnd 0 and pnd 26). Metabolomics of urine collected from dams exposed to vehicle or BBP exhibited different patterns for endogenous metabolites. Even three weeks after gestational exposure, metabolic profiles of endogenous compounds in urine could differentiate dams that received the vehicle, low dose or high dose of BBP. Metabolic profiles could differentiate male from female pups, pups born to dams receiving the vehicle, low or high BBP dose, and pups with observable adverse reproductive effects from pups with no observed effects.

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression models that stratified associations of POP exposure and TGCT risk by genotype. Two polymorphisms in CYP1A1, rs1456432 and rs7495708, modified the association between trans-nonachlor and total chlordanes and TGCT risk. Among men with a minor allele for rs1456432, those with the highest quartiles had an increased risk of TGCT (OR = 1.90, 95% CI, 1.01-3.56) compared with those with the lowest; there was no increased risk among men with the homozygous major allele genotype (p-interactions = 0.024).

Further, although not statistically different from the controls, prominent mesonephric (Wolffian) remnants and squamous metaplasia of the uterus, as well as vaginal adenosis, were present in BPA-treated mice, similar to lesions reported following DES treatment. More severe pathologies observed in some BPA-treated animals included atypical hyperplasia and stromal polyps of the uterus; sarcoma of the uterine cervix; and mammary adenocarcinoma.

Much of this occurs in discrete developmental windows that span gestation through the prenatal period, although it is now becoming clear that at least some of this process continues through puberty. Perturbation of this developmental progression can permanently alter the capacity for reproductive success. Wildlife studies have revealed that exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), either naturally occurring or man made, can profoundly alter reproductive physiology and ultimately impact entire populations. Laboratory studies in rodents and other species have elucidated some of the mechanisms by which this occurs and strongly indicate that humans are also vulnerable to disruption. Use of hormonally active compounds in human medicine has also unfortunately revealed that the developing fetus can be exposed to and affected by endocrine disruptors, and that it might take decades for adverse effects to manifest. Research within the field of environmental endocrine disruption has also contributed to the general understanding of how early life experiences can alter reproductive physiology and behavior through non-genomic, epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation.

It has been reported that BPA increases the cell proliferation activity of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells as well as 17-beta estradiol (E2) and diethylstilbestrol (DES). However, BPA induces target genes through ER-dependent and ER-independent manners which are different from the actions induced by E2. Therefore, BPA may be unique in estrogen-dependent cell proliferation compared to other endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). In the present study, to test whether ERalpha is essential to the BPA-induced proliferation on MCF-7 cells, we suppressed the ERalpha expression of MCF-7 cells by RNA interference (RNAi). Proliferation effects in the presence of E2, DES and BPA were not observed in ERalpha-knockdown MCF-7 cells in comparison with control MCF-7. In addition, a marker of proliferative potential, MIB-1 labeling index (LI), showed no change in BPA-treated groups compared with vehicle-treated groups on ERalpha-knockdown MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated that ERalpha has a role in BPA-induced cell proliferation as well as E2 and DES. Moreover, this study indicated that the direct knockdown of ERalpha using RNAi serves as an additional tool to evaluate, in parallel with MCF-7 cell proliferation assay, for potential EDCs.",PMC2685020

We examined low concentrations of XEs [dieldrin, endosulfan, o', p'-dichlorodiphenyl-ethylene (DDE), nonylphenol (NP), and bisphenol A (BPA)] for nongenomic actions via action of membrane estrogen receptors (ERs). We measured activity of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by the efflux of 3H-dopamine in nontransfected nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells expressing membrane DAT, ER-alpha, ER-beta, and G-protein-coupled receptor 30. We used a plate immunoassay to monitor trafficking of these proteins. All compounds at 1 nM either caused efflux or inhibited efflux, or both; each compound evoked a distinct oscillatory pattern. At optimal times for each effect, we examined different concentrations of XEs. All XEs were active at some concentration < 10 nM, and dose responses were all nonmonotonic. For example, 10(-14) to 10(-11) M DDE caused significant efflux inhibition, whereas NP and BPA enhanced or inhibited efflux at several concentrations. We also measured the effects of E2/XE combinations; DDE potentiated E(2)-mediated dopamine efflux, whereas BPA inhibited it. In E2-induced efflux, 15% more ER-alpha trafficked to the membrane, whereas ER-beta waned; during BPA-induced efflux, 20% more DAT was trafficked to the plasma membrane. Low levels of environmental estrogen contaminants acting as endocrine disruptors via membrane ERs can alter dopamine efflux temporal patterning and the trafficking of DAT and membrane ERs, providing a cellular mechanism that could explain the disruption of physiologic neurotransmitter function.",PMC2685841

Growing evidence suggests that kisspeptin (KISS) neurons play a significant role in the regulation of pubertal onset and ovulation, therefore disruption of KISS signaling could be a mechanism by which EDCs impair reproductive maturation and function. We have previously demonstrated that neonatal exposure to phytoestrogens decreases KISS fiber density in the anterior hypothalamus of female rats, an effect which was associated with early persistent estrus and the impaired activation gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. The goals of the present study were to (1) determine if an ERalpha selective agonist (PPT) or bisphenol-A (BPA) could produce similar effects on hypothalamic KISS content in female rats and (2) to determine if male KISS fiber density was also vulnerable to disruption by EDCs. We first examined the effects of neonatal exposure to PPT, a low (50 microg/kg bw) BPA dose, and a high (50 mg/kg bw) BPA dose on KISS immunoreactivity (-ir) in the anterior ventral periventricular (AVPV) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei of adult female rats, using estradiol benzoate (EB) and a sesame oil vehicle as controls. AVPV KISS-ir, following ovariectomy (OVX) and hormone priming, was significantly lower in the EB and PPT groups but not the BPA groups. ARC KISS-ir levels were significantly diminished in the EB and high dose BPA groups, and there was a nonsignificant trend for lower KISS-ir in the PPT group. We next examined effects of neonatal exposure to a low (50 microg/kg bw) dose of BPA and the phytoestrogens genistein (GEN) and equol (EQ) on KISS-ir in the AVPV and ARC of adult male rats, using OVX females as an additional control group. None of the compounds affected KISS-ir in the male hypothalamus.

Nevertheless, their path of action, dose-response character, and cellular target(s) within the fetal testis are not known. In this study we investigated the effects of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and several of their metabolites on the development of organo-cultured testes from rat fetus. We removed testes from 14.5-day-old rat fetuses and cultured them for 1-3 days with or without DEHP, MEHP, and the metabolites. DEHP (10(-5) M) produced a proandrogenic effect after 3 days of culture, whereas MEHP disrupted testis morphology and function. Leydig cells were the first affected by MEHP, with a number of them being inappropriately located within some seminiferous tubules. Additionally, we found a time- and dose-dependent reduction of testosterone. By 48 hr, gonocyte proliferation had decreased, whereas apoptosis increased. Sertoli cell number was unaffected, although some cells appeared vacuolated, and production of anti-Müllerian hormone decreased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The derived metabolite mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate was the only one to cause deleterious effects to the rat fetal testis in vitro.

We used an immortalized hypothalamic GT1-7 cell line, which synthesizes the neuroendocrine peptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), to examine the neurotoxic and endocrine disrupting effects of PCBs and their mechanisms of action. Cells were treated for 1, 4, 8, or 24 h with a range of doses of a representative PCB from each of three classes: coplanar (2,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl: PCB74), dioxin-like coplanar (2',3,4,4',5' pentachlorobiphenyl: PCB118), non-coplanar (2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl: PCB153), or their combination. GnRH peptide concentrations, cell viability, apoptotic and necrotic cell death, and caspase activation were quantified. In general, GnRH peptide levels were suppressed by high doses and longer durations of PCBs, and elevated at low doses and shorter timepoints. The suppression of GnRH peptide levels was partially reversed in cultures co-treated with the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780. All PCBs reduced viability and increased both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Although the effects for the three classes of PCBs were often similar, subtle differences in responses, together with evidence that the combination of PCBs acted slightly different from individual PCBs, suggest that the three tested PCB compounds may act via slightly different or more than one mechanism. These results provide evidence that PCB congeners have endocrine disrupting and/or neurotoxic effects on the hypothalamic GnRH cell line, a finding that has implications for environmental endocrine disruption in animals.",PMC2702519

These same agencies have given much less weight in risk assessments to a large number of independently replicated non-GLP studies conducted with government funding by the leading experts in various fields of science from around the world. We reviewed differences between industry-funded GLP studies of BPA conducted by commercial laboratories for regulatory purposes and non-GLP studies conducted in academic and government laboratories to identify hazards and molecular mechanisms mediating adverse effects. We examined the methods and results in the GLP studies that were pivotal in the draft decision of the U.S. FDA declaring BPA safe in relation to findings from studies that were competitive for U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding, peer-reviewed for publication in leading journals, subject to independent replication, but rejected by the U.S. FDA for regulatory purposes. Although the U.S. FDA and EFSA have deemed two industry-funded GLP studies of BPA to be superior to hundreds of studies funded by the U.S. NIH and NIH counterparts in other countries, the GLP studies on which the agencies based their decisions have serious conceptual and methodologic flaws. In addition, the U.S. FDA and EFSA have mistakenly assumed that GLP yields valid and reliable scientific findings (i.e., ""good science""). Their rationale for favoring GLP studies over hundreds of publically funded studies ignores the central factor in determining the reliability and validity of scientific findings, namely, independent replication, and use of the most appropriate and sensitive state-of-the-art assays, neither of which is an expectation of industry-funded GLP research.

The phytoestrogen, genistein (4', 5, 7-trihydroxy-isoflavone), is a naturally occurring compound found in soy products. Genistein has been the subject of numerous studies because of its known estrogenic activity. We report that genistein exposure of zebrafish embryos induces apoptosis, mainly in the hindbrain and the anterior spinal cord. Timing experiments demonstrate that apoptosis is induced during a precise developmental window. Since adding ICI 182,780, an ER antagonist, does not rescue the genistein-induced apoptosis and since there is no synergistic effect between genistein and estradiol, we conclude that this apoptotic effect elicited by genistein is estrogen-receptors independent. However, we show in vitro, that genistein binds and activates the three zebrafish estrogen receptors ERalpha, ERbeta-A and ERbeta-B. Furthermore using transgenic ERE-Luciferase fish we show that genistein is able to activate the estrogen pathway in vivo during larval stages. Finally we show that genistein is able to induce ectopic expression of the aromatase-B gene in an ER-dependent manner in the anterior brain in pattern highly similar to the one resulting from estrogen treatment at low concentration. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT GENISTEIN ACTS THROUGH AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT PATHWAYS IN ZEBRAFISH EMBRYOS: (i) it induces apoptosis in an ER-independent manner and (ii) it regulates aromatase-B expression in the brain in an ER-dependent manner. Our results thus highlight the multiplicity of possible actions of phytoestrogens, such as genistein. This suggests that the use of standardized endpoints to study the effect of a given compound, even when this compound has well known targets, may carry the risk of overlooking interesting effects of this compound.",PMC2655710

Prevalence estimates in Europe range from 4 to 24 per 10,000 births, depending on definition, with higher rates reported from the United States. Relatively little is known about potential risk factors, but a role for endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has been proposed. Our goal was to elucidate the risk of hypospadias associated with occupational exposure of the mother to endocrine-disruptor chemicals, use of folate supplementation during pregnancy, and vegetarianism. We designed a case-control study of 471 hypospadias cases referred to surgeons and 490 randomly selected birth controls, born 1 January 1997-30 September 1998 in southeast England. Telephone interviews of mothers elicited information on folate supplementation during pregnancy and vegetarianism. We used a job exposure matrix to classify occupational exposure. In multiple logistic regression analysis, there were increased risks for self-reported occupational exposure to hair spray [exposed vs. nonexposed, odds ratio (OR) = 2.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.40-4.17] and phthalate exposure obtained by a job exposure matrix (OR = 3.12; 95% CI, 1.04-11.46). There was a significantly reduced risk of hypospadias associated with of folate use during the first 3 months of pregnancy (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.44-0.93).

Phthalate esters represent a class of environmental endocrine-active chemicals known to disrupt development of the male reproductive tract by decreasing testosterone production in the fetal rat. Using the organ culture system we developed previously, we investigated the effects on the development of human fetal testis of one phthalate--mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP)--an industrial chemical found in many products, which has been incriminated as a disruptor of male reproductive function. Human fetal testes were recovered during the first trimester (7-12 weeks) of gestation, a critical period for testicular differentiation, and cultured for 3 days with or without MEHP in basal conditions or stimulated with luteinizing hormone (LH). Whatever the dose, MEHP treatment had no effect on basal or LH-stimulated testosterone produced by the human fetal testis in vitro, although testosterone production can be modulated in our culture system. MEHP (10(-4) M) did not affect proliferation or apoptosis of Sertoli cells, but it reduced the mRNA expression of anti-Müllerian hormone. MEHP (10(-4) M) reduced the number of germ cells by increasing their apoptosis, measured by the detection of caspase-3-positive germ cells, without modification of their proliferation. This is the first experimental demonstration that phthalates alter the development of the germ cell lineage in humans.

To date, most attention has focused on the effects of BPA on the periovulatory oocyte, and considerable variation is evident in the results of these studies. In our own laboratory, variation in the results of BPA studies conducted at different times appeared to correlate with changes in mill dates of animal feed. This observation, coupled with reports by others that dietary estrogens in feed are a confounding variable in studies of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, prompted us to evaluate the effect of diet on the results of BPA studies of the periovulatory oocyte. Genetically identical females were placed on a high- or low-phytoestrogen diet prior to mating. Their female offspring were exposed to BPA, oocytes collected, and meiotic spindle and chromosome characteristics compared between control and BPA-treated females. We observed significant diet-related variation in both the frequency of abnormalities in oocytes from untreated females and in the response to BPA. Our results demonstrate that the impact of BPA on meiosis depends, at least in part, on diet. We suggest that variation in the conclusions of recent BPA studies reflects differences in the diets used, as well as other methodological differences.

This epidemic may be affected by exposure to xenobiotic chemicals. Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, is detectable at nanomolar levels in human serum worldwide. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific hormone that increases insulin sensitivity and reduces tissue inflammation. Thus, any factor that suppresses adiponectin release could lead to insulin resistance and increased susceptibility to obesity-associated diseases. In this study we aimed to compare a) the effects of low doses of BPA and estradiol (E(2)) on adiponectin secretion from human breast, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose explants and mature adipocytes, and b) expression of putative estrogen and estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) in these tissues. We determined adiponectin levels in conditioned media from adipose explants or adipocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. We determined expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha and beta, G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), and ERRs alpha, beta, and gamma by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. BPA at 0.1 and 1 nM doses suppressed adiponectin release from all adipose depots examined. Despite substantial variability among patients, BPA was as effective, and often more effective, than equimolar concentrations of E(2). Adipose tissue expresses similar mRNA levels of ERalpha, ERbeta, and ERRgamma, and 20- to 30-fold lower levels of GPR30, ERRalpha, and ERRbeta. BPA at environmentally relevant doses inhibits the release of a key adipokine that protects humans from metabolic syndrome.

To investigate the occurrence of semi-volatile endocrine-disrupting chemicals, including PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers), PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), phthalates, pyrethroids, DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and its metabolites, and chlordanes, indoor dust samples were collected from household vacuum cleaner bags provided by 10 apartments and 1 community hall in Davis, California, USA. Chemical analyses show that all indoor dust samples are highly contaminated by target analytes measured in the present study. Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate was the most abundant (104-7630 microg/g) in all samples and higher than other target analytes by 2 to 6 orders of magnitude. PBDEs were also found at high concentrations (1780-25,200 ng/g). Although the use of PCBs has been banned or restricted for decades, some samples had PCBs at levels that are considered to be concerns for human health, indicating that the potential risk posed by PCBs still remains high in the indoor environment, probably due to a lack of dissipation processes and continuous release from the sources. Although the use of some PBDEs is being phased out in some parts of the U.S., this trend may apply to PBDEs as well. We can anticipate that exposure to PBDEs will continue as long as the general public keeps using existing household items such as sofas, mattresses, and carpets that contain PBDEs.

Associations of exposures with pubertal stages (present=stage 2+ vs absent=stage 1) were examined using t-tests and Poisson multivariate regression to derive prevalence ratios (PR, 95%-confidence limits [CI]). Breast development was present in 53% of girls. DDE, Pb, and dietary intakes of phytoestrogens were not significantly associated with breast stage. Urinary phytoestrogen biomarker concentrations were lower among girls with breast development compared with no development.

Body mass index (BMI) is a hormonally relevant, strong risk factor for breast development. Therefore, BMI-modification of exposure effects was examined, and associations became stronger. Delayed breast development was observed among girls with below-median BMI and third tertile (high exposure) of urinary daidzein (PR 0.46 [0.26-0.78]); a similar effect was seen with genistein, comparing to girls >or= median BMI and lowest two tertiles (combined) of these isoflavones. With urinary enterolactone a phytoestrogen effect was seen only among girls with high BMI, where breast development was delayed among those with high urinary enterolactone (PR 0.55 [0.32-0.96] for the upper tertile vs lower two combined). There was no main effect of PCBs on breast stage, but girls with below-median BMI and >or= median PCB levels had reduced risk for breast development (any vs none) compared with other BMI-PCB groups.

Here, we tested whether PCBs administered during late pregnancy would compromise reproductive physiology in both the fetally exposed female offspring (F1 generation), as well as in their female offspring (F2 generation). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with the PCB mixture, Aroclor 1221 (A1221; 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 mg/kg), on Embryonic Days 16 and 18. Somatic and reproductive development of F1 and their F2 female offspring were monitored, including ages of eye opening, pubertal landmarks, and serum reproductive hormones. The results showed that low doses of A1221 given during this critical period of neuroendocrine development caused differential effects of A1221 on F1 and F2 female rats. In both generations, litter sex ratio was skewed toward females. In the F1 generation, additional effects were found, including a significant alteration of serum LH in the 1 mg/kg A1221 group. The F2 generation showed more profound alterations, particularly with respect to fluctuations in hormones and reproductive tract tissues across the estrous cycle. On proestrus, the day of the preovulatory GnRH/gonadotropin surge, F2 females whose mothers had been exposed perinatally to A1221 exhibited substantially suppressed LH and progesterone concentrations, and correspondingly smaller uterine and ovarian weights on estrus, compared with F2 descendants of control rats. These latter changes suggest a dysregulation of reproductive physiology. Thus, low levels of exposure to PCBs during late fetal development cause significant effects on the maturation and physiology of two generations of female offspring. These findings have implications for reproductive health and fertility of wildlife and humans.",PMC2692589

We measured urinary concentrations of BPA among male and female patients from the Massachusetts General Hospital Fertility Center. Between 2004 and 2006, 217 urine samples were collected from 82 subjects: 45 women (145 samples) and 37 men (72 samples). Of these, 24 women and men were partners and contributed 42 pairs of samples collected on the same day. Ten women became pregnant during the follow-up period. Among the 217 urine samples, the median BPA concentration was 1.20 microg/L, ranging from below the limit of detection (0.4 microg/L) to 42.6 microg/L. Age, body mass index, and sex were not significant predictors of urinary BPA concentrations. BPA urinary concentrations among pregnant women were 26% higher (-26%, +115%) than those among the same women when not pregnant (p > 0.05). The urinary BPA concentrations of the female and male partner on the same day were correlated (r = 0.36; p = 0.02). The sensitivity of classifying a subject in the highest tertile using a single urine sample was 0.64. We found a nonsignificant increase in urinary BPA concentrations in women while pregnant compared with nonpregnant samples from the same women. Samples collected from partners on the same day were correlated, suggesting shared sources of exposure.

The definition of endocrine disruption is today extended to broader endocrine regulations, and includes activation of metabolic sensors, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).

In this study, the involvement of estrogen receptors (ER) in these events was evaluated in three human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SK-BR-3. The Cd-induced signal activation patterns in the three cell lines mimicked those exhibited in response to 17 beta-estradiol. Specifically, treatment of MCF-7 cells, that express ER alpha, ER beta and GPR30, to 0.5-10 microM Cd for only 2.5 min resulted in transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Cd also triggered a gradual increase and sustained activation of AKT during the 60 min treatment period. In SK-BR-3 cells, that express only GPR30, Cd also caused a transient activation of ERK1/2, but not of AKT. In contrast, in MDA-MB-231 cells, that express only ER beta, Cd was unable to cause rapid activation of either ERK1/2 or AKT. A transient phosphorylation of ER alpha was also observed within 2.5 min of Cd exposure in the MCF-7 cells. While the estrogen receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780, did not prevent the effect of Cd on these signals, specific siRNA against hER alpha significantly reduced Cd-induced activation of ERK1/2 and completely blocked the activation of AKT. It is concluded that Cd, like estradiol, can cause rapid activation of ERK1/2 and AKT and that these signaling events are mediated by possible interaction with membrane ER alpha and GPR30, but not ER beta.",PMC3472804

We also demonstrated that BPA inhibits the deactivation activity of 4-OHT. In the present study, we intended to obtain direct evidence that BPA interacts with ERR-gamma as a strong binder, and also to clarify the structural requirements of BPA for its binding to ERR-gamma. We examined [3H]BPA in the saturation binding assay using the ligand binding domain of ERR-gamma and analyzed the result using Scatchard plot analysis. A number of BPA derivatives were tested in the competitive binding assay using [3H]BPA as a tracer and in the luciferase reporter gene assay. [3H]BPA showed a KD of 5.50 nM at a Bmax of 14.4 nmol/mg. When we examined BPA derivatives to evaluate the structural essentials required for the binding of BPA to ERR-gamma , we found that only one of the two phenol-hydroxyl groups was essential for the full binding. The maximal activity was attained when one of the methyl groups was removed. All of the potent BPA derivatives retained a high constitutive basal activity of ERR-gamma in the luciferase reporter gene assay and exhibited a distinct inhibitory activity against 4-OHT. These results indicate that the phenol derivatives are potent candidates for the endocrine disruptor that binds to ERR-gamma.",PMC2199305

However, this is not reflected adequately in current screening and assessment procedures for endocrine activity that to date determine only general parameters of thyroid function. We used several in vitro and ex vivo assays in an attempt to identify suitable biomarkers for antithyroid action testing a selected panel of putative EDCs. In vitro we detected stimulation or inhibition of iodide uptake into FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells, inhibition of thyroid hormone binding to transthyretin, agonistic or antagonistic effects in a thyroid hormone receptor-dependent reporter assay, and inhibition of thyroid peroxidase using a novel assay system based on human recombinant thyroperoxidase that might be suitable for routine screening for potential EDCs. In rats, chronic application of several EDCs led to changes in thyroid morphology, alterations of thyrotropin and thyroid hormone serum levels as well as alterations in peripheral thyroid hormone-regulated end points such as malic enzyme and type I 5'-deiodinase activity. As the effects of EDCs do not reflect classic mechanisms of hormone-dependent regulation and feedback, we believe multitarget and multimodal actions of EDCs affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. These complex effects require a diverse approach for screening, evaluation, and risk assessment of potential antithyroid compounds.

We investigated the effect in vitro of these four compounds on four key cell mechanisms including transactivation of a) the human estrogen receptor (ER), b) the human androgen receptor (AR), c) the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and d) aromatase activity. All four compounds inhibited aromatase activity and were agonists and antagonists of ER and AR, respectively. nNP increased AhR activity concentration-dependently and further increased the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin AhR action. nOP caused dual responses with a weak increased and a decreased AhR activity at lower (10(-8) M) and higher concentrations (10(-5)-10(-4) M), respectively. AhR activity was inhibited with BPA (10(-5)-10(-4) M) and weakly increased with BPA-DM (10(-5) M), respectively. nNP showed the highest relative potency (REP) compared with the respective controls in the ER, AhR, and aromatase assays, whereas similar REP was observed for the four chemicals in the AR assay. Our in vitro data clearly indicate that the four industrial compounds have ED potentials and that the effects can be mediated via several cellular pathways, including the two sex steroid hormone receptors (ER and AR), aromatase activity converting testosterone to estrogen, and AhR; AhR is involved in syntheses of steroids and metabolism of steroids and xenobiotic compounds.",PMC2174402

It is now well established that there is ubiquitous human exposure to BPA. In the general population, exposure to BPA occurs mainly by consumption of contaminated foods and beverages that have contacted epoxy resins or polycarbonate plastics. To test the hypothesis that bioactive BPA was released from polycarbonate bottles used for consumption of water and other beverages, we evaluated whether BPA migrated into water stored in new or used high-quality polycarbonate bottles used by consumers. Using a sensitive and quantitative competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, BPA was found to migrate from polycarbonate water bottles at rates ranging from 0.20 ng/h to 0.79 ng/h. At room temperature the migration of BPA was independent of whether or not the bottle had been previously used. Exposure to boiling water (100 degrees C) increased the rate of BPA migration by up to 55-fold. The estrogenic bioactivity of the BPA-like immunoreactivity released into the water samples was confirmed using an in vitro assay of rapid estrogen signaling and neurotoxicity in developing cerebellar neurons.

Endogenous estrogens, including 17beta-estradiol (E(2)), and synthetic estrogenic endocrine disruptors, such as bisphenol A (BPA), have similar effects on prostate development. Increasing exposure to estrogens within the low-dose, physiologic range results in permanent increases in the size and androgen responsiveness of the prostate, whereas exposure within the high-dose, pharmacologic range has the opposite effects. We tested the hypothesis that the low-dose effects of estrogens on the developing prostate are associated with increased expression of androgen receptor (Ar) and estrogen receptor 1 (alpha) (Esr1) genes in mesenchyme cells. Ar and Esr1 mRNA levels were quantified in primary cultures of fetal mouse prostate mesenchyme cells treated with E(2) and BPA. Ar and Esr1 mRNA expression increased in response to E(2), with thresholds of 0.001 and 0.037 nM, respectively; and in response to BPA, with a threshold of 1 nM for both mRNAs. We did not observe the expected inhibition of Ar mRNA expression by pharmacologic levels of E(2) relative to unexposed cells.

Results from studies on PCBs and behavior have shown that exposure can alter learning and memory processes and that these shifts in cognitive abilities can be related to changes in hormonal and neural function. Little experimentation has been done on the impact of exposure to PCBs on social and emotional development. Previous work has shown that exposure to PCBs in children can alter play behavior. Importantly, exposure to PCBs has been found to change aspects of maternal-offspring interactions in rodents. The present study examined the impact of PCBs on maternal odor conditioning in rat pups 12-14 days of age. A modified version of the conditioned place preference paradigm was used that incorporated a maternal-associated odor cue (lemon scent) as the conditioned stimulus. PCBs significantly depressed the preference for the maternal-associated cue but did not impair discrimination for a novel odor. These effects could arise due to changes in the social dynamics between the dam and offspring after co-exposure to PCBs. For example, dams exposed to PCBs during gestation have been found to show elevated grooming directed towards pups exposed to PCBs. This change in maternal care can have dramatic effects on behavioral and hormonal systems in the developing rat pup.

CAR-null (CAR -/-) mice show no increased expression of Cyp2b following NP treatment, indicating that CAR is required for NP-mediated Cyp2b induction. In addition, NP increases the translocation of CAR into the nucleus, which is the key step in the commencement of CAR's transcriptional activity. NP also induced CYP2B6 in primary human hepatocytes, and increased Cyp2b10 messenger RNA and protein expression in humanized CAR mice, indicating that NP is an activator of human CAR as well.

This system represents an important environmental interest, because a wide variety of molecules, known as endocrine disruptors, can bind to the estrogen receptor (ER) and induce adverse health effects in wildlife and humans. Using proper experimental conditions, the nanoESI-MS approach allowed for the detection of specific ligand interactions with hERalpha LBD. The relative gas-phase stability of selected hERalpha LBD-ligand complexes did not mirror the binding affinity in solution, a result that demonstrates the prominent role of hydrophobic contacts for stabilizing ER-ligand complexes in solution. The best approach to evaluate relative solution-binding affinity by nanoESI-MS was to perform competitive binding experiments with 17beta-estradiol (E2) used as a reference ligand. Among the ligands tested, the relative binding affinity for hERalpha LBD measured by nanoESI-MS was 4-hydroxtamoxifen approximately diethylstilbestrol > E2 >> genistein >> bisphenol A, consistent with the order of the binding affinities in solution. The limited reproducibility of the bound to free protein ratio measured by nanoESI-MS for this system only allowed the binding constants (K(d)) to be estimated (low nanomolar range for E2). The specificity of nanoESI-MS combined with its speed (1 min/ligand), low sample consumption (90 pmol protein/ligand), and its sensitivity for ligand (30 ng/mL) demonstrates that this technique is a promising method for screening suspected endocrine disrupting compounds and to qualitatively evaluate their binding affinity.",PMC2206638

Some PCB mixtures can act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) by mimicking or antagonizing the actions of hormones in the brain and periphery. When exposure to hormonally active substances such as PCBs occurs during vulnerable developmental periods, particularly prenatally or in early postnatal life, they can disrupt sex-specific patterning of the brain, inducing permanent changes that can later be manifested as improper sexual behaviors. Here, we investigated the effects of prenatal exposure to the PCB mixture Aroclor (A) 1221 on adult female reproductive behaviors in a dose-response model in the Sprague-Dawley rat. Using a paced mating paradigm that permits the female to set the timing of mating and control contact with the male during copulation, we were able to uncover significant differences in female-typical sexual activities in A1221-exposed females. Specifically, A1221 causes significant effects on mating trial pacing, vocalizations, ambulation and the female's likelihood to mate. The results further demonstrate that the intermediate treatment group has the greatest number of disrupted endpoints, suggestive of non-linear dose responses to A1221. These data demonstrate that the behavioral phenotype in adulthood is disrupted by low, ecologically relevant exposures to PCBs, and the results have implications for reproductive success and health in wildlife and women.",PMC2692581

We report here that neonatal PCB or low-level DES exposure resulted in the down-regulation of Wnt7a expression. In addition, both PCB and low-level DES exposure induced changes in the uterine myometrium and gland formation. These data reveal that weak estrogens such as the PCBs act through a Wnt7a-dependent pathway and suggest that Wnt7a regulation is a sensitive biomarker for testing weak estrogenic candidate compounds. The morphologic changes that were elicited by PCBs and DES were different immediately after exposure, suggesting that Wnt7a-independent pathways are also activated by one or both of these compounds. Although Wnt7a down-regulation is transient after estrogenic exposure, subsequent morphologic changes became more pronounced during postnatal and adult life, suggesting that the female reproductive tract is permanently reprogrammed after exposure even to weak estrogenic compounds. In addition, Wnt7a heterozygous mice were more sensitive to PCB exposure, revealing an important genetic predisposition to risks of environmental endocrine disruptors.",PMC1480489

A high ratio of 4-hydroxyl estradiol (4-OH-E2) to 2-hydroxyl estradiol (2-OH-E2) has been suggested as a potential biomarker for estrogen-dependent neoplasms. In this cohort study of maternal-fetal pairs, we examined the relationship of PCDD/PCDF and PCB exposure to levels of estrogen metabolites in the sera of 50 pregnant women 25-34 years of age from central Taiwan. Maternal blood was collected during the third trimester, and the placenta was collected at delivery. We measured 17 dioxin congeners, 12 dioxin-like PCBs, and 6 indicator PCBs in placenta using gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Estrogen metabolites in maternal serum were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The ratio of 4-OH-E2:2-OH-E2 decreased with increasing exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (beta=-0.124, p=0.004 by the general linear regression model, R=0.4). Meanwhile, serum levels of 4-OH-E2 increased with increasing concentrations of high-chlorinated PCDFs (i.e., 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-hepta-CDF: beta=0.454, p=0.03, R=0.30). Altered estrogen catabolism might be associated with body burdens of PCDDs/PCDFs. Our study suggests that exposure to PCDDs/PCDFs significantly affects estrogen metabolism. Therefore, PCDD/PCDF exposure must be considered when using the OH-E2 ratio as a breast cancer marker.",PMC1459929

The study included 358 men: Greenlandic Inuit's, Swedish fishermen, and Warsaw (Poland) and Kharkiv (Ukraine) inhabitants. Xenoestrogenicity of serum extracts alone (XER) and XER competitive (XERcomp) effect on 17beta-estradiol induced estrogen receptor (ER) transactivity were assessed in the hormone free, lipophilic serum fraction containing the POPs using the MVLN human breast cancer cell line. No agonistic XER activity was exhibited for Inuit serum samples, while 12 - 24% of the European samples had detectable agonistic XER activity. On the contrary, 71% of Inuit serum samples antagonized XERcomp compared to 7 - 30 % in the other regions. XER and XERcomp were not or weakly correlated to the two POP markers. XER activity of Inuit samples was negatively associated to levels of CB-153 and p,p'-DDE. For the Warsaw group a positive and negative correlation between XER and p,p'-DDE and estradiol equivalence level and CB-153 levels was found. No strong consistent association between xenoestrogenic net activity and the two POP markers was found. The results showed that the selected POP markers alone can not predict the integrated xenoestrogenic serum activity. Correlations to the POP markers were found at the extreme edge; the Inuit's and Warsaw study groups eliciting high frequency of samples with ER antagonistic and agonistic activity, respectively. We suggest that the variation in xenoestrogenic serum activity reflects differences in POP exposure mixture, genetic factors and/or life style factors.",PMC1481538

In this study the estrogenic activity of extracts of edible marine organisms for human consumption from the Mediterranean Sea was assayed. Marine organisms were collected in two different areas of the Mediterranean Sea. The estrogenic activity of tissues was assessed using an in vitro yeast reporter gene assay (S. cerevisiae RMY 326 ER-ERE). Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (congeners 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, 180) in fish tissue was also evaluated. Thirty-eight percent of extracts showed a hormone-like activity higher than 10% of the activity elicited by 10 nM 17b-estradiol (E2) used as control. Total PCB concentrations ranged from 0.002 up to 1.785 ng/g wet weight. Chemical analyses detected different levels of contamination among the species collected in the two areas, with the ones collected in the Adriatic Sea showing concentrations significantly higher than those collected in the Tyrrhenian Sea (p < 0.01).

They have been recognized to have detrimental health effects both on wildlife and humans acting as endocrine disrupters due to their ability of mimicking the action of the steroid hormones, and thus interfering with hormone response. There are several experimental evidences that they bind and activate human steroid receptors. However, despite the growing concern about the toxicological activity of endocrine disrupters, molecular data of the interaction of these compounds with biological targets are still lacking. We have used a flexible docking approach to characterize the molecular interaction of seven endocrine disrupting chemicals with estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors in the ligand-binding domain. All ligands docked in the buried hydrophobic cavity corresponding to the hormone steroid pocket. The interaction was characterized by multiple hydrophobic contacts involving a different number of residues facing the binding pocket, depending on ligands orientation. The EDC ligands did not display a unique binding mode, probably due to their lipophilicity and flexibility, which conferred them a great adaptability into the hydrophobic and large binding pocket of steroid receptors. Our results are in agreement with toxicological data on binding and allow to describe a pattern of interactions for a group of ECD to steroid receptors suggesting the requirement of a hydrophobic cavity to accommodate these chlorine carrying compounds. Although the affinity is lower than for hormones, their action can be brought about by a possible synergistic effect.",PMC1866398

One concern about endocrine-disrupting xenobiotics is the potential for additive or synergistic (i.e., greater-than-additive) effects of mixtures. A short-term dosing model to examine the effects of environmental mixtures on thyroid homeostasis has been developed. Prototypic thyroid-disrupting chemicals (TDCs) such as dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers have been shown to alter thyroid hormone homeostasis in this model primarily by up-regulating hepatic catabolism of thyroid hormones via at least two mechanisms. Our present effort tested the hypothesis that a mixture of TDCs will affect serum total thyroxine (T4) concentrations in a dose-additive manner. Young female Long-Evans rats were dosed via gavage with 18 different polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons [2 dioxins, 4 dibenzofurans, and 12 PCBs, including dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like PCBs] for 4 consecutive days. Serum total T4 was measured via radioimmunoassay in samples collected 24 hr after the last dose. Extensive dose-response functions (based on seven to nine doses per chemical) were determined for individual chemicals. A mixture was custom synthesized with the ratio of chemicals based on environmental concentrations. Serial dilutions of this mixture ranged from approximately background levels to 100-fold greater than background human daily intakes. Six serial dilutions of the mixture were tested in the same 4-day assay. Doses of individual chemicals that were associated with a 30% TH decrease from control (ED30), as well as predicted mixture outcomes were calculated using a flexible single-chemical-required method applicable to chemicals with differing dose thresholds and maximum-effect asymptotes. The single-chemical data were modeled without and with the mixture data to determine, respectively, the expected mixture response (the additivity model) and the experimentally observed mixture response (the empirical model). A likelihood-ratio test revealed statistically significant departure from dose additivity. There was no deviation from additivity at the lowest doses of the mixture, but there was a greater-than-additive effect at the three highest mixtures doses. At high doses the additivity model underpredicted the empirical effects by 2- to 3-fold. These are the first results to suggest dose-dependent additivity and synergism in TDCs that may act via different mechanisms in a complex mixture. The results imply that cumulative risk approaches be considered when assessing the risk of exposure to chemical mixtures that contain TDCs.",PMC1310917

In addition, it has other extrahepatic effects ranging from lipolysis in adipose tissue to the control of satiety in the central nervous system. In this article, we show that the endocrine disruptors bisphenol A (BPA) and diethylstilbestrol (DES), at a concentration of 10(-9) M, suppressed low-glucose-induced intracellular calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) oscillations in alpha-cells, the signal that triggers glucagon secretion. This action has a rapid onset, and it is reproduced by the impermeable molecule estradiol (E2) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (E-HRP). Competition studies using E-HRP binding in immunocytochemically identified alpha-cells indicate that 17beta-E2, BPA, and DES share a common membrane-binding site whose pharmacologic profile differs from the classical ER. The effects triggered by BPA, DES, and E2 are blocked by the G alpha i- and G alpha o-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, by the guanylate cyclase-specific inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, and by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The effects are reproduced by 8-bromo-guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate and suppressed in the presence of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor KT-5823.

Compared with the preorganochlorine era studied (1852-1929), the percentage of intersex cricket frogs increased during the period of industrial growth and initial uses of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (1930-1945), was highest during the greatest manufacture and use of p,p-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and PCBs (1946-1959), began declining with the increase in public concern and environmental regulations that reduced and then prevented sales of DDT in the United States (1960-1979), and continued to decline through the period of gradual reductions in environmental residues of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in the midwestern United States (1980-2001). The proportion of intersex individuals among those frogs was highest in the heavily industrialized and urbanized northeastern portion of Illinois, intermediate in the intensively farmed central and northwestern areas, and lowest in the less intensively managed and ecologically more diverse southern part of the state.

The aim of this study is to measure the levels of PCBs and OH-PCBs in maternal and cord blood samples in a population with background levels of PCBs. We analyzed 51 maternal and corresponding cord blood samples in the northern part of the Netherlands. The PCB concentrations in maternal plasma ranged from 2 to 293 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations from nondetectable (ND) to 0.62 ng/g fresh weight. In cord plasma, PCB concentrations were 1-277 ng/g lipid, and OH-PCB concentrations, ND to 0.47 ng/g fresh weight. The cord versus maternal blood calculated ratio was 1.28 +/- 0.56 for PCBs and 2.11 +/- 1.33 for OH-PCBs, expressed per gram of lipid. When expressed per gram fresh weight, the ratios are 0.32 +/- 0.15 and 0.53 +/- 0.23 for PCBs and OH-PCBs, respectively. A significant correlation between the respective maternal and cord levels for both PCBs and OH-PCBs was found.

Even if the estrogenic activity of all compounds were known, the combined effect of possible additive and/or inhibiting interaction of xenoestrogens in a biological sample may be difficult to predict from chemical analysis of single compounds alone. Thus, analysis of mixtures allows evaluation of combined effects of chemicals each present at low concentrations. We have developed an optimized in vitro E-Screen test to assess the combined functional estrogenic response of human serum. The xenoestrogens in serum were separated from endogenous steroids and pharmaceuticals by solid-phase extraction followed by fractionation by high-performance liquid chromatography. After dissolution of the isolated fraction in ethanol-DMSO, the reconstituted extract was added with estrogen-depleted fetal calf serum to MCF-7 cells, the growth of which is stimulated by estrogen. After a 6-day incubation on a microwell plate, cell proliferation was assessed and compared with the effect of a 17-beta-estradiol standard. To determine the applicability of this approach, we assessed the estrogenicity of serum samples from 30 pregnant and 60 non-pregnant Danish women thought to be exposed only to low levels of endocrine disruptors. We also studied 211 serum samples from pregnant Faroese women, whose marine diet included whale blubber that contain a high concentration of persistent halogenated pollutants. The estrogenicity of the serum from Danish controls exceeded the background in 22.7 % of the cases, while the same was true for 68.1 % of the Faroese samples. The increased estrogenicity response did not correlate with the lipid-based concentrations of individual suspected endocrine disruptors in the Faroese samples. When added along with the estradiol standard, an indication of an enhanced estrogenic response was found in most cases.

Our aims in this study were to devise robust methodologies suitable for extracting potential EDCs and to measure their summated effects on activities of androgen receptors (ARs) and estrogen receptors (ER-alpha and ER-beta) in marine samples from Singapore's coastal waters. In this study, we examined the ability of C18, hydrophilic and lipophilic balance, and diol cartridges to extract potential EDCs from seawater samples. Extracts from C18 cartridges exhibited the highest sex hormone bioactivities in reporter gene assays based on a human cell line expressing AR, ER-alpha, and ER-beta. Examination of extracts from 20 coastal locations showed high androgenic and estrogenic agonist activities in confined clusters closest to the main island of Singapore. Sex hormone activity declined rapidly in clusters farther from the main coastline and in more open waters. Unexpectedly, surface and mid-depth samples from the confined high-activity clusters, in the presence of hormone, exhibited AR and ER-alpha activities that were 200-900% higher than those observed for the cognate hormone alone. This enhanced sex hormone activity suggests that analyses of complex seawater mixtures may uncover unusual bioactivities that may not be obvious by studying individual compounds.

Both BPA and NP significantly enhanced IL-4 production in keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH)-primed CD4+ T cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment with BPA or NP in vivo resulted in significant increase of IL-4 production in CD4+ T cells and of antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in the sera of KLH-primed mice. Furthermore, BPA and NP enhanced the activation of IL-4 gene promoter in EL4 T cells transiently transfected with IL-4 promoter/reporter constructs, and the enhancing effect mapped to a region in the IL-4 promoter containing binding sites for nuclear factor (NF)-AT. Activation of T lymphocytes by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin resulted in markedly enhanced binding activities to the NF-AT site, which significantly increased upon addition of BPA or NP, as demonstrated by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, indicating that the transcription factor NF-AT was involved in the enhancing effect of BPA and NP on IL-4 production.

In the current study we examine the effects of three endocrine-disrupting compounds, chlordane, trans-nonachlor, and the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture Aroclor 1242, on the steroid hormone concentrations of red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings treated in ovo. Basal steroid concentrations and steroid concentrations in response to follicle-stimulating hormone were examined in both male and female turtles treated with each of the three compounds. Treated male turtles exposed to Aroclor 1242 or chlordane exhibited significantly lower testosterone concentrations than controls, whereas chlordane-treated females had significantly lower progesterone, testosterone, and 5[alpha]-dihydrotestosterone concentrations relative to controls. The effects of these endocrine disruptors extend beyond embryonic development, altering sex-steroid physiology in exposed animals.",PMC1638010

It is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the literature but reflects workshop discussions. ""The Characterizing the Effects of Endocrine Disruptors on Human Health at Environmental Exposure Levels,"" workshop provided a forum to discuss the methods and data needed to improve risk assessments of endocrine disruptors. This article contains an overview of endocrine-related (estrogen and thyroid system) interactions and other low-dose effects of PCBs. The data set on endocrine effects includes results obtained from mechanistic methods/ and models (receptor based, metabolism based, and transport protein based), as well as from (italic)in vivo(/italic) models, including studies with experimental animals and wildlife species. Other low-dose effects induced by PCBs, such as neurodevelopmental and reproductive effects and endocrine-sensitive tumors, have been evaluated with respect to a possible causative linkage with PCB-induced alterations in endocrine systems. In addition, studies of low-dose exposure and effects in human populations are presented and critically evaluated. A list of conclusions and recommendations is included.",PMC1567499

9831536,"M Johansson, S Nilsson, B O Lund",Interactions between methylsulfonyl PCBs and the glucocorticoid receptor.,1998,"Persistent polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) metabolites were studied with respect to their interaction with the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR). 3-Methylsulphonyl-2,5,6,2',4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (3-MeSO2-CB149) was shown to compete with 3H-dexamethasone for binding to the GR, with an IC50 (concentration that inhibits 50%) of approximately 1 microM. Using GRAF cells expressing human GR, glucocorticoid responsive element, and a reporter enzyme, we demonstrated that 3-MeSO2-CB149 functionally acts as an antagonist at the GR (IC50 = 2.7 microM). In accordance with the receptor binding, the antagonism mainly appeared to be of a competitive nature. When studying the competitive binding of 24 methylsulfonyl PCBs (relative to dexamethasone) to GR from mouse liver cytosol, seven compounds had a higher affinity to GR than 3-MeSO2-CB149. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that the presence of three chlorine atoms in the ortho-position and chlorine and methyl sulfone groups on either end of the molecule (4 and 4'-position) increased the affinity to GR. The relevance of this finding for human health is not known, but PCB methyl sulfones are ubiquitous pollutants present in mother's milk. The results stress the need for studying endocrine disruptors that affect hormonal systems other than sex and thyroidogenic hormones.",PMC1533237
9721254,"R Bolger, T E Wiese, K Ervin, S Nestich, W Checovich",Rapid screening of environmental chemicals for estrogen receptor binding capacity.,1998,"Over the last few years, an increased awareness of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and their potential to affect wildlife and humans has produced a demand for practical screening methods to identify endocrine activity in a wide range of environmental and industrial chemicals. While it is clear that in vivo methods will be required to identify adverse effects produced by these chemicals, in vitro assays can define particular mechanisms of action and have the potential to be employed as rapid and low-cost screens for use in large scale EDC screening programs. Traditional estrogen receptor (ER) binding assays are useful for characterizing a chemical's potential to be an estrogen-acting EDC, but they involve displacement of a radioactive ligand from crude receptor preparations at low temperatures. The usefulness of these assays for realistically determining the ER binding interactions of weakly estrogenic environmental and industrial compounds that have low aqueous solubility is unclear. In this report, we present a novel fluorescence polarization (FP) method that measures the capacity of a competitor chemical to displace a high affinity fluorescent ligand from purified, recombinant human ER-[alpha] at room temperature. The ER-[alpha] binding interactions generated for 15 natural and synthetic compounds were found to be similar to those determined with traditional receptor binding assays. We also discuss the potential to employ this FP technology to binding studies involving ER-ss and other receptors. Thus, the assay introduced in this study is a nonradioactive receptor binding method that shows promise as a high throughput screening method for large-scale testing of environmental and industrial chemicals for ER binding interactions.",PMC1533147
9703492,S H Safe,Hazard and risk assessment of chemical mixtures using the toxic equivalency factor approach.,1998,"There is considerable public, regulatory, and scientific concern regarding human exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which include compounds that directly modulate steroid hormone receptor pathways (estrogens, antiestrogens, androgens, antiandrogens) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists, including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds. Based on quantitative structure-activity relationships for both AhR and estrogen receptor (ER) agonists, the relative potency (RP) of individual compounds relative to a standard (e.g. TCDD and 17-beta-estradiol) have been determined for several receptor-mediated responses. Therefore, the TCDD or estrogenic equivalent (TEQ or EQ, respectively) of a mixture is defined as TEQ = sigma[T(i)]xRP(i)or EQ=sigma[E(i)]xRP(i), where T(i) and E(i) are concentrations of individual AhR or ER agonists in any mixture. This approach for risk assessment of endocrine-disrupting mixtures assumes that for each endocrine response pathway, the effects of individual compounds are essentially additive. This paper will critically examine the utility of the TEQ/EQ approach for risk assessment, the validity of the assumptions used for this approach, and the problems associated with comparing low dose exposures to xeno and natural (dietary) endocrine disruptors.",PMC1533329
