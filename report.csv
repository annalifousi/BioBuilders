38704805,the physiological and biochemical basis of potency thresholds modeled using human estrogen receptor alpha implications for identifying endocrine disruptors,the endocrine system functions by interactions between ligands and receptors ligands exhibit potency for binding to and interacting with receptors potency is the product of affinity and efficacy potency and physiological concentration determine the ability of a ligand to produce physiological effects the kinetic behavior of ligandreceptor interactions conforms to the laws of mass action the laws of mass action define the relationship between the affinity of a ligand and the fraction of cognate receptors that it occupies at any physiological concentration we previously identified the minimum ligand potency required to produce clinically observable estrogenic agonist effects via the human estrogen receptoralpha erα by examining data on botanical estrogens and dietary supplements we demonstrated that erα ligands with potency lower than one onethousandth that of the primary endogenous hormone 17βestradiol e2 do not produce clinically observable estrogenic effects this allowed us to propose a humanrelevant potency threshold hrpt for erα ligands of 1  104 relative to e2 here we test the hypothesis that the hrpt for erα arises from the receptor occupancy by the normal metabolic milieu of endogenous erα ligands the metabolic milieu comprises precursors to hormones metabolites of hormones and other normal products of metabolism we have calculated fractional receptor occupancies for erα ligands with potencies below and above the previously established hrpt when normal circulating levels of some endogenous erα ligands and e2 were also present fractional receptor occupancy calculations showed that individual erα ligands with potencies more than tenfold higher than the hrpt can compete for occupancy at erα against individual components of the endogenous metabolic milieu and against mixtures of those components at concentrations found naturally in human blood ligands with potencies less than tenfold higher than the hrpt were unable to compete successfully for erα these results show that the hrpt for erα agonism 104 relative to e2 proposed previously is quite conservative and should be considered strong evidence against the potential for disruption of the estrogenic pathway for chemicals with potency 103 of e2 the potential for estrogenic endocrine disruption must be considered equivocal and subject to the presence of corroborative evidence most importantly this work demonstrates that the

morphology and stage viiviii testicular seminiferous epithelium blastocyst formation and cleavage development rate were evaluated using ivf bpa acted by binding to ers and g proteincoupled receptors and activating the protein kinase a and mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling pathways leading to aberrant hormone levels and effects on the respiratory chain complex atp synthase and proteinrelated apoptotic pathways in testis mitochondria p  005 subsequently embryo cleavage and blastocyst formation were reduced after the use of affected sperm and abnormal morphology of seminiferous tubules and stage vii and viii seminiferous epithelial cells p  005 was observed it is noteworthy that histopathological lesions were detected in the testes at the loael dose even though the mice remained generally healthy and did not exhibit significant changes in bw following bpa exposure these observations suggest that testicular toxicity is more than a secondary outcome of compromised overall health in the mice due to systemic effects not applicable since the protein expression levels in the testes were validated in vitro studies in each testicular cell type leydig cells sertoli cells and spermatogonial stem cells would be required to shed further light on the exact mechanism resulting from bpa exposure furthermore the bpa doses employed in this study significantly exceed the typical human exposure levels in reallife scenarios consequently it is imperative to conduct experiments focusing on the effects of bpa concentrations more in line with daily human exposures to comprehensively assess their impact on testicular toxicity and mitochondrial activity these findings demonstrate that bpa exposure impacts male fertility by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics and activities in the testes and provides a solid foundation for subsequent investigations into the effects on male reproductive function and fertility following bpa exposure and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects in addition these findings suggest that the loael concentration of bpa demonstrates exceptional toxicity especially when considering its specific impact on the testes and its adverse consequences for male fertility by impairing mitochondrial activity therefore it is plausible to suggest that bpa elicits distinct toxicological responses and mechanistic endpoints based on the particular concentration levels for each target organ this work was supported by the basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea

and activating the protein kinase a and mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling pathways leading to aberrant hormone levels and effects on the respiratory chain complex atp synthase and proteinrelated apoptotic pathways in testis mitochondria p  005 subsequently embryo cleavage and blastocyst formation were reduced after the use of affected sperm and abnormal morphology of seminiferous tubules and stage vii and viii seminiferous epithelial cells p  005 was observed it is noteworthy that histopathological lesions were detected in the testes at the loael dose even though the mice remained generally healthy and did not exhibit significant changes in bw following bpa exposure these observations suggest that testicular toxicity is more than a secondary outcome of compromised overall health in the mice due to systemic effects not applicable since the protein expression levels in the testes were validated in vitro studies in each testicular cell type leydig cells sertoli cells and spermatogonial stem cells would be required to shed further light on the exact mechanism resulting from bpa exposure furthermore the bpa doses employed in this study significantly exceed the typical human exposure levels in reallife scenarios consequently it is imperative to conduct experiments focusing on the effects of bpa concentrations more in line with daily human exposures to comprehensively assess their impact on testicular toxicity and mitochondrial activity these findings demonstrate that bpa exposure impacts male fertility by disrupting mitochondrial dynamics and activities in the testes and provides a solid foundation for subsequent investigations into the effects on male reproductive function and fertility following bpa exposure and the underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects in addition these findings suggest that the loael concentration of bpa demonstrates exceptional toxicity especially when considering its specific impact on the testes and its adverse consequences for male fertility by impairing mitochondrial activity therefore it is plausible to suggest that bpa elicits distinct toxicological responses and mechanistic endpoints based on the particular concentration levels for each target organ this work was supported by the basic science research program through the national research foundation of korea

north shore of lake apopka and they are still detectable in soil wild largemouth bass that inhabit the lake and the marshes along the north shore have been exposed to a variety of organochlorine pesticides including dieldrin methoxychlor and ppdde among others while these other organochlorine pesticides have been studied for their endocrine disrupting effects in largemouth bass there is little information for toxaphene in this study male and female largemouth bass were given food containing 50 mgkg toxaphene for almost 3 months to achieve tissue levels similar to those found in fish at lake apopka sexspecific toxicity was then evaluated by measuring various reproductive endpoints and transcriptomic changes in females gonadosomatic index showed a trend towards reduction p  0051 and plasma vitellogenin was reduced by 40 relative to controls however plasma levels of 17βestradiol and testosterone were not perturbed by toxaphene exposure these data suggest that toxaphene does not act as a weak estrogen as many other organochlorine pesticides do but rather appears to be acting as an antiestrogen in female fish there were no obvious changes in the gonadosomatic index and plasma hormones in male bass however ex vivo explant experiments revealed that toxaphene prevented human chorionic gonadotropinstimulated testosterone production in the testis this suggested that toxaphene had antiandrogenic effects in males subsequent transcriptomic analyses of the testis revealed that androgen receptorbeta2microglobulin signaling was upregulated while insulinrelated pathways were suppressed with toxaphene which could be interpreted as a compensatory response to androgen suppression in the male liver the transcriptome analysis revealed an overwhelming suppression in immunerelated signaling cascades eg lectinlike receptor and itsmcontaining receptor signaling cd16cd14 proinflammatory monocyte activation and cd38cd3junfosnfkb signaling in tcell proliferation

packaging materials and other consumer products several pfas have been identified as endocrinedisrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that pfas exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for womens health this review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between pfas exposure and ovarian function a comprehensive review was performed by searching pubmed search terms included an extensive list of pfas and health terms ranging from general keywords eg ovarian reproductive follicle oocyte to specific keywords including menarche menstrual cycle menopause primary ovarian insufficiencypremature ovarian failure steroid hormones based on the authors knowledge of the topic and key terms clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of pfas in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the bloodfollicle barrier although some studies found no evidence associating pfas exposure with disruption in ovarian function numerous epidemiologic studies mostly with crosssectional study designs have identified associations of higher pfas exposure with later menarche irregular menstrual cycles longer cycle length earlier age of menopause and reduced levels of oestrogens and androgens adverse effects of pfas on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis have been confirmed in experimental models based on laboratory research findings pfas could diminish ovarian reserve and reduce endogenous hormone synthesis through activating peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors disrupting gap junction intercellular communication between oocyte and granulosa cells inducing thyroid hormone deficiency antagonising ovarian enzyme activities involved in ovarian steroidogenesis or inhibiting kisspeptin signalling in the hypothalamus the published literature supports associations between pfas exposure and adverse reproductive outcomes however the evidence remains insufficient to infer a causal relationship between pfas exposure and ovarian disorders thus more research is warranted pfas are of significant concern because these chemicals are ubiquitous and persistent in the environment and in humans moreover susceptible groups such as foetuses and pregnant women may be exposed to harmful combinations of chemicals that include pfas however the role environmental exposures play in reproductive disorders has received little attention by the medical community to better understand the potential risk of pfas on human ovarian function additional experimental studies using pfas doses equivalent to the exposure levels found in the general human population and mixtures of compounds are required prospective investigations in human populations are also warranted to ensure the temporality of pfas exposure and health endpoints and to minimise the possibility of reverse causality,perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are found widespread in drinking water foods food packaging materials and other consumer products several pfas have been identified as endocrinedisrupting chemicals based on their ability to interfere with normal reproductive function and hormonal signalling experimental models and epidemiologic studies suggest that pfas exposures target the ovary and represent major risks for womens health this review summarises human population and toxicological studies on the association between pfas exposure and ovarian function a comprehensive review was performed by searching pubmed search terms included an extensive list of pfas and health terms ranging from general keywords eg ovarian reproductive follicle oocyte to specific keywords including menarche menstrual cycle menopause primary ovarian insufficiencypremature ovarian failure steroid hormones based on the authors knowledge of the topic and key terms clinical evidence demonstrates the presence of pfas in follicular fluid and their ability to pass through the bloodfollicle barrier although some studies found no evidence associating pfas exposure with disruption in ovarian function numerous epidemiologic studies mostly with crosssectional study designs have identified associations of higher pfas exposure with later menarche irregular menstrual

27478869,developmental exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals alters the epigenome identification of reprogrammed targets,endocrine disruptions induced by environmental toxicants have placed an immense burden on society to properly diagnose treat and attempt to alleviate symptoms and disease environmental exposures during critical periods of development can permanently reprogram normal physiological responses thereby increasing susceptibility to disease later in life  a process known as developmental reprogramming during development organogenesis and tissue differentiation occur through a continuous series of tightlyregulated and preciselytimed molecular biochemical and cellular events humans may encounter endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs daily and during all stages of life from conception and fetal development through adulthood and senescence though puberty and perimenopausal periods may be affected by endocrine disruption due to hormonal effects prenatal and early postnatal windows are most critical for proper development due to rapid changes in system growth developmental reprogramming is shown to be caused by alterations in the epigenome development is the time when epigenetic programs are installed on the genome by writers such as histone methyltransferases hmts and dna methyltransferases dnmts which add methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues on histone tails and to cpg sites in dna respectively a number of environmental compounds referred to as estrogenic endocrine disruptors eeds are able to bind to estrogen receptors ers and interfere with the normal cellular development in target tissues including the prostate and uterus these eeds including diethylstilbestrol des bisphenol a bpa and genistein a phytoestrogen derived from soybeans have been implicated in the malformation of reproductive organs and later development of disease due to the lack of fully understanding the underlying mechanisms of how environmental toxicants and their level of exposure affect the human genome it can be challenging to create clear clinical guidance to address the potential health effects of lowerlevel exposures commonly experienced within the general population in addition human studies concerning environmental exposures are limited in feasibility by ethical concerns for human safety therefore studies in animal models provide great opportunities to reveal links between earlylife exposure to edcs and related diseases it has been shown that developmental exposure to edcs such as diethylstilbestrol des and genistein during reproductive tract development increases the incidence multiplicity and overall size of uterine fibroids in the eker rat model concomitantly reprogramming estrogenresponsive gene expression importantly edc exposure represses enhancer of zeste 2 ezh2 and reduces levels of the histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation h3k27me3 repressive mark through estrogen receptor  phosphatidylinositide 3kinases  protein kinase b nongenomic signaling in the developing uterus more recent research identified a developmental reprogramming target scbg2a1 gene whose epigenetic status can be altered by early exposure to bpa in the rat prostate molecular analyses revealed markedly increased expression greater than 100 fold of scgb2a1 a secretaglobin gene in response to developmental exposure to bpa this increase in scgb2a1 expression is concomitantly associated with increased enrichment of acetylated h3k9 h3k9ac representing active chromatin status and hypomethylation of dna for a cpg island upstream of the transcription start site of scgb2a1 these data suggest that expression of scgb2a1 in the adult prostate could be epigenetically reprogrammed by bpa exposure during prostate development further studies are needed to create more targeted preventative interventions as well as specific effective therapeutics to decrease the incidence of diseases,endocrine disruptions induced by

tissue differentiation occur through a continuous series of tightlyregulated and preciselytimed molecular biochemical and cellular events humans may encounter endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs daily and during all stages of life from conception and fetal development through adulthood and senescence though puberty and perimenopausal periods may be affected by endocrine disruption due to hormonal effects prenatal and early postnatal windows are most critical for proper development due to rapid changes in system growth developmental reprogramming is shown to be caused by alterations in the epigenome development is the time when epigenetic programs are installed on the genome by writers such as histone methyltransferases hmts and dna methyltransferases dnmts which add methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues on histone tails and to cpg sites in dna respectively a number of environmental compounds referred to as estrogenic endocrine disruptors eeds are able to bind to estrogen receptors ers and interfere with the normal cellular development in target tissues including the prostate and uterus these eeds including diethylstilbestrol des bisphenol a bpa and genistein a phytoestrogen derived from soybeans have been implicated in the malformation of reproductive organs and later development of disease due to the lack of fully understanding the underlying mechanisms of how environmental toxicants and their level of exposure affect the human genome it can be challenging to create clear clinical guidance to address the potential health effects of lowerlevel exposures commonly experienced within the general population in addition human studies concerning environmental exposures are limited in feasibility by ethical concerns for human safety therefore studies in animal models provide great opportunities to reveal links between earlylife exposure to edcs and related diseases it has been shown that developmental exposure to edcs such as diethylstilbestrol des and genistein during reproductive tract development increases the incidence multiplicity and overall size of uterine fibroids in the eker rat model concomitantly reprogramming estrogenresponsive gene expression importantly edc exposure represses enhancer of zeste 2 ezh2 and reduces levels of the histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation h3k27me3 repressive mark through estrogen receptor  phosphatidylinositide 3kinases  protein kinase b nongenomic signaling in the developing uterus more recent research identified a developmental reprogramming target scbg2a1 gene whose epigenetic status can be altered by early exposure to bpa in the rat prostate molecular analyses revealed markedly increased expression greater than 100 fold of scgb2a1 a secretaglobin gene in response to developmental exposure to bpa this increase in scgb2a1 expression is concomitantly associated with increased enrichment of acetylated h3k9 h3k9ac representing active chromatin status and hypomethylation of dna for a cpg island upstream of the transcription start site of scgb2a1 these data suggest that expression of scgb2a1 in the adult prostate could be epigenetically reprogrammed by bpa exposure during prostate development further studies are needed to create more targeted preventative interventions as well as specific effective therapeutics to decrease the incidence of diseases,"induced(ACTIVITY),

this area including parabens alkylphenolic compounds and bisphenola bpa a number of possible sources of pollution are present in the area including the large harbours present in the lagoon the city of aveiro and the rivers discharging into the area a recently constructed submarine wastewater outfall located a few kilometres from the lagoon inlet has also been suggested as a possible source of pollution to ria de aveiro in several publications the aim of the current field study was to investigate the occurrence and main sources of phenolic endocrine disruptors in ria de aveiro an extensive sampling campaign was performed with surface water and wastewater grab samples taken at over 50 locations in duplicate on different days samples were treated using solid phase extraction and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry concentrations in lagoon water were generally low not exceeding 20 ngl for most analytes levels in river water exceeded those in the lagoon by a factor 3 to 500 ophenylphenol php and nonylphenoxy ethoxy acetic acids a9pec respectively with concentrations up to 700 ngl for bpa and 7300 ngl for a9pec samples from the harbours showed edc levels similar to those in the rest of the lagoon but in the city of aveiro elevated concentrations were observed for alkylphenol ethoxylates a9peo a9pec php and bpa wastewater effluents showed low levels for parabens whilst alkylphenolic compounds reached several micrograms per litre the effluents are discharged into the ocean via a submarine outfall but as marine water near the outfall showed
